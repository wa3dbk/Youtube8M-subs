 accidents in the lines of 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.280
 metrobus continue to register and maybe 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.830
 are becoming more frequent in 2005 than 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 a couple here very close to our 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.810
 see facilities you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 today a new accident occurred in the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 line 4 of the metrobus downtown 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.059

 truck with official number 550 event 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.570
 agreement with witnesses to a couple in the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 outskirts of the secretariat of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 governor the man by the name of jose 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 Luis López was injured and was 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 transferred to a hospital by a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.830
 ambulance an official of the company 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.280
 present in the place refused to give 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.280
 reports 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.110
 according to witnesses even though 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.850
 the pedestrian was careless when crossing 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.850
 the driver wanted to take flight 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.259
 the accident is one of many 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.619
 occur continuously in this service 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.229
 of transport only from 2005 year in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.330
 who started his service in 2011 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.590
 there were 36 accidents that have left 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.270
 three dead and more than 100 injured 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.640
 although the federal district government 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.380
 says that 68 percent of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.780
 accidents are the fault of the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.399
 motorists to give for life or 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.500
 of pedestrians for not respecting the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.719
 signs what is clear is that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.390
 there are also missing visible signs and 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.890
 good size for people effect 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.820
 TV 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.060
 and what influences these shocks some 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.040
 they say that maybe it's the bad signage 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.690
 others that is the carelessness of the people my 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.490
 compañera paola olivares and is in the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.650
 area of the accident to tell us that 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.119
 is what he observes about this 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.740
 subject and he gives us his report 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.860
 paola I greet you with pleasure good afternoon 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.410
 ahead 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.150
 je his friends of metropolitan effect 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.399
 good afternoon, I am in the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.530
 Juarez Avenue with Balderas Avenue 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.270
 one of the most conflicting crosses for 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.100
 this collective transportation system 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.930
 metro bus and is that as we can observe 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.060
 in images of my companion Jesus 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.490
 Velásquez, because in this course we also 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.230
 they lack some big signs 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.120
 so that people know in what 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.530
 moment to cross at what time not to do it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.150
 and then the truth is that also the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.800
 semaphores that are for pedestrians 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.020
 they are too small which 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.120
 Sometimes you can not observe, you can not 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.890
 appreciate and at other times the truth 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.570
 be told is that pedestrians do not 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.670
 they respect the moment when they have to 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.489
 pass or not another of the factors 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.440
 This system has the main 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.510
 of collective transport as good is 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.220
 that was originally planned for 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.780
 be in a straight line , however, for the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.730
 demographic conditions of our 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.320
 city ​​of mexico- this could not be 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.570
 so good they have had to design 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.430
 curves which makes this so 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.530
 more dangerous and a little bit more 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 conflictive because without more this is the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.140
 report from this moment Jesus very 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.140
 good afternoon
