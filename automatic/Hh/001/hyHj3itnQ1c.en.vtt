00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.540
 well then narrates then there are the people 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.610
 pretty and welcome back to this 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.040
 small channel about video games in 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.750
 this occasion is in a way that is 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.119
 neglected by the web 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.119
 and that is one of the best that has 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.840
 fascinated and you have to thank him this 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.270
 this contribution to the user come come ex 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.910
 who first showed me this world 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.070
 call follower comment overhaul or something 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.360
 so it is pronounced that what he does 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.220
 it simply modifies the 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.170
 behavior of the folios so 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.719
 that they make a lot more comments than 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.269
 normal the followers in skaer understand 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.390
 big problem that they are bored 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.789
 apart from looking pretty and splitting asses 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.530
 do nothing special is fine and 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.050
 Solves the problem and gives them more 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.510
 personality to put an example here 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.550
 to the part of miami fort what I smell lic 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.960
 what is different support for people who have 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.170
 been following my channel this is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.489
 mazzanti in another different place and good 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.070
 what I 'm going to do, what am I going to do 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.409
 now a series of recordings that 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.210
 I donated a small game to 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.220
 to see the amount of comments that 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.960
 only in the time that I moved 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.940
 from here of white race the tumulus of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.399
 the mournful cataracts to continue with 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.440
 the mission because it's a new game 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.240
 then they will notice the large amount of 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.750
 comments that she makes 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 Y 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.179
 never buy armors and offers 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.950
 hero appear on the back of his cancer and I 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 will take with him 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.190
 because we focus on retelling 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.440
 old stories there are so many new 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.620
 stories that are being written just 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.620
 now 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.420
 They say the study palian dead 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.810
 the vampires the trauger and others do not 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 dead 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 I heard something 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.480
 if you should look for a job 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.320
 I do not know if it will be a news but it seems 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.270
 that all the blacksmiths of sailing 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.650
 they want to show that they are up to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.650
 of gray hair oven 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 and then to install this comment 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.450
 down they just need to download it 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.520
 Bond description on the link 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.830
 download in the video description what 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.580
 let's open and I'll open it here with 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.320
 z zip and we're just going to put what 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.600
 is in this folder dates these two 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.540
 archives within our data 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.280
 own is to fall that simple now 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.600
 well to enter the menu of 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.790
 configuration that really the 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.550
 configuration we do not even touch but 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.010
 just in case they are going to need the sky 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.980
 white and the sk e &amp; c that are also 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.930
 inside of me within my channel but not 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.240
 it is necessary that they have those two modes 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.740
 to work well in the mode so 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.430
 except as far as I know is a stand 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.370
 alone 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.440
 Now I have to say that all the 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.680
 comments and personality that they saw 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.990
 de santis is not she so is the followers 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.600
 in followers normal post that barely 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.250
 speaks and only looks pretty all that 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.320
 personality that is generated through 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.940
 the comments is created by this mode 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.070
 that's why I recommend it so much 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.230
 because they're going to happen to have a follower 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.380
 custom because it works with pleasure and with 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.570
 normal follower download from having a 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.100
 boring follower to have a 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.970
 follower custom with a personality 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.520
 defined so good this mode comes 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.860
 Ni from remaining or c's which is 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.260
 one of my closest subscribers 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.210
 and that's why I 'm going to invite you to 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.400
 visit your channel that is being 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.890
 also dedicating videos 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.710
 download but not so much mods but 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.910
 that is more dedicated to gameplays here are 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.130
 watching for example a video about how 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.010
 as they are but no sample of how 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.530
 are the videos about the gameplay 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.880
 they do so well he invited me to see 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.910
 why really a channel that has 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.740
 very interesting videos is all if you 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.360
 I really like my job as always 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.130
 I'm going to invite you to share my 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.150
 videos that share the channel are 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.790
 subscribe comment second on the fanpage 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.950
 because nothing is to extend my work 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.390
 and reach more and more talking people 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.730
 Hispanic that game download is my 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.470
 objective and that is what motivates me to 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.930
 keep working on this this requires 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.580
 quite a while even if you do not believe it and without 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.160
 the answer as one simply what 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.470
 stop doing so good is all 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.930
 thanks for watching I hope you enjoy 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.130
 I really liked fashion and we 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.130
 we see another time
