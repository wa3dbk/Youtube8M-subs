00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.289 
still split and they still hold him up
even<00:02:38.480> better<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.049> time<00:02:39.730> he<00:02:40.730> still<00:02:41.000> has<00:02:41.120> his

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
even better this time he still has his

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.020 
even better this time he still has his
scorpion<00:02:41.750> tail<00:02:41.959> that's<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.799> sure<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.849> he

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
scorpion tail that's for sure but he

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.240 
scorpion tail that's for sure but he
still<00:02:44.359> looks<00:02:44.569> like<00:02:44.780> solar<00:02:45.049> stream<00:02:45.440> just<00:02:46.040> more

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
still looks like solar stream just more

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.080 
still looks like solar stream just more
beefed<00:02:46.489> up<00:02:46.760> he<00:02:47.540> still<00:02:47.810> has<00:02:47.989> his<00:02:48.139> winged<00:02:49.099> motion

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
beefed up he still has his winged motion

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.099 
beefed up he still has his winged motion
look<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.139> he<00:02:51.409> has<00:02:51.709> little<00:02:52.430> leg<00:02:53.329> guards<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
look and he has little leg guards on the

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.160 
look and he has little leg guards on the
sides<00:02:54.379> if<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.549> think<00:02:56.359> you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.659> make<00:02:56.900> this

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
sides if you think you can make this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.099 
sides if you think you can make this
then<00:02:57.799> I<00:02:57.950> encourage<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.840> probably

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
hope somebody does a video response and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.589 
hope somebody does a video response and
beating<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.549> because<00:03:07.909> I<00:03:07.939> think<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.389> beat

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
beating this because I think I beat

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.710 
beating this because I think I beat
solar<00:03:09.230> stream<00:03:09.709> already<00:03:09.889> this<00:03:10.459> once<00:03:10.819> time<00:03:11.359> I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
solar stream already this once time I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.550 
solar stream already this once time I
don't<00:03:12.409> know<00:03:12.680> if<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:13.159> know<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.519> better<00:03:14.120> quality

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
don't know if you know a better quality

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.619 
don't know if you know a better quality
then<00:03:15.560> upgrading<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.609> own<00:03:16.760> transformers

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
then upgrading your own transformers

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.800 
then upgrading your own transformers
because<00:03:18.470> sometimes<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.879> get<00:03:20.120> bored<00:03:20.449> of<00:03:20.629> them

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
because sometimes you get bored of them

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.199 
because sometimes you get bored of them
and<00:03:21.079> sometimes<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.220> want<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.489> destroy<00:03:22.970> them

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
and sometimes you want to destroy them

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.559 
and sometimes you want to destroy them
and<00:03:23.449> sometimes<00:03:24.169> things<00:03:25.129> go<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.669> go<00:03:25.909> the<00:03:26.239> best

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
and sometimes things go and go the best

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.349 
and sometimes things go and go the best
way<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.260> try<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.680> regret<00:03:28.370> but<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.150> don't

way and you try to regret but you don't

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.149 
way and you try to regret but you don't
regret<00:03:29.810> destroying<00:03:30.319> them<00:03:30.500> because<00:03:30.829> they're

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
regret destroying them because they're

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.740 
regret destroying them because they're
just<00:03:31.430> toys<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.299> because<00:03:34.000> they're<00:03:35.000> Lego<00:03:35.449> it

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
just toys and because they're Lego it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170 
just toys and because they're Lego it

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
doesn't really matter and you know what

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.140 
doesn't really matter and you know what
solar<00:03:38.959> stream<00:03:39.379> doesn't<00:03:39.859> care<00:03:40.129> he's<00:03:41.120> a

solar stream doesn't care he's a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.159 
solar stream doesn't care he's a
