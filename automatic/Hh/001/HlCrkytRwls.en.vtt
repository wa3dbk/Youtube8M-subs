hi<00:00:12.980> I'm<00:00:13.370> Costa<00:00:13.730> Mesa<00:00:13.820> R&amp;D<00:00:14.330> today<00:00:15.080> we<00:00:15.290> have<00:00:15.380> a

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
hi I'm Costa Mesa R&amp;D today we have a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.070 
hi I'm Costa Mesa R&amp;D today we have a
boss<00:00:15.680> 429<00:00:15.950> cylinder<00:00:16.730> head<00:00:16.880> in<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.060> shop<00:00:17.300> and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
boss 429 cylinder head in the shop and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.989 
boss 429 cylinder head in the shop and
we're<00:00:18.349> gonna<00:00:18.500> try<00:00:19.159> and<00:00:19.189> straighten<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:19.759> head

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:19.999 
we're gonna try and straighten this head

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.300 
we're gonna try and straighten this head
out<00:00:20.179> that's<00:00:20.990> quite<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.289> bit<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.560> warp<00:00:21.829> and<00:00:22.159> what

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
out that's quite a bit of warp and what

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.579 
out that's quite a bit of warp and what
I<00:00:22.339> was<00:00:22.519> actually<00:00:22.730> doing<00:00:22.939> was<00:00:23.419> checking<00:00:24.140> to<00:00:24.320> see

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
I was actually doing was checking to see

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.579 
I was actually doing was checking to see
how<00:00:24.619> much<00:00:24.829> work<00:00:25.189> there<00:00:25.429> was<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:26.230> I<00:00:27.230> can

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
how much work there was and I can

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.450 
how much work there was and I can
actually<00:00:27.800> rock<00:00:28.369> my<00:00:29.470> straightedge<00:00:30.470> from<00:00:31.249> one

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
actually rock my straightedge from one

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.090 
actually rock my straightedge from one
end<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.909> other<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:33.380> got<00:00:33.530> about<00:00:33.680> all

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
end to the other and we got about all

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.279 
end to the other and we got about all
close<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.880> three<00:00:35.239> thirty-seconds<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:35.989> an<00:00:36.140> inch

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
close to three thirty-seconds of an inch

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.889 
close to three thirty-seconds of an inch
of<00:00:36.469> warp<00:00:36.800> on<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.160> head<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:37.850> we're<00:00:38.570> gonna<00:00:38.690> try

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
of warp on this head and we're gonna try

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.380 
of warp on this head and we're gonna try
and<00:00:38.930> straighten<00:00:39.199> it<00:00:39.379> out<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:40.460> do<00:00:40.609> that<00:00:40.850> we<00:00:41.179> have

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
and straighten it out to do that we have

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.299 
and straighten it out to do that we have
the<00:00:41.600> head<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.230> oven<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.920> we're<00:00:43.160> going<00:00:43.280> to

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
the head in the oven and we're going to

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.639 
the head in the oven and we're going to
be<00:00:43.399> placing<00:00:43.850> a<00:00:43.910> bar<00:00:44.120> across<00:00:44.359> here<00:00:44.719> we're<00:00:45.559> gonna

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
be placing a bar across here we're gonna

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.200 
be placing a bar across here we're gonna
heat<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:45.980> head<00:00:46.129> up<00:00:46.280> for<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.579> specified<00:00:47.120> amount

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
heat the head up for a specified amount

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.079 
heat the head up for a specified amount
of<00:00:47.480> time<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.429> we're<00:00:49.429> gonna<00:00:49.609> let<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.879> thing<00:00:50.059> go

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
of time and we're gonna let the thing go

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.450 
of time and we're gonna let the thing go
through<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.570> cycle<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.410> let<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:51.920> set<00:00:52.219> till

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
through a cycle then we let it set till

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.610 
through a cycle then we let it set till
it<00:00:52.579> cools<00:00:52.789> down<00:00:52.969> and<00:00:53.960> what<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.230> should<00:00:54.440> have

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
it cools down and what we should have

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.290 
it cools down and what we should have
when<00:00:54.739> we<00:00:54.829> get<00:00:54.980> done<00:00:55.190> as<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.429> head<00:00:55.699> that's<00:00:55.969> fairly

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
when we get done as a head that's fairly

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.989 
when we get done as a head that's fairly
loving<00:00:56.890> doing<00:00:57.890> when<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.039> do<00:00:58.160> this<00:00:58.489> I'll<00:00:58.730> get<00:00:58.850> him

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:58.999 
loving doing when I do this I'll get him

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.520 
loving doing when I do this I'll get him
within<00:00:59.149> about<00:00:59.359> three<00:00:59.719> or<00:00:59.780> four<00:00:59.929> thousandths

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
within about three or four thousandths

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.380 
within about three or four thousandths
of<00:01:00.649> being<00:01:00.920> flat<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.030> three<00:01:02.269> or<00:01:02.329> four

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
of being flat and three or four

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.180 
of being flat and three or four
thousands<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.989> take<00:01:03.170> off<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.589> not<00:01:03.769> only<00:01:03.980> that

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
thousands to take off is not only that

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:31.429 
thousands to take off is not only that
much<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:05.630> let's<00:01:06.140> get<00:01:06.409> started

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.109 

what<00:01:32.439> I'm<00:01:32.560> doing<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.250> put<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> bar<00:01:34.090> across

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
what I'm doing is to put a bar across

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.210 
what I'm doing is to put a bar across
here<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.840> can<00:01:35.020> actually<00:01:35.350> clamp<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.829> head<00:01:36.039> in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
here so I can actually clamp the head in

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.570 
here so I can actually clamp the head in
the<00:01:36.310> middle<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.360> as<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.409> head<00:01:38.619> heats<00:01:38.950> up<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
the middle and as the head heats up the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.429 
the middle and as the head heats up the
pressure<00:01:42.580> that's<00:01:43.000> pushing<00:01:43.360> down<00:01:43.899> on<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.229> head

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
pressure that's pushing down on the head

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:55.580 
pressure that's pushing down on the head
will<00:01:44.710> actually<00:01:45.130> pull<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.549> thing<00:01:45.789> straight

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.050 

put<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.619> specific<00:01:56.920> amount<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:57.549> pressure<00:01:57.759> on

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
put a specific amount of pressure on

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:13.860 
put a specific amount of pressure on
here<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:12.370> we'll<00:02:12.580> set<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.940> temperature<00:02:13.239> at<00:02:13.810> a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
here and we'll set the temperature at a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.190 
here and we'll set the temperature at a
specific<00:02:14.319> temperature<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.390> we'll<00:02:16.930> give<00:02:17.080> it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
specific temperature and we'll give it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.860 
specific temperature and we'll give it
about<00:02:17.380> an<00:02:17.470> hour<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.830> half<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> oven<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
about an hour and a half in the oven and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.559 
about an hour and a half in the oven and
when<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.170> come<00:02:20.349> back<00:02:21.090> we'll<00:02:22.090> check<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.480> for

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
when we come back we'll check it for

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:31.020 
when we come back we'll check it for
straightness<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.989> head<00:02:29.170> bakes<00:02:30.030> it'll

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
straightness as the head bakes it'll

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.150 
straightness as the head bakes it'll
rotate<00:02:31.299> so<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> nice<00:02:32.799> even

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
rotate so that we have a nice even

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.960 
rotate so that we have a nice even
heating<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.299> head<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.340> important

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
heating of the head this is important

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.280 
heating of the head this is important
when<00:02:37.090> you're<00:02:37.269> straightening<00:02:37.510> solder<00:02:38.049> heads

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
when you're straightening solder heads

00:02:38.290 --> 00:03:02.860 
when you're straightening solder heads
if<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.250> wanted<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.609> be<00:02:39.760> correct

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.570 

well<00:03:03.870> we've<00:03:04.080> got<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> handout<00:03:04.710> it's<00:03:05.250> been<00:03:05.460> out

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
well we've got the handout it's been out

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.700 
well we've got the handout it's been out
for<00:03:05.730> about<00:03:05.790> two<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.210> half<00:03:06.330> hours<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.530> as

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
for about two and a half hours and as

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.440 
for about two and a half hours and as
you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.580> have<00:03:08.760> no<00:03:08.970> more<00:03:09.120> rock

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you can see we have no more rock

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.530 
you can see we have no more rock
underneath<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.560> straightedge<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.240> we've<00:03:12.360> got

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
underneath the straightedge so we've got

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.630 
underneath the straightedge so we've got
this<00:03:12.690> head<00:03:12.900> ready<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> resurface<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.010> if

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
this head ready to resurface now if

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.590 
this head ready to resurface now if
you'd<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:14.820> more<00:03:15.060> information<00:03:15.210> about
