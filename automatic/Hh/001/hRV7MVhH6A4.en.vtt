hey guys this episode of block by block

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.370 
hey guys this episode of block by block
is<00:00:02.220> all<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.149> assembler<00:00:03.780> which<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.140> kind

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
is all about the assembler which is kind

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.019 
is all about the assembler which is kind
of<00:00:04.470> like<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.680> super<00:00:05.069> advanced<00:00:05.460> version<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
of like a super advanced version of the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.120 
of like a super advanced version of the
deployer<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:07.259> if<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.470> right<00:00:07.680> click<00:00:07.710> it

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
deployer now if you right click it

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.040 
deployer now if you right click it
you'll<00:00:08.849> notice<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.210> has<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.660> bottom

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
you'll notice that has this bottom

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.749 
you'll notice that has this bottom
inventory<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.099> funk<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> thing<00:00:11.610> with

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
inventory and this funk of thing with

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
inventory and this funk of thing with
all<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> arrows<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:13.049> basically<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
all the arrows so basically what this is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.750 
all the arrows so basically what this is
is<00:00:14.750> it's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> deployer<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.680> will<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.130> things

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is it's a deployer that will do things

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
is it's a deployer that will do things
in<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> certain<00:00:18.330> order<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.500> by<00:00:19.619> having<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.070> in

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in a certain order so by having it in

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.170 
in a certain order so by having it in
this<00:00:20.310> order<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.730> means<00:00:20.880> it'll<00:00:21.029> go

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
this order that means it'll go

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120 
this order that means it'll go
cobblestone<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> will<00:00:22.500> deploy<00:00:22.710> piece<00:00:22.949> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
cobblestone then it will deploy piece of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.490 
cobblestone then it will deploy piece of
stone<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> piece<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> dirt<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> then<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
stone then a piece of dirt and then a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.609 
stone then a piece of dirt and then a
piece<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.800> oak<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.939> basically<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> see

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
piece of oak so basically you can see

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
piece of oak so basically you can see
right<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:28.830> there's<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.250> big<00:00:29.550> gray<00:00:30.269> border

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
right now there's this big gray border

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
right now there's this big gray border
around<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> cobble<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.650> press<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> button<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
around the cobble I press the button a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
around the cobble I press the button a
piece<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> Kabul<00:00:33.329> comes<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.559> you'll

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
piece of Kabul comes out and you'll

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.160 
piece of Kabul comes out and you'll
notice<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.700> stone<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> next<00:00:36.840> big

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
notice that the stone is the next big

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.260 
notice that the stone is the next big
gray<00:00:37.710> border<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.489> break<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.910> piece<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
gray border so if I break this piece of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
gray border so if I break this piece of
Kabul<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> places<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> piece<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.649> stone<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
Kabul now it places a piece of stone the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
Kabul now it places a piece of stone the
next<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> dirt<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> next<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.760> oak<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
next is the dirt the next is the oak and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.700 
next is the dirt the next is the oak and
you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.100> starts<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.640> over<00:00:48.710> however

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you can see it starts all over however

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.010 
you can see it starts all over however
there's<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.340> button<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> corner

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
there's this little button in the corner

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
there's this little button in the corner
which<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> click<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> changes<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.520> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
which if you click it changes it to this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
which if you click it changes it to this
mode<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:55.260> has<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:55.980> colors<00:00:56.219> now

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
mode which has all of these colors now

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
mode which has all of these colors now
these<00:00:56.760> colors<00:00:57.210> correspond<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> various

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
these colors correspond to the various

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.610 
these colors correspond to the various
color<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.010> wires<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.789> red<00:00:59.940> power<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
color of wires and red power so if it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
color of wires and red power so if it
receives<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.489> white<00:01:03.090> signal<00:01:03.600> put<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.110> piece<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
receives a white signal put out piece of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
receives a white signal put out piece of
Kabul<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> receives<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.880> orange<00:01:06.119> signal

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
Kabul if it receives an orange signal

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
Kabul if it receives an orange signal
pilot<00:01:06.869> piece<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> stone<00:01:07.549> magenta<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.700> be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
pilot piece of stone magenta will be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.920 
pilot piece of stone magenta will be
dirt<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.380> light<00:01:11.010> cyan<00:01:11.939> blue<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.570> will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
dirt and the light cyan blue thing will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.510 
dirt and the light cyan blue thing will
be<00:01:13.110> oak<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.650> let's<00:01:13.830> say<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> piece<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
be oak so let's say we want a piece of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.260 
be oak so let's say we want a piece of
dirt<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.090> jump<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> magenta<00:01:15.990> plate<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
dirt just jump on the magenta plate and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.929 
dirt just jump on the magenta plate and
voila<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.689> placed<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.020> piece<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.200> dirt<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.939> let's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
voila it placed a piece of dirt or let's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.170 
voila it placed a piece of dirt or let's
say<00:01:21.439> there<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.369> stone<00:01:23.790> let's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
say there we go we got some stone let's

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
say there we go we got some stone let's
say<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:24.750> oak<00:01:24.960> wood<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
say we want some oak wood there we go so

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
say we want some oak wood there we go so
it<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.119> two<00:01:27.420> different<00:01:27.570> modes<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.110> let<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it has two different modes that let you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
it has two different modes that let you
control<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> places<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> blocks<00:01:30.450> which

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
control how it places the blocks which

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
control how it places the blocks which
makes<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> assembler<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.829> advanced<00:01:32.250> now

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
makes the assembler very advanced now

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
makes the assembler very advanced now
you<00:01:32.610> might<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.970> wondering<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> do

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you might be wondering what can you do

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
you might be wondering what can you do
with<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.729> an<00:01:35.970> automatic

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
with this well here I have an automatic

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.950 
with this well here I have an automatic
wheat<00:01:36.720> farm<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:39.090> uses<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.369> assembler<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.960> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
wheat farm that uses a assembler and a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
wheat farm that uses a assembler and a
block<00:01:43.229> breaker<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.220> works<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
block breaker so the way it works is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.260 
block breaker so the way it works is
that<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.840> block<00:01:46.590> breakers<00:01:47.250> timers<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.060> two

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that the block breakers timers on two

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.580 
that the block breakers timers on two
seconds<00:01:49.100> while<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.299> assemblers<00:01:52.049> time

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
seconds while the assemblers time

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.679 
seconds while the assemblers time
interval<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.340> second<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:53.939> basically<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
interval is one second so basically in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.530 
interval is one second so basically in
the<00:01:55.350> time<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.670> activates<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.360> will

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the time that this activates this will

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.230 
the time that this activates this will
activate<00:01:57.750> top<00:01:58.200> twice<00:01:58.680> which<00:01:59.460> means<00:01:59.490> one<00:02:00.000> time

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
activate top twice which means one time

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
activate top twice which means one time
will<00:02:00.390> activate<00:02:00.869> bone<00:02:01.170> meal<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.770> time<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
will activate bone meal and one time it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.990 
will activate bone meal and one time it
will<00:02:02.219> activate<00:02:02.579> seeds<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.290> here

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
will activate seeds so you can see here

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
will activate seeds so you can see here

if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.640> look<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> chest<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.989> can

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
if you just look in this chest you can

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.790 
if you just look in this chest you can
see

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
see

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.880 
see
that<00:02:13.980> every<00:02:14.370> time<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.290> piece<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.470> wheat<00:02:16.650> gets

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that every time I piece of wheat gets

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.130 
that every time I piece of wheat gets
picked<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.370> some<00:02:18.000> seeds<00:02:18.270> get<00:02:18.510> picked<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
picked up some seeds get picked up and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.300 
picked up some seeds get picked up and
the<00:02:19.920> process<00:02:20.400> continues<00:02:20.450> as<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.310> assembler

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the process continues as the assembler

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.290 
the process continues as the assembler
keeps<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.510> planting<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.430> kind<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:27.030> I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
keeps on planting so it's kind of I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.880 
keeps on planting so it's kind of I
thought<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.720> was<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.140> fitting<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.650> more

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
thought it was kind of fitting do more

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.060 
thought it was kind of fitting do more
advanced<00:02:29.370> farm<00:02:29.610> as<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.870> little<00:02:31.140> compared<00:02:32.010> to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
advanced farm as this little compared to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.410 
advanced farm as this little compared to
this<00:02:32.160> little<00:02:32.370> simple<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.000> did<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
this little simple one we did with the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.410 
this little simple one we did with the
deployer<00:02:33.750> last<00:02:34.080> time<00:02:34.550> just<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:36.000> see

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
deployer last time just so you can see

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.480 
deployer last time just so you can see
the<00:02:36.690> type<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> things<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.800> start<00:02:38.160> doing

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
the type of things you can start doing

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.300 
the type of things you can start doing
with<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> assembly<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> mean<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.530> couple<00:02:41.220> of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
with the assembly I mean a couple of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.790 
with the assembly I mean a couple of
seconds<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.060> about<00:02:42.300> 20<00:02:42.750> pieces<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.290> wheat<00:02:43.530> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
seconds for about 20 pieces of wheat is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.020 
seconds for about 20 pieces of wheat is
not<00:02:44.220> very<00:02:44.730> bad<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.610> hope<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.790> guys
