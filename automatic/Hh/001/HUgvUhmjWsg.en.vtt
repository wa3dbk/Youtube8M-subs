we<00:00:04.500> talked<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.890> earlier<00:00:05.400> when<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> first

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
we talked about earlier when I first

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.839 
we talked about earlier when I first
created<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.710> introduction<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.760> were

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
created the introduction is that we were

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.740 
created the introduction is that we were
going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.059> be<00:00:09.150> discussing<00:00:10.820> getting<00:00:11.820> stuck<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
going to be discussing getting stuck and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.770 
going to be discussing getting stuck and
what<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.769> mean<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.179> most<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
what I mean by that is I think most of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
what I mean by that is I think most of
us<00:00:15.900> no<00:00:16.230> matter<00:00:16.260> how<00:00:16.560> long<00:00:16.800> we've<00:00:17.010> played<00:00:17.310> we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
us no matter how long we've played we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.410 
us no matter how long we've played we
get<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> point<00:00:18.810> where<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.500> play<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.279> song<00:00:21.180> you

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
get to a point where we play a song you

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
get to a point where we play a song you
know<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> start<00:00:21.960> your<00:00:22.109> warm-up<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
over and over again and there are places

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.549 
over and over again and there are places
we<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:33.079> we<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.110> can't<00:00:34.469> get

we<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.360> seems<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:32.690> simple<00:02:32.959> it

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
we you know it seems so simple it

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.110 
we you know it seems so simple it
doesn't<00:02:33.680> seem<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.069> there's<00:02:34.280> any<00:02:34.489> magic<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
doesn't seem like there's any magic to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.570 
doesn't seem like there's any magic to
it<00:02:35.269> but<00:02:35.810> there<00:02:35.959> is<00:02:36.110> because<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.100> don't<00:02:37.280> see

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
it but there is because we don't see

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.550 
it but there is because we don't see
what<00:02:37.760> we're<00:02:37.910> doing<00:02:38.060> we're<00:02:38.810> not<00:02:38.840> able<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
know we do it very automatically at the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
know we do it very automatically at the
mirror<00:02:41.690> gives<00:02:42.019> us<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> reflection<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:43.040> what

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
mirror gives us a reflection of what

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250 
mirror gives us a reflection of what
we're<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.580> doing<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.180> wonderful<00:02:44.569> try
