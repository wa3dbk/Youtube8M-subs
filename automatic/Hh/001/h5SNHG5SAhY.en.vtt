00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that's ok but I lost that which it did

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.800 
that's ok but I lost that which it did
for<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> couple<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> things<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.690> know

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
for a couple of things and then you know

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.690 
for a couple of things and then you know
you<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.110> run<00:02:13.319> for<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you just run for it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.339 
you just run for it
again<00:02:13.849> sometimes<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.569> weird<00:02:14.840> some<00:02:15.140> things

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
again sometimes it's weird some things

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.070 
again sometimes it's weird some things
need<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.680> sort<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.099> things<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.520> sequence

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.290 
need to sort of do things in sequence
before<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.379> next<00:02:18.560> thing<00:02:18.830> we'll<00:02:18.980> install<00:02:19.459> okay

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.190

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
did actually come from Argus so I

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.080 
did actually come from Argus so I
actually<00:04:09.069> thought<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:09.669> gonna<00:04:09.790> end<00:04:10.000> up

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
okay so I did actually think I was going

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.390 
okay so I did actually think I was going
to<00:04:13.750> have<00:04:13.930> another<00:04:14.199> device<00:04:14.590> from<00:04:14.859> Argus<00:04:15.220> it
