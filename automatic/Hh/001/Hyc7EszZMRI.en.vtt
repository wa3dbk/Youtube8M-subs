00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
unfortunately they both look like they

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.210 
unfortunately they both look like they
give<00:02:23.090> me<00:02:23.239> concealer<00:02:23.720> lips<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.349> unless<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.860> mix

them<00:02:25.489> with<00:02:25.730> enough<00:02:26.120> colors<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.680> doesn't

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
them with enough colors it just doesn't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
like enough other colors it doesn't work

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.930 
like enough other colors it doesn't work
for<00:02:30.080> me<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.560> hate<00:02:31.040> doing<00:02:31.250> like

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
for me and I just hate doing like

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.390 
for me and I just hate doing like
layering<00:02:32.360> three<00:02:33.200> or<00:02:33.290> four<00:02:33.470> lipsticks<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.129> to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
layering three or four lipsticks on to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.009 
layering three or four lipsticks on to
get<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> look<00:02:34.819> because<00:02:35.060> then<00:02:35.420> what's<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.810> point

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
get a look because then what's the point

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.170 
get a look because then what's the point
it<00:02:36.230> should<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.560> able<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.920> perform<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.030> look

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
it should be able to perform and look

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.059 
it should be able to perform and look
good<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.450> its<00:02:38.629> own<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.230> I've<00:02:39.319> used<00:02:39.530> both<00:02:39.860> of

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
good on its own so I've used both of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.210 
good on its own so I've used both of
these<00:02:40.599> two<00:02:41.599> times<00:02:41.959> each<00:02:42.440> trying<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> make<00:02:43.069> it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
these two times each trying to make it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.860 
these two times each trying to make it
work<00:02:43.250> but<00:02:43.640> they<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.060> haven't<00:02:44.480> worked<00:02:44.720> out

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
work but they just haven't worked out

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.069 
work but they just haven't worked out
for<00:02:45.140> me<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:46.370> guess<00:02:47.180> these<00:02:47.360> would<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.840> going

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
for me so I guess these would be going

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.750 
for me so I guess these would be going
back<00:02:48.260> if<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.069> about<00:02:49.160> these<00:02:49.519> days

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
back if I was up and about these days

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.630 
back if I was up and about these days
but<00:02:50.180> since<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.959> stuck<00:02:51.110> at<00:02:51.410> home<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.160> don't<00:02:52.579> know

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
but since I'm stuck at home I don't know

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.920 
but since I'm stuck at home I don't know
what<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.849> going<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.120> with<00:02:53.269> these<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.660> they

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
what I'm going to do with these but they

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.150 
what I'm going to do with these but they
just<00:02:54.079> didn't<00:02:54.349> work<00:02:54.470> for<00:02:54.530> me<00:02:54.769> I'm<00:02:55.540> this

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
the color um I think it says a more but

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.220 
the color um I think it says a more but
it's<00:03:10.640> just<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.940> their<00:03:11.120> darkest<00:03:11.629> black<00:03:11.900> and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
it's just like their darkest black and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.199 
it's just like their darkest black and
it<00:03:12.620> actually<00:03:12.769> did<00:03:13.190> work<00:03:13.340> out<00:03:13.579> good<00:03:13.760> my<00:03:13.940> first

it actually did work out good my first

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.479 
it actually did work out good my first
