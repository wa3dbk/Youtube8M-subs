probably really lucky in New Zealand

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.000 
probably really lucky in New Zealand
being<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.270> female<00:02:14.450> jockey<00:02:14.900> because<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.800> get

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
being a female jockey because we get

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.060 
being a female jockey because we get
Chism<00:02:16.220> speech<00:02:16.640> against<00:02:17.480> women<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.830> we've

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
Chism speech against women and we've

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.650 
Chism speech against women and we've
given<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.460> opportunity<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.270> know<00:02:20.390> there's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
given that opportunity you know there's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.050 
given that opportunity you know there's
a<00:02:20.720> lot<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.130> countries<00:02:22.130> where<00:02:22.340> females<00:02:22.880> don't

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
a lot of countries where females don't

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.330 
a lot of countries where females don't
get<00:02:23.240> as<00:02:23.360> much<00:02:23.510> support<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:25.040> believe

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
get as much support but I do believe

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340 
get as much support but I do believe
it's<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:25.880> our<00:02:26.240> females<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.930> New<00:02:27.020> Zealand

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's because our females in New Zealand

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710 
it's because our females in New Zealand
have<00:02:27.440> come<00:02:27.590> through<00:02:27.800> pony<00:02:28.100> clubs<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:29.240> do<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
have come through pony clubs and we do a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
have come through pony clubs and we do a
lot<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.200> writing<00:02:30.560> from<00:02:30.860> an<00:02:30.980> early<00:02:31.250> age<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.400> I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
lot of writing from an early age and I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.310 
lot of writing from an early age and I
guess<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.300> makes<00:02:32.540> us<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:33.020> stronger

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
guess that just makes us a lot stronger

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.980 
guess that just makes us a lot stronger
and<00:02:33.860> probably<00:02:34.580> physically<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.330> mentally<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
and probably physically and mentally so

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.450 
and probably physically and mentally so
we<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.260> get<00:02:36.380> out<00:02:36.560> there<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:36.980> understand

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
we can get out there and we understand

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.490 
we can get out there and we understand
the<00:02:37.580> horse<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.330> know<00:02:38.780> how<00:02:38.960> horse<00:02:39.230> works

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
the horse and and know how horse works

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.560 
the horse and and know how horse works
and<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.520> goes<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.730> long<00:02:41.000> way<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.390> not

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
and and that goes a long way it's not

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.350 
and and that goes a long way it's not
just<00:02:41.870> your<00:02:42.400> ability<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.580> ride<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> horse<00:02:44.180> I

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
just your ability to ride a horse I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.910 
just your ability to ride a horse I
think<00:02:44.570> that's<00:02:44.720> your<00:02:44.870> ability<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.380> understand

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
think that's your ability to understand

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.060 
think that's your ability to understand
a<00:02:46.040> horse<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.430> well<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.260> way<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
a horse as well and in that way it's a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.830 
a horse as well and in that way it's a
lot<00:02:49.220> easier<00:02:49.250> for<00:02:49.580> females<00:02:50.120> we're<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> lot<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
lot easier for females we're a lot and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.770 
lot easier for females we're a lot and
smaller<00:02:51.410> bones<00:02:52.010> lighter<00:02:52.760> generally<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.630> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
smaller bones lighter generally and a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.170 
smaller bones lighter generally and a
net<00:02:54.320> way<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.530> makes<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.950> lot<00:02:55.070> easier<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
net way it makes it a lot easier you

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.470 
net way it makes it a lot easier you
