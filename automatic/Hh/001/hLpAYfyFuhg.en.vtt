00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.780
 Y 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.299
 when redesigning the website the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.719
 governing body took into account that 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.840
 for many people this page is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 our business card 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 we wanted to make changes to the page 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.070
 especially because we wanted to take the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 good news of the kingdom to the greatest number 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.289
 of possible people 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.410
 Our organization is global 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.960
 we preach everywhere and if they arise 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 questions on your own phone do you have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.800
 the answers 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 this is still the internet site 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.090
 has helped me to be a better teacher of the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160
 Bible 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.710
 now I am able to preach to the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.430
 University students does not matter 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.430
 what language do you speak 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.940
 you can use at any time your 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.469
 phone or your tablet to find 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 information on the topic that most 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.100
 interest 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.650
 milestone that I am a taxi driver and I use the site jw 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.230
 to tell them about the bible 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.900
 many young passengers have 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.150
 phones with internet and when I give them 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.780
 the address of the page is looking for 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.670
 I usually have good 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 conversations with them about our 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.890
 most recent magazines when I tell them 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.330
 that can be downloaded they do it in 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.000
 the moment 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.230
 I wanted to show the video of the children that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.780
 they beat others because it 's very good 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.040
 I wrote it down on a paper to my teacher and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 said maybe we can see it I decided 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.450
 show the class this video because 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.690
 is a problem that affects them 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.000
 all the guys without and then that the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.250
 qr code is very useful to present the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.650
 page that can take a picture of 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.020
 code and immediately access 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.900
 information in your language is a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.110
 wonder 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.420
 I often go to work in the subway 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.630
 sometimes he preached to whom I have next 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.550
 using the website with the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.100
 website I enjoy more of the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.420
 preaching because I feel more comfortable 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.420
 when talking to people 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.560
 sometimes seeing what's on the page 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.659
 find something interesting for a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.049
 student or revisit and I send him the 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.049
 link 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.090
 and we wanted it to be attractive and easy 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.879
 of using that people could 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.180
 find out who we are that we believe and 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.069
 How to get in touch with us 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.019
 for years he had been going to church 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.720
 but I did not find answers to my 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.470
 questions why I decided to investigate in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.980
 internet and I stumbled upon jw point or heretic 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.670
 It was like breathing the fresh air 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.019
 explanations were very simple I already 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.200
 I am 78 years old and of course I did not think 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.709
 I could use the page I thought that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.780
 it was for the youth my granddaughters 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.030
 they helped to use it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.099
 I can listen to the publications or 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.150
 increase the size of the letter to 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.150
 can read them 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.870
 now that we see what has been achieved with 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
 this web page we have to recognize 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.940
 that has been more than we had 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.940
 imagined 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.020
 This website is a powerful 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.770
 tool is a gift from jehovah but 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.770
 my question is what are you using 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.770
 fully
