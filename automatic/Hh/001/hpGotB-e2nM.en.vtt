at the airports there as well and then
by<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> time<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> Monday<00:01:33.540> evening

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
by the time we get to the Monday evening

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
commute we'll continue to see the snow

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880

wrapping<00:01:36.180> around<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.780> low<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.140> Boston<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890

Down<00:01:38.490> East<00:01:38.520> Maine<00:01:38.880> before<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> pushes<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.439> out

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
Down East Maine before it pushes on out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880 
Down East Maine before it pushes on out
to<00:01:41.460> sea<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to sea so this is probably going to be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
to sea so this is probably going to be
the<00:01:44.040> largest<00:01:44.430> winter<00:01:45.090> storm<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.439> season

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the largest winter storm of the season

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740 
the largest winter storm of the season
and<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> impact
