00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:47.720

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.189
 Of course that's better if you do that 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.409

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.209
 Now the pieces I finished 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.209
 Just cut a spin 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.900

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.019
 So now I have made the cap 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.769
 that will come over here a bit 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.970
 it can not go wrong here that we do not 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.970

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.980

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.810

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.599

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.790
 I have no food coloring now 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.710
 I do not want to use either 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.750

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:56.229
