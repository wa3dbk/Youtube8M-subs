generation<00:00:21.769> drone<00:00:23.029> with<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> VR<00:00:24.390> capabilities

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
generation drone with a VR capabilities

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.200 
generation drone with a VR capabilities
so<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.430> streams<00:00:26.730> live<00:00:26.970> footage

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so with this one it streams live footage

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.560 
so with this one it streams live footage
to<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> Google<00:00:29.250> VR<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> simply

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
VR and it's streamed live to the actual

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
VR and it's streamed live to the actual
phone<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.460> splices<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> footage<00:00:39.719> into<00:00:39.930> two

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
phone and splices the footage into two
screens<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> put<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> onto<00:00:41.730> your

up it's very simple you make you make it
out<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> cardboard<00:01:13.729> really<00:01:14.729> bizarre<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.240> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
out of cardboard really bizarre but it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.850 
out of cardboard really bizarre but it's
good<00:01:16.189> that's<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.640> cool<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.619> like<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.410 

reason<00:01:22.860> we've<00:01:22.979> made<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.820> until

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
reason we've made this is because until

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.170 
reason we've made this is because until
now<00:01:24.479> fpv<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> major<00:01:26.009> trend<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.640> big<00:01:26.820> drones

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
now fpv is a major trend for big drones

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.929 
now fpv is a major trend for big drones
but<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.619> quite<00:01:28.770> expensive<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.549> cheapest

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
but it's quite expensive so the cheapest

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
but it's quite expensive so the cheapest
sort<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> fpv<00:01:30.509> kits<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> need<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> transmitter

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
sort of fpv kits you need a transmitter

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
sort of fpv kits you need a transmitter
a<00:01:31.710> receiver<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.790> screen<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:34.020> basic

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
a receiver and a screen and that's basic

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.910 
a receiver and a screen and that's basic
kit<00:01:34.860> could<00:01:35.280> cost<00:01:35.430> about<00:01:35.549> 150<00:01:36.540> pounds<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.740> what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
kit could cost about 150 pounds so what

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
kit could cost about 150 pounds so what
we<00:01:38.040> did<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> designed<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.970> module<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
we did we designed a module which is

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.200 
we did we designed a module which is
streams<00:01:40.200> via<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.799> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> module

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
streams via a lot Wi-Fi and that module

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.389 
streams via a lot Wi-Fi and that module
can<00:01:42.899> stream<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> iPhone<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.220> walk

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
can stream to the iPhone because we walk

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
can stream to the iPhone because we walk
around<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> best<00:01:45.060> screen<00:01:45.450> our<00:01:45.630> pocket

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
around with the best screen our pocket

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.100 
around with the best screen our pocket
with<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.110> iPhone<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> fpv<00:01:48.420> goggles

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
with the iPhone and with the fpv goggles

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
with the iPhone and with the fpv goggles
with<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.130> Google<00:01:50.310> VI<00:01:50.549> simply<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.149> them

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with this Google VI simply make them

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
with this Google VI simply make them
free<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.560> simply<00:01:52.710> just

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
free so now you can just simply just

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
free so now you can just simply just
clip<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> drone<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.390> you're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
clip on to the drone and then you're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.609 
clip on to the drone and then you're
streaming<00:01:55.170> live<00:01:55.350> while<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.920> flying

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
streaming live while you're flying

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
streaming live while you're flying
there's<00:01:58.619> three<00:01:58.829> different<00:01:58.979> sizes<00:01:59.420> 640

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
there's three different sizes 640

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.050 
there's three different sizes 640
resolution<00:02:00.680> 720<00:02:01.680> HD<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.759> 1080<00:02:03.180> HD

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.420 
resolution 720 HD and a 1080 HD
here's<00:02:05.060> an<00:02:05.150> footage<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.660> Abdi<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.710> HD

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
here's an footage of the Abdi of the HD

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.330 
here's an footage of the Abdi of the HD
that<00:02:08.420> was<00:02:08.570> flying<00:02:08.810> over<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.380> Toy<00:02:09.650> Fair<00:02:09.710> a<00:02:10.130> few

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
that was flying over the Toy Fair a few

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.940 
that was flying over the Toy Fair a few
moments<00:02:10.640> ago<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.150> at<00:02:11.300> CES<00:02:11.750> right<00:02:12.410> Wow

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
moments ago this is at CES right Wow

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.660 
moments ago this is at CES right Wow
here<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:13.370> go

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
here we go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.300 
here we go
so<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.690> over<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.990> hall<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.590> few

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
so this is that just over the hall a few

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.030 
so this is that just over the hall a few
minutes<00:02:16.580> ago

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
minutes ago

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.390 
minutes ago
it's<00:02:19.040> crystal-clear<00:02:19.760> footage<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:22.190> can<00:02:22.340> you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
it's crystal-clear footage so can you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.470 
it's crystal-clear footage so can you
actually<00:02:22.550> move<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.030> camera<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.600> well<00:02:24.790> yes<00:02:25.790> so

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
actually move the camera as well yes so

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.980 
actually move the camera as well yes so
now<00:02:27.280> for<00:02:28.280> Toy<00:02:28.460> Fair<00:02:28.510> we've<00:02:29.510> launched<00:02:29.840> this

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
now for Toy Fair we've launched this

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.860 
now for Toy Fair we've launched this
brand<00:02:30.470> new<00:02:30.710> micro<00:02:31.400> gimbal<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.450> micro

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
brand new micro gimbal so this micro

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 
brand new micro gimbal so this micro
gimbal<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.230> uses<00:02:33.590> two<00:02:33.860> servos<00:02:34.340> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
gimbal that uses two servos to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.970 
gimbal that uses two servos to
intelligently<00:02:35.780> stabilize<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> footage

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
intelligently stabilize the footage

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.080 
intelligently stabilize the footage
while<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:37.610> flying

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
while you're flying

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.970 
while you're flying
so<00:02:38.390> as<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.780> drone<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.230> moving<00:02:39.530> forward<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so as the drone is moving forward and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.400 
so as the drone is moving forward and
backwards<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.790> camera<00:02:41.240> is<00:02:41.390> stabilized<00:02:41.900> with

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
backwards the camera is stabilized with

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.870 
backwards the camera is stabilized with
this<00:02:42.560> micro<00:02:42.950> gimbal<00:02:43.250> which<00:02:43.340> sits<00:02:43.610> between<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
this micro gimbal which sits between the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.450 
this micro gimbal which sits between the
module<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> drone<00:02:44.780> Wow<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.370> have

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
module and the drone Wow because I have

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.870 
module and the drone Wow because I have
actually<00:02:46.730> been<00:02:46.820> looking<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.870> large<00:02:48.470> drum<00:02:48.920> for

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
actually been looking a large drum for

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.270 
actually been looking a large drum for
filming<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:50.360> very<00:02:51.320> very<00:02:51.620> expensive<00:02:51.950> what's

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
filming and very very expensive what's

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.680 
filming and very very expensive what's
the<00:02:52.370> retail<00:02:52.700> price<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.000> one<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.120> these<00:02:53.240> only

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the retail price on one of these only

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.290 
the retail price on one of these only
$79.99<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.400> one<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.820> looking<00:02:56.090> at<00:02:56.180> was

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
$79.99 the one I was looking at was

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.660 
$79.99 the one I was looking at was
close<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> thousand<00:02:57.260> pounds<00:02:57.530> actly<00:02:57.740> with<00:02:58.640> a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
close to a thousand pounds actly with a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.860 
close to a thousand pounds actly with a
camera<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.510> takes<00:02:59.660> 1080<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.970> yeah<00:03:02.180> big<00:03:02.600> big

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
camera that takes 1080 so yeah big big

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.470 
camera that takes 1080 so yeah big big
difference<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.590> price<00:03:04.270> yeah<00:03:05.270> can<00:03:05.450> you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
difference there in price yeah can you

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.330 
difference there in price yeah can you
give<00:03:05.630> us<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.780> quick<00:03:06.260> flying<00:03:06.740> demonstration

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
give us a quick flying demonstration

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.510 
give us a quick flying demonstration
shot<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.300> 3.0<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.200> then<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.860> have<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.280> lot

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
shot so the 3.0 is is then we have a lot

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.060 
shot so the 3.0 is is then we have a lot
more<00:03:10.550> inertial<00:03:11.209> sensors<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.870> stabilize<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.560> so

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
more inertial sensors to stabilize it so

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.400 
more inertial sensors to stabilize it so
when<00:03:13.220> you're<00:03:13.310> flying<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:14.000> doesn't<00:03:14.360> just<00:03:14.600> move

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
when you're flying it doesn't just move

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.590 
when you're flying it doesn't just move
off<00:03:15.620> any<00:03:15.830> angle<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.550> always<00:03:16.670> stabilizes<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
off any angle it always stabilizes it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.660 
off any angle it always stabilizes it
and<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.930> perfectly<00:03:18.260> balanced<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.190> power<00:03:19.519> it

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
and it's perfectly balanced so power it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.340 
and it's perfectly balanced so power it
up<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.000> you're<00:03:20.750> hovering

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
up and you're hovering

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.080 
up and you're hovering
go<00:03:21.769> forward<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.190> backwards<00:03:23.560> turn<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.970> give<00:03:25.970> me

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
go forward and backwards turn it give me

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.110 
go forward and backwards turn it give me
a<00:03:26.120> new<00:03:26.269> haircut<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.019> go<00:03:27.700> 45<00:03:28.700> miles<00:03:28.970> an

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
a new haircut and if you go 45 miles an

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.860 
a new haircut and if you go 45 miles an
hour<00:03:29.239> in<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.019> straight<00:03:30.320> line

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.949 

easy<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.680> control<00:03:38.360> super<00:03:39.360> easy<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.810> much

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
easy to control super easy it's much

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.690 
easy to control super easy it's much
more<00:03:40.200> much<00:03:40.709> more<00:03:40.860> easier<00:03:41.160> than<00:03:41.310> previous

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
more much more easier than previous

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.820 
more much more easier than previous
helicopters<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.569> drones<00:03:42.870> because<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
helicopters of drones because the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.900 
helicopters of drones because the
sensors<00:03:44.190> were<00:03:44.310> using<00:03:45.020> any<00:03:46.020> plans<00:03:46.319> for<00:03:46.500> EM

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
sensors were using any plans for EM

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.160 
sensors were using any plans for EM
because<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> camera<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.599> drone<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.140> I

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
because the camera that the drone that I

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.890 
because the camera that the drone that I
was<00:03:49.319> looking<00:03:49.530> at<00:03:49.620> how<00:03:49.709> GPS<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.060> whenever<00:03:51.660> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
was looking at how GPS so whenever it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.449 
was looking at how GPS so whenever it
took<00:03:52.050> off<00:03:52.170> safety<00:03:52.440> remote<00:03:52.920> control<00:03:53.220> run<00:03:53.340> out

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
took off safety remote control run out

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.920 
took off safety remote control run out
of<00:03:53.489> battery<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.360> would<00:03:54.480> actually<00:03:54.599> come<00:03:54.900> back

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
of battery it would actually come back

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.660 
of battery it would actually come back
to<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.349> point<00:03:55.470> where<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.890> died<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.489> it

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
to the point where it's died and it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.479 
to the point where it's died and it
would<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.060> would<00:03:57.239> practically<00:03:57.810> land<00:03:58.110> itself

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
would it would practically land itself

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.440 
would it would practically land itself
and<00:03:59.489> he<00:03:59.580> plans<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.940> add<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.180> kind<00:04:00.360> of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
and he plans to add that kind of

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.699 
and he plans to add that kind of
technology<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> we<00:04:01.319> were<00:04:01.410> actually<00:04:01.620> going

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
technology to it we were actually going

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.140 
technology to it we were actually going
to<00:04:01.769> think<00:04:02.069> going<00:04:02.489> down<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> line<00:04:02.940> but

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
to think going down the line but

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.949 
to think going down the line but
actually<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.690> very<00:04:03.810> expensive

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
actually it's a very expensive

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.660 
actually it's a very expensive
technology<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:04.950> wanted<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.489> be

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
technology so we wanted it to be

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.400 
technology so we wanted it to be
Sentinel<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.599> nine<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:06.870> wanted<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> be

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
Sentinel at a nine we wanted it to be

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.070 
Sentinel at a nine we wanted it to be
and<00:04:07.680> we<00:04:08.040> didn't<00:04:08.250> need<00:04:08.459> GPS<00:04:08.730> at<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.239> time<00:04:09.630> for

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
and we didn't need GPS at that time for

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.170 
and we didn't need GPS at that time for
this<00:04:10.140> kind<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.470> entry-level<00:04:11.010> throne<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:12.000> want

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
this kind of entry-level throne we want

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.580 
this kind of entry-level throne we want
this<00:04:12.299> drone<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.630> be<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> simple<00:04:13.170> out<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.410> out<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
this drone to be a simple out of out of

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.620 
this drone to be a simple out of out of
box<00:04:13.890> experience<00:04:14.010> which<00:04:14.549> just<00:04:14.730> flies<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.360> is

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
box experience which just flies and is

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.479 
box experience which just flies and is
easy<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.900> use<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.769> can<00:04:16.889> step<00:04:17.220> up<00:04:17.310> to

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
easy to use and then you can step up to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.400 
easy to use and then you can step up to
it<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.700> could<00:04:17.880> big<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.329> drone<00:04:18.660> right<00:04:19.079> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
it I could big up drone right and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.900 
it I could big up drone right and
following<00:04:19.889> once<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.340> got<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.519> hang<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:20.760> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
micro drone right and another cool

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.250 
micro drone right and another cool
feature<00:04:23.580> about<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.940> 3.0<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.169> can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
feature about the 3.0 is that you can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.469 
feature about the 3.0 is that you can
fly<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> iPhone<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.970> the

the handset at that price yes well

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.580 
the handset at that price yes well
that's<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.630> really<00:04:45.840> good<00:04:45.960> price<00:04:46.140> actually<00:04:46.380> I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
that's a really good price actually I

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.469 
that's a really good price actually I
think<00:04:46.680> he's<00:04:46.890> probably<00:04:47.400> good<00:04:47.970> you're<00:04:48.210> gonna<00:04:48.300> be

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
think he's probably good you're gonna be

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.840 
think he's probably good you're gonna be
better<00:04:48.600> actually<00:04:49.370> buying<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.520> as<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.640> package

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
better actually buying it as a package

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.120 
better actually buying it as a package
in<00:04:51.090> user<00:04:51.270> Nansen<00:04:51.780> rather<00:04:52.710> than<00:04:52.890> your<00:04:53.010> phone

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
in user Nansen rather than your phone

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.430 
in user Nansen rather than your phone
because<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.669> know<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.390> and<00:04:54.870> if<00:04:54.990> Apple<00:04:55.350> are

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
because I know that and if Apple are

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.840 
because I know that and if Apple are
watching<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:55.830> iPhone<00:04:56.310> batteries<00:04:56.700> don't

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
watching this iPhone batteries don't

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.810 
watching this iPhone batteries don't
last<00:04:56.970> very<00:04:57.240> long<00:04:57.919> he<00:04:58.919> does<00:04:59.070> have<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.430> console

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
last very long he does have it console

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.570 
last very long he does have it console
charge<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.770> one<00:05:01.950> thing<00:05:02.160> they<00:05:02.310> need

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
charge you think the one thing they need

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.279 
charge you think the one thing they need
to<00:05:02.760> improve<00:05:02.910> on<00:05:03.240> mobile<00:05:03.570> phones<00:05:03.810> especially

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
to improve on mobile phones especially

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.200 
to improve on mobile phones especially
this<00:05:04.740> type<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.010> technology<00:05:05.370> coming<00:05:05.850> out<00:05:06.000> but

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
this type of technology coming out but

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.270 
this type of technology coming out but
um<00:05:06.539> yeah<00:05:07.139> fantastic<00:05:07.680> looks<00:05:07.830> like<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.010> great

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
um yeah fantastic looks like a great

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.490 
um yeah fantastic looks like a great
level<00:05:08.669> entry<00:05:08.970> drawn<00:05:09.690> copters<00:05:10.050> we're<00:05:10.260> trying

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
level entry drawn copters we're trying

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.379 
level entry drawn copters we're trying
out<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.979> reason<00:05:11.250> we<00:05:11.340> chose<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.880> multiple

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
out the reason we chose that multiple

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.120 
out the reason we chose that multiple
platforms<00:05:12.930> because<00:05:13.289> a<00:05:13.470> lot<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.800> people<00:05:13.979> like

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
platforms because a lot of people like

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.820 
platforms because a lot of people like
flying<00:05:14.490> with<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.180> proper<00:05:15.510> handset<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.200> but

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
flying with a proper handset and but

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.620 
flying with a proper handset and but
also<00:05:16.950> people<00:05:17.340> like<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.760> have<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.270> quirkiness

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
also people like to have the quirkiness

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.810 
also people like to have the quirkiness
of<00:05:18.810> flying<00:05:19.050> with<00:05:19.169> an<00:05:19.229> iPhone<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
of flying with an iPhone so the

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.279 
of flying with an iPhone so the
disadvantage<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.570> blowing<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.900> iPhone<00:05:22.139> it's

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
disadvantage of blowing the iPhone it's

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.810 
disadvantage of blowing the iPhone it's
arranged<00:05:22.710> because<00:05:22.860> you<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.190> 20<00:05:23.490> meter<00:05:23.639> range

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
arranged because you have 20 meter range

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.879 
arranged because you have 20 meter range
but<00:05:24.450> with<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.690> 2.4<00:05:25.200> gigahertz<00:05:25.380> controller

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
but with the 2.4 gigahertz controller

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.129 
but with the 2.4 gigahertz controller
you<00:05:26.130> get<00:05:26.250> 120<00:05:26.760> meter<00:05:27.120> range<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.810> having<00:05:27.990> those

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
you get 120 meter range so having those

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.900 
you get 120 meter range so having those
options<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.590> can<00:05:28.740> pick<00:05:28.919> up<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.100> iPhone<00:05:29.400> fly

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
options you can pick up the iPhone fly

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.469 
options you can pick up the iPhone fly
it<00:05:29.970> around

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
it around

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.330 
it around
hand<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:30.930> around<00:05:31.139> using<00:05:31.410> gestures<00:05:31.979> and<00:05:32.160> tilt

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
hand it around using gestures and tilt

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.620
