00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.900
 for the first time in cameroon and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.969
 in the central africa subregion 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 the leading bolloré group of solutions 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 custom logistics deploys a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.279
 innovative and clean technology for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.050
 develop transport and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.019
 collective services from 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.789
 solar energy at the university of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 yaoundé since May 2014 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.769
 2 blue bus clean silent and no 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 pollutant allow students and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.090
 teachers to get around for free 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.219
 this initiative is not unique since 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.690
 2013 a first bus line 100% 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.550
 electric is operating in hill 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 ivory on the site of the University of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.960
 Boigny houphouet in Abidjan at home 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.480
 I arrive at the entrance of the campus that I 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.059
 go fishing a little bit hurry the point of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 each faculty is found at least at 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.019
 comfortable plaster far apart so here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 when we arrive the electric buses 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 each bus travels 47 people 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.729
 on average which represents 65 thousand 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 passengers transported in the month the blockade 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.390
 has innovative break set on 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.909
 the roof with a power of 30 kilowatts 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.610
 hour for an autonomy of some 150 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.650
 km per day 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 for energy supply a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.850
 space bolloré blue solution equipped with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 photovoltaic panels was erected at 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 within campus so blue solution put 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.160
 at the point a technology unique in the world 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.530
 lmp lithium metal technology 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.300
 polymer that through its applications 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 mobile is stationary respond to 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.340
 major energy challenges of the continent 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.350
 African by storing the energy of the sun 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.180
 inexhaustible and ecological and in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.660
 restoring it at any time of the day 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.940
 like night 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.259
 world leader in electricity storage 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.660
 to the would have deployed so solutions 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.670
 totally innovative is safe for 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.050
 develop clean transport and a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.050
 intelligent energy management
