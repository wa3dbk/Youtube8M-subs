00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
answer that what they then learn they

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.210 
answer that what they then learn they
have<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.629> skill<00:00:53.900> base<00:00:54.140> they<00:00:54.710> learn<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> lot<00:00:55.129> of

have a skill base they learn a lot of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.770 
have a skill base they learn a lot of
people<00:00:55.400> just<00:00:55.430> don't<00:00:55.940> understand<00:00:56.600> it's

people just don't understand it's

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
people just don't understand it's
special<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.230> they're<00:00:57.320> good<00:00:57.500> at<00:00:57.620> it

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
special and they're good at it

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.049 
special and they're good at it
it's<00:00:58.519> just<00:00:58.850> look<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.239> easy<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:04.670> not<00:01:04.820> just

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
it's just look so easy it's not just

it's actually doing that you learning
work<00:01:08.540> beer<00:01:08.900> yeah<00:01:09.490> basically<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.520> get<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
work beer yeah basically I get the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.149 
work beer yeah basically I get the
program<00:01:11.510> seat<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.930> me<00:01:12.050> from<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> teacher<00:01:12.620> and

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
program seat to me from the teacher and

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.000 
program seat to me from the teacher and
then<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.630> could<00:01:14.780> be<00:01:14.870> language<00:01:15.290> written<00:01:15.680> or

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
then it could be language written or

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.830 
then it could be language written or
reading<00:01:16.400> that's<00:01:16.940> our<00:01:17.060> three<00:01:17.240> main<00:01:17.450> ones<00:01:17.600> I

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
reading that's our three main ones I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.530 
reading that's our three main ones I
work<00:01:18.049> with<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.670> I'll<00:01:19.850> get<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.150> program

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
work with and so I'll get the program

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.260 
work with and so I'll get the program
but<00:01:20.690> then<00:01:20.870> I<00:01:20.990> had<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.350> simplify<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.340> suit<00:01:22.850> my

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
but then I had to simplify it to suit my

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.899 
but then I had to simplify it to suit my
level<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.659> children<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.470> child<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.640> work

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
level of children a child that I work

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.730 
level of children a child that I work
mostly<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.299> she<00:01:26.960> could<00:01:27.170> manage<00:01:27.500> in<00:01:27.650> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
mostly with she could manage in the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.039 
mostly with she could manage in the
classroom<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:28.400> some<00:01:29.180> days<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.570> think<00:01:29.840> if<00:01:29.930> she

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
classroom but some days I think if she

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.660 
classroom but some days I think if she
didn't<00:01:30.320> have<00:01:30.439> someone<00:01:30.710> there<00:01:30.979> she<00:01:31.369> would<00:01:31.520> just

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
to the appropriate people and there I

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.140 
to the appropriate people and there I
think<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.380> school<00:03:38.650> libraries<00:03:39.310> have

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
think that that school libraries have

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.620 
think that that school libraries have
really<00:03:40.960> changed<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.920> last<00:03:42.010> few<00:03:42.400> years<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
really changed in the last few years and

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.960 
really changed in the last few years and
I<00:03:43.840> think<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.320> they've<00:03:44.530> attracted<00:03:44.970> more

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
I think that they've attracted more

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.410 
I think that they've attracted more
professional<00:03:47.310> librarians<00:03:48.310> who<00:03:48.490> can<00:03:48.700> see<00:03:49.030> that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
professional librarians who can see that

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.680 
professional librarians who can see that
that<00:03:49.600> this<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.320> very<00:03:50.590> satisfying<00:03:50.830> job<00:03:51.690> and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
that this is a very satisfying job and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.060 
that this is a very satisfying job and
that<00:03:52.959> they<00:03:53.110> can<00:03:53.320> actually<00:03:53.620> make<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.830> real

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that they can actually make a real

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.430 
that they can actually make a real
difference<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.050> hit<00:03:56.170> a
