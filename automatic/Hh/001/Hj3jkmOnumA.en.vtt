00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.490
 me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.660
 I would like to explain the relationship between sensitivity and exposure . 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.680
 Hurry because &amp;, for example ISO 100 method village 200 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:28.090
 It is very few people are you know the other this mechanism has so say so 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.830
 First of all, let's explain like this 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.830
 Suppose that this was only a bribe 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 The combination of the time of doing small chopsticks this combination 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.660
 It is translation, but this combination is this winter 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.660
 The fact that it was not it was 200 I of Isomaru 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.520
 It would be nice to think 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.000
 Because there is one step of this card when it becomes a hotel of a rose 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.670
 Because it is Twitter 200 the contents of the ISO 100 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.629
 The combination changes in the case of 200. This is the case in 200. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.629
 Fouling in this position 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 In other words , this combination of 100 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 It is a combination vogue magazine 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 Also 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.180
 When the hurry in this is I hurry executives and door this made do is say whether the bottom if 100 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.050
 400 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.230
 It this is the case of You're lying 400 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.230
 to place 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.870
 It becomes like this , that is two stages 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 By increasing the ISO sensitivity throttle is throttled 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.200
 Let's be able to say that you can squeeze a quick shutter speed and aperture 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.700
 is 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.909
 I can do other reports but if you think about the image quality 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 Because there is better not to unnecessarily increase after the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.310
 It is Senpyo season to out rush too high 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 I think that it is good not to shoot 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.789
 However this is to look at that all day photo 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.539
 It is the contents of the photograph to the last 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:14.340
 For example, if this is a pattern that you should shoot with high sensitivity 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.030
 When it seems that it is not good to have a swing with the blue one of Goji shutters 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.760
 Please try to open 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:26.170
 In that case, I am aware that the chairman will be damaged to some extent 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:33.190
 Image of what the real is to reflect and say what is important is because home photo 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:38.200
 Although there is no need to squeeze me that you'll say and take what was do not need too much throttle 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.450
 The fact that there is no need to be able to fast cars it is to increase the sensitivity to not have a fast shutter 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.830
 is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.410
 Photography is always the choice What to stop? 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.090
 Because it means that we make use in photographic expression 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.810
 Say take pictures while envision these things 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.810
 It's water
