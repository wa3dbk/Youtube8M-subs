your team so when that first couple of
Tanks<00:01:58.000> showed<00:01:58.300> themselves<00:01:58.510> maybe<00:01:58.960> pop<00:01:59.260> off<00:01:59.470> a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
you can use them to pillar you need to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.300 
you can use them to pillar you need to
be<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> trough<00:03:10.269> like<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.040> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
be in the trough like this which is the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.550 
be in the trough like this which is the
deeper<00:03:12.610> part<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.540> instead<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.019> going<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
deeper part so instead of going up the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.589 
deeper part so instead of going up the
hill<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:15.549> could<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.819> approached<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.330> like

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
hill we could have approached it like

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.960 
hill we could have approached it like
this<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.290> again<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> area<00:03:18.640> where

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
this and again this was the area where

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.699 
this and again this was the area where
all<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.269> bad<00:03:19.450> guys<00:03:19.690> were<00:03:19.959> you're<00:03:20.200> limiting

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
all the bad guys were you're limiting

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.800 
all the bad guys were you're limiting
your<00:03:20.920> exposure<00:03:21.070> same<00:03:21.760> thing<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.090> before<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
your exposure same thing as before and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.410 
your exposure same thing as before and
just<00:03:23.590> pull<00:03:23.799> up<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:24.130> pillar<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.850> as<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.180> start

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
just pull up and pillar so as you start

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.370 
just pull up and pillar so as you start
taking<00:03:25.540> damage<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.829> simply<00:03:27.280> back<00:03:27.850> off

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
taking damage you can simply back off

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.130 
taking damage you can simply back off
hug<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.680> height<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.910> sand<00:03:31.239> dune<00:03:31.480> because

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
hug the height of this sand dune because

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.509 
hug the height of this sand dune because
that's<00:03:32.290> what's<00:03:32.470> gonna<00:03:32.530> protect<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.130> not

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
that's what's gonna protect you not

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.550 
that's what's gonna protect you not
being<00:03:33.790> too<00:03:34.000> far<00:03:34.269> into<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.870> because<00:03:35.440> if

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
being too far into here because if

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.289 
being too far into here because if
you're<00:03:35.680> too<00:03:35.859> deep<00:03:36.100> into<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:37.060> don't<00:03:37.180> have

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
you're too deep into this you don't have

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.930 
you're too deep into this you don't have
as<00:03:37.630> much<00:03:37.900> protection<00:03:38.579> somebody<00:03:39.579> could<00:03:39.700> lob

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
as much protection somebody could lob

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.340 
as much protection somebody could lob
some<00:03:40.180> shots<00:03:40.390> over<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.079> gotta<00:03:41.230> be<00:03:41.260> careful

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
some shots over so you gotta be careful

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.140 
some shots over so you gotta be careful
there<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.100> it's<00:03:42.220> important<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.940> nice

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
there so it's important to have a nice

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.629 
there so it's important to have a nice
back<00:03:43.389> up<00:03:43.660> into<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.739> higher<00:03:44.950> part<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.430> this

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
back up into the higher part of this

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.120 
back up into the higher part of this
hill<00:03:45.910> or<00:03:46.180> any<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.079> other<00:03:47.440> maps<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:47.920> have

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
hill or any of the other maps that have

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.670 
hill or any of the other maps that have
cliffs<00:03:48.730> or<00:03:49.000> some<00:03:49.510> rocks<00:03:49.750> get<00:03:50.019> close<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.530> those

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
cliffs or some rocks get close to those

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.610 
cliffs or some rocks get close to those
you<00:03:50.980> don't<00:03:51.130> wanna<00:03:51.250> be<00:03:51.340> too<00:03:51.459> far<00:03:51.700> behind<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.750> if

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
you don't wanna be too far behind so if

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.770 
you don't wanna be too far behind so if
we<00:03:53.889> advance<00:03:54.010> we've<00:03:54.790> got<00:03:54.970> all<00:03:55.180> these<00:03:55.329> other

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
we advance we've got all these other

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.809 
we advance we've got all these other
different<00:03:56.230> dunes<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.069> we<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.370> play<00:03:57.579> off<00:03:57.790> of

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
different dunes that we can play off of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.000 
different dunes that we can play off of
same<00:03:58.209> thing<00:03:58.239> here<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:59.530> we<00:03:59.680> got<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> nice

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
same thing here you know we got a nice

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.920 
same thing here you know we got a nice
right<00:04:00.280> side<00:04:00.549> here<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.060> we<00:04:01.209> can<00:04:01.359> simply<00:04:01.720> back

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
right side here and we can simply back

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.080 
right side here and we can simply back
up<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.440> depending<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.639> angle<00:04:04.000> of

up and depending on the angle of

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.180 
up and depending on the angle of
exposure<00:04:04.480> here<00:04:04.959> if<00:04:05.260> somebody<00:04:05.470> has<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.739> lock-on

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
exposure here if somebody has a lock-on

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.430 
exposure here if somebody has a lock-on
weapon<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.299> literally<00:04:07.600> break<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.230> lock

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
weapon you can literally break that lock

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.470 
weapon you can literally break that lock
here<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.400> maybe<00:04:09.609> somebody's<00:04:09.970> locking<00:04:10.299> from

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
here and maybe somebody's locking from

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.840 
here and maybe somebody's locking from
over<00:04:10.690> here<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.350> can<00:04:11.530> pull<00:04:11.709> up<00:04:11.739> again<00:04:12.190> until

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
over here you can pull up again until

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.270 
over here you can pull up again until
your<00:04:13.090> ApS<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.049> up<00:04:14.170> again<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.590> maybe<00:04:14.889> move<00:04:15.250> to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
your ApS is up again and maybe move to

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.670 
your ApS is up again and maybe move to
another<00:04:15.609> spot<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.329> again<00:04:16.690> never<00:04:17.139> if<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.440> see

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
another spot and again never if you see

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.259 
another spot and again never if you see
a<00:04:17.709> bunch<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.070> bad<00:04:18.220> guys<00:04:18.250> right<00:04:18.609> here<00:04:18.820> don't

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
a bunch of bad guys right here don't

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.180 
a bunch of bad guys right here don't
ever<00:04:19.450> do<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.630> because<00:04:19.959> why<00:04:20.200> you're<00:04:20.799> exposing

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
ever do this because why you're exposing

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.100 
ever do this because why you're exposing
your<00:04:21.459> underside<00:04:21.909> and<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.510> don't<00:04:22.690> have<00:04:22.870> down

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
your underside and you don't have down

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.659 
your underside and you don't have down
angle<00:04:23.349> it<00:04:23.650> takes<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:24.039> a<00:04:24.070> second<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:24.580> up

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
angle it takes you a second to get up

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.290 
angle it takes you a second to get up
this<00:04:24.789> hill<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.210> this<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.419> tiny<00:04:25.690> little<00:04:25.930> guy

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
this hill and this is a tiny little guy

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.360 
this hill and this is a tiny little guy
so<00:04:26.870> imagine<00:04:27.110> how<00:04:27.319> bad<00:04:27.590> this<00:04:27.740> could<00:04:27.949> be<00:04:28.129> if

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
so imagine how bad this could be if

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.189 
so imagine how bad this could be if
there's<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:28.789> piece<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.030> armor<00:04:29.300> there<00:04:29.569> you've

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
there's a piece of armor there you've

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.020 
there's a piece of armor there you've
probably<00:04:30.500> already<00:04:30.770> taken<00:04:31.099> a<00:04:31.160> nasty<00:04:31.340> shot<00:04:31.759> it's

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
probably already taken a nasty shot it's

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.730 
probably already taken a nasty shot it's
gonna<00:04:32.210> take<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.449> a<00:04:32.479> while<00:04:32.569> to<00:04:32.629> back<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.110> so

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
gonna take you a while to back up so

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.659 
gonna take you a while to back up so
play<00:04:34.069> these<00:04:34.250> dunes<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.909> Hills<00:04:35.690> appropriately

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
play these dunes and Hills appropriately

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.879 
play these dunes and Hills appropriately
give<00:04:37.669> yourself<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.300> nice<00:04:38.599> little<00:04:38.840> area<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.500> be

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
give yourself a nice little area to be

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.730 
give yourself a nice little area to be
able<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.099> Pillar<00:04:41.110> create<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.199> exposure<00:04:42.530> you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
able to Pillar create the exposure you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.309 
able to Pillar create the exposure you
want<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.280> reduce<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.330> exposure<00:04:44.659> that<00:04:45.259> you

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
want and reduce the exposure that you
