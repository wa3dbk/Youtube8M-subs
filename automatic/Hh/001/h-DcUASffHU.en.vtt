00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 is not to be understood what is currently 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 on the internet, a new iphone is on 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.379
 new scandal band money is called that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 whole and nothing hides behind it 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.570
 other than the stability of the iphone 6 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.219
 namely and the iphone 6 is supposed to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.509
 The part is bent completely 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.609
 easy if you look at it 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.470
 I'm standing here with computer now 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.670
 picture chief editor axel tel sro and we 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 I just want to try that out 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 Can not believe it or I am 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
 put forward that should not be so 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.060
 be feature as well as both volumes picture tv 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.330
 but should actually be the bach 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.599
 so then let it fly to losgelegt 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.599
 to press 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 pretty easy 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 So well in fact, ding 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 They bend quite well but it works 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 even that can be synonymous with that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.750
 evenly offer on others 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.540
 We already have a goal to try 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 from 6 plus he brutal 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.799
 I can net so it can be synonymous to 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 make home if a the beautiful 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.710
 takes and however it goes it works 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 still a climate is a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.770
 withdrawn 11 times try out plan 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770
 to run 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.180
 I almost got that again 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.360
 second-born the other direction though 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.370
 it is broken there but you 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 it's just going to turn right now 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:03.440
 In any case, I will be back 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.160
 a little beagle so it's up 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 every case again 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.720
 I would say it is straight again though 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.270
 since broken so I have to compare 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.060
 here's the note 3 from samsung 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.430
 that has a whole look 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.930
 similar size is even on the sides 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.090
 try a little larger the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.500
 but to weigh whether that is exactly the same 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.180
 easy to bend because the theory 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.590
 is all of us who are so big 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.970
 can therefore be easily 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.500
 but if we turn now 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.500
 bit expanded as a professor 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.770
 has made just blood 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.970
 that's NEN increasing dimensions bit 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.230
 next much more stable than it 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.760
 actually nothing happens in the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.320
 same clear effort except that it 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.660
 blood makes blood look and feel 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.890
 want to turn it almost bends 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.930
 exactly but then goes again 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.940
 back I find it hidden 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 not at all and completely 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.270
 a little bit but not like that now 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.020
 Actually, I'm just looking forward to it 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:15.180
 Violence 60s does not just beat itself again 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.500
 even the cover goes back 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.110
 purely 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.890
 most incredible material weakness 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.780
 Design error therefore it is just aluminum 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.420
 and that you know how to bend that 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.630
 one does not not so now anyway 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.459
 all the time they turn because they are you 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.230
 i want to have it in my pants pocket and 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.090
 put me on it and have to with it 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.910
 I expect the thing that I'm in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.310
 your body iphone is maybe 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.269
 not a good feeling that already quite far 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.860
 no longer than apple 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.930
 I can try it well 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.720
 that's just the people have 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 it is still not to be set on it 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.700
 unbelievable what do we hear that promise 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.440
 at the iphone 6 plus in particular at the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.400
 really big model just special 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 Be careful because otherwise the 799 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.070
 899 999 bent very quickly or even 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.989
 Of course, it's not just about 1 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.390
 grave that the iphone 6 plus yourself 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.220
 Just go through it when you turn one 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.169
 a little more force acts on it 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.060
 but also what happened afterwards 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.530
 Five minutes after watching the video 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.660
 we wanted to have it turned again 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.520
 Turn on and behold, it was broken 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.580
 The display was still on, however 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.380
 nothing was displayed and itunes 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.220
 has an iphone in recovery 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.229
 state recognized 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.729
 that could not even mean anything 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.530
 of course you would do that now 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.820
 can somehow update but if 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.870
 it does not show anything that brings yes 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.120
 not much either 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.010
 is added and that is actually a 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.110
 a pity that samsung that 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.610
 at the note 3 he did what he did 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.310
 much longer already on the market 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.960
 there's nothing like that 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.610
 Of course it is with you if you 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.529
 on it presses but then it goes into the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.209
 original shape 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.189
 back and you have one again 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.959
 plan cell phone which also concerns at the 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.849
 iphone 6 plus does not happen that and 

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.739
 just for the price you would have the in 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.979
 definitely test the design department 

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.979
 can
