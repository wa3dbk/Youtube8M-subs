00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.480
 and that a friends like they have been I am 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.639
 ryder here back with another map more 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.590
 and this time, well, with a map that 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.750
 I think you're going to like it a lot because 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.700
 to me has me happy because this is a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.400
 different map is not a common map 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 because right now they're going to take it out is a map 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.220
 similar to remember this movie of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.590
 avatar I do not know if you remember her in that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 movie had on video more like 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.760
 these 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.030
 can not see saw more truly 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.190
 epics that then all the map 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.460
 it's been like that with those biomes that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.219
 I think they took them out recently I started and 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.649
 well they come being saw more than the truth 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.390
 it's worth playing them here in console 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.300
 for he had brought them no no no 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.489
 map still of that type and well I know 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.680
 that I started there is already an option to do 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.049
 maps like that or generate worlds of this 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.260
 way but good here is the map 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.820
 people that I hope you like a lot 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.979
 It has some challenges but in reality 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.890
 this map does not come exactly 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.950
 to meet them or be a good south map 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.960
 if it comes to be a map of survival but 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.539
 I think more to be more than everything 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 created to play it take or be a 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.729
 new experience and not practically 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 for the challenges that is the same I'm going to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 put in the description but they will see 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 here we have a house with it now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 things that they facilitate us with here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 is the name of the person who 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.240
 converted from icon black crowes and here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.850
 we have a trunk with things like 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.039
 I mentioned that we have provided as 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.240
 this being the three little heads 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.729
 to invoke the leader we have eggs from 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.039
 horses pigs cows of all kinds now 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.689
 we have a mount to be able to mount 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.659
 the horses and what mother names we have 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.429
 when we fall from a time of a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.229
 language of these I'm talking something 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.119
 awkwardly they excuse me but it is that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.179
 well I wanted to make this video because 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.220
 I'm about to leave but before I wanted this one 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.590
 leave a video above or do not want to 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.780
 go away again from partying because I'm from 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.239
 vacation and not uploading anything is why 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.520
 that he had not brought anything to them but it is that 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.220
 well I'm on vacation and I'm 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.380
 enjoying my vacations and sometimes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.960
 I want to record but I get called 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.420
 a friend and let's go new that's going 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.950
 more you want ok but good here is this 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 map that I know you're going to like because 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.950
 I loved very much a map 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.420
 truly good quite original 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.540
 because these biomes I had not 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.550
 brought yet and this map has everything 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.640
 kind of things have languages even 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.980
 of this type of wood that I do not know if it will be 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.920
 but for me yes that wood 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.590
 new that we have brought new doors 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.190
 this some doors 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.190
 as to see I do not know to see I'm in creative 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.040
 and this kind of wood to see 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.890
 Where is 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.140
 I think it is 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.660
 in acacia door bone the wood of 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.060
 this acacia I do not know if it will be this 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.940
 it's not out there, there's the biome 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 but I'm not sure exactly 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.120
 where there are also ice ice biomes 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.850
 with snow it looks a lot like this 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.130
 more the earth so that color here we have 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.750
 the biomes of chambi cows also the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.570
 true the map is complete as 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.400
 you know is converted from pc then the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.610
 map has all kinds of languages 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.130
 then you just have to check it a bit 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.930
 see what else you can find here 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.940
 but the map has all kinds of 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.940
 languages and the best thing is that the whole map 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.120
 it's like this has nothing this 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.000
 it's not flat anywhere, it's all 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.620
 well with floating biomes and that's what 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.270
 I liked this map a lot 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.730
 I hope you also like the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.460
 map over here we have a friend we are going to 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.230
 visit we have an ocelot here that 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.230
 because you can not move from there if you do not 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.450
 kill even there there are like mines because 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.860
 I was seeing around here there are candles that 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.350
 I have not put these torches 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.020
 they were already put here I do not know why 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.180
 to see if he let me go around here that I have not 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.820
 seen that there is here 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.979
 but good the challenges will be in the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.840
 description this without case they want 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.539
 meet although there are ones that are very 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.509
 difficult for example out there I read one 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.009
 which says build a house in each 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.710
 biome that is practically impossible 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.229
 imagine a house in each language but 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.360
 if there is also another that is making bridges 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.000
 of each language that is visiting that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 well that already happens but the house in each 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.229
 language that is a bit silly but 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.970
 good people this is today's map 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.720
 I hope you liked it, you know 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.620
 comment leave your I like that that is 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.259
 important then to continue extracting 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.270
 more maps tomorrow I bring you another map of 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.430
 survival that is also quite 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.130
 Well I hope you like to leave your 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.500
 comments I like if you want it and 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.240
 here we are looking at a biomes map of 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.630
 ice as you can see it 's pretty but 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.669
 it looks really but here if 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.340
 someone wants to build a map of m in 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.620
 survival plan in an adventure mode 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.630
 here you can perfectly do it 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.520
 truly great 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.400
 good people this is all already know 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.060
 Comment on your likes I'm ryder and 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.060
 until next time
