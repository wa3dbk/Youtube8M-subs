00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
caravan as well as being functional

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.840

because it's lighter weight than wood

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.660 
because it's lighter weight than wood
it's<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.720> flexible<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> were<00:02:02.130> able<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it's more flexible so we were able to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.109 
it's more flexible so we were able to
slap<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> sides<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> caravan<00:02:04.530> quickly

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.860 
we weren't that happy with and we're
also<00:03:11.610> about<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.150> move<00:03:12.330> across<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.840> country

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
also about to move across the country

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.620 
also about to move across the country
and<00:03:13.500> we<00:03:13.620> didn't<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.920> where<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.270> decided

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and we didn't know where so we decided

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.440 
and we didn't know where so we decided
that<00:03:15.750> having<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.560> portable<00:03:16.980> housing<00:03:17.670> solution

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that having a portable housing solution

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.580 
that having a portable housing solution
that<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:20.120> made<00:03:21.120> by<00:03:21.300> ourselves<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.170> we<00:03:22.410> could

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
that was made by ourselves so we could

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.740 
that was made by ourselves so we could
decide<00:03:22.860> exactly<00:03:23.070> what<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.730> was<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
decide exactly what it was was the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
decide exactly what it was was the
perfect<00:03:24.990> thing<00:03:25.260> for<00:03:25.290> our<00:03:25.560> lives<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.550> canvas

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
perfect thing for our lives the canvas

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.080 
perfect thing for our lives the canvas
cover<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.450> wagon<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.160> unconventional<00:03:29.160> by

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
cover on the wagon is unconventional by

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.230 
cover on the wagon is unconventional by
modern<00:03:30.540> standards<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.800> conventional

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
modern standards but very conventional

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.260 
modern standards but very conventional
traditionally<00:03:33.860> it's<00:03:34.860> used<00:03:35.160> traditionally<00:03:36.150> on

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
traditionally it's used traditionally on

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.840 
traditionally it's used traditionally on
many<00:03:37.020> of<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.380> covered<00:03:37.890> wagons<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.610> past

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
many of the covered wagons of the past

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.100 
many of the covered wagons of the past
both<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.390> Europe<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.710> Americas<00:03:41.870> we<00:03:42.870> chose

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
both in Europe and the Americas we chose

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.830 
both in Europe and the Americas we chose
it<00:03:43.260> because<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.560> light<00:03:43.740> weight<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.840> it's

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it because it's light weight and it's

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.780 
it because it's light weight and it's
been<00:03:46.020> working<00:03:46.410> very<00:03:46.620> well<00:03:46.710> for<00:03:46.860> us<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.550> a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
been working very well for us it's a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
been working very well for us it's a
treated<00:03:48.150> canvas<00:03:48.600> that's<00:03:49.020> used<00:03:49.260> for<00:03:49.380> sales

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
treated canvas that's used for sales

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.400 
treated canvas that's used for sales
it's<00:03:50.580> called<00:03:50.760> Sun<00:03:51.000> forager<00:03:51.420> canvas<00:03:51.840> mildew

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
it's called Sun forager canvas mildew

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.620 
it's called Sun forager canvas mildew
resistant<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.220> water<00:03:54.030> repellant

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
resistant and water repellant

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690 
resistant and water repellant
oh<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:55.410> worked<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.800> well<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.310> us<00:03:56.370> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
oh it's worked really well for us I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.270 
oh it's worked really well for us I
think<00:03:57.230> what<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.260> really<00:03:58.590> liked<00:03:58.830> about<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
think what I really liked about the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.490 
think what I really liked about the
design<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.610> we<00:03:59.940> ended<00:04:00.210> up<00:04:00.360> with<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.900> that

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
design that we ended up with is that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.190 
design that we ended up with is that
it's<00:04:01.860> really<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:03.270> really<00:04:03.390> easy<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.870> change

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
it's really it's really easy to change

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.890 
it's really it's really easy to change
modify<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.950> change<00:04:05.250> things<00:04:05.720> for<00:04:06.720> whatever

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
modify and change things for whatever

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.730 
modify and change things for whatever
we're<00:04:07.200> using<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.890> at<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.100> time<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.760> that

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
we're using it for at the time and that

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.650 
we're using it for at the time and that
so<00:04:10.740> in<00:04:11.100> some<00:04:11.520> ways<00:04:11.670> we<00:04:11.910> change<00:04:12.180> things<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
so in some ways we change things all the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.030 
so in some ways we change things all the
time

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
time

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.230 
time
but<00:04:14.040> that's<00:04:14.310> kind<00:04:14.520> of<00:04:14.580> built<00:04:14.760> into<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> design

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
but that's kind of built into the design

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.570 
but that's kind of built into the design
so<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:16.020> think<00:04:16.230> what<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.160> served<00:04:17.400> us

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
so I think what we have this served us

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.250 
so I think what we have this served us
really<00:04:17.850> well<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:18.390> we've<00:04:18.720> lived<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
really well you know we've lived in it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.530 
really well you know we've lived in it
we've<00:04:19.470> had<00:04:19.650> friends<00:04:20.130> live<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.850> when<00:04:21.420> you

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
we've had friends live in it when you

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.930 
we've had friends live in it when you
take<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> camping<00:04:22.470> we<00:04:23.100> sometimes<00:04:23.310> we<00:04:23.610> just<00:04:23.790> use

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
take a camping we sometimes we just use

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.000 
take a camping we sometimes we just use
it<00:04:23.970> for<00:04:24.120> outdoor<00:04:24.570> parties<00:04:25.020> set<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.680> up<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.830> a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
it for outdoor parties set it up like a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.310 
it for outdoor parties set it up like a
little<00:04:26.100> lounge<00:04:26.460> area<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.660> really<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:28.080> kind

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
little lounge area so it really is kind

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.520 
little lounge area so it really is kind
of<00:04:28.380> multi-purpose<00:04:28.950> space
