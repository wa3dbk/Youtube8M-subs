a<00:00:06.750> quick<00:00:06.990> look<00:00:07.200> at<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.550> application<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.849> put

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
a quick look at a application I put

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.450 
a quick look at a application I put
together<00:00:09.240> called<00:00:10.050> dynamic<00:00:10.440> background<00:00:11.250> which

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
together called dynamic background which

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.970 
together called dynamic background which
is<00:00:11.700> sort<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.330> branched<00:00:12.719> off<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.230> lock

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980

widgets<00:00:14.400> application<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.299> working<00:00:15.509> on

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
widgets application that I'm working on

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
widgets application that I'm working on
I<00:00:16.080> ran<00:00:16.470> into<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> couple<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.400> things

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I ran into a couple of different things

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.130 
I ran into a couple of different things
with<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> application<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> way

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with that application it's on the way

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.830 
with that application it's on the way
don't<00:00:19.410> worry<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
don't worry about that but in the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.120 
don't worry about that but in the
meantime<00:00:22.020> while<00:00:22.380> I'm<00:00:22.439> developing<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
meantime while I'm developing that I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
meantime while I'm developing that I
thought<00:00:23.400> I'd<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.640> ahead<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.820> release<00:00:24.029> dynamic

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
thought I'd go ahead and release dynamic

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.679 
thought I'd go ahead and release dynamic
background<00:00:25.400> which<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.880> allows<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.539> to
