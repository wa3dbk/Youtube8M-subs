 philippe carver points out that the extension 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.280
 of the tunnels reaches about 4500 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 kilometers that could harbor 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 around 3000 different types of

 China's attack on the US demonstrates 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.210
 that said nuclear offensive would cause 50

 millions of direct victims near the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.500
 50 percent of the population suffer

 cessation 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.490
 of life expectancy and about five thousand 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.380
 hospitals would be destroyed besides a 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.320
 third of the electrical capacity of the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.210
 country would be destroyed and 40% of the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.040
 land used in the production of 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.560
 food would be contaminated by the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 radiation at least 100 million 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.550
 Americans will suffer from famine 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.280

 first attack in order 200 million 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.630
 dead while the survivors 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.850
 they would live in the dark with little food 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.950
 in a similar way and life expectancy
