00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 greetings to all channel friends 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 youtube welcome to this new video 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.859
 today we clean samsung galaxy big prime 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.349
 the Italian version a new smartphone 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:16.230
 samsung market 5 inch display e 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.520
 many small news the first thing 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 jumps to the eye of this great 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.350
 samsung on the display 5 inches 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.019
 however it is a good resolution of 800 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.140
 x 480 pixels therefore slightly higher 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.940
 720p and a good processor fluidity 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 quad core 1.2ghz 1gb of ram and also 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 quite thin light because it weighs 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.410
 156 grams two 8 megapixel cameras e 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.719
 the secondary 5 megapixel that it is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.789
 really little stuff anecdote important 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.340
 of the phone is the price located below 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 the 200 euros from physical stores and under i 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.219
 180 in online stores such as su 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.680
 amazon 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.370
 the fluidity and really one of the points of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 reference 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 despite the price is very low e 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 let's try on the internet how it is 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 involves opening up the republic you see that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.989
 in mobile browsing 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.860
 we have virtually no problems 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.790
 let's look for the desktop card that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 I had already put on a classic badge e 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.960
 let's try web browsing not 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.240
 expect top of the range galaxy s se 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.159
 because it costs practically a third here 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 but some loading problems 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 you see a slightly jerky setting 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.090
 meanwhile they are like on all samsung 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 modern few but do very well a lot 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.180
 better than the competition of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.500
 iphone and watch that for a phone by 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.770
 180 euros 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.990
 here too, the fluidity becomes a post 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 jerky but we remember that republics 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.280
 a fairly heavy site so not 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 let's take too much notice 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 obviously being an android phone a 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.079
 all google applications 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.820
 the fates google plus the maps the music 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.979
 etcetera etc. but obviously if in a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.869
 android phone also has the play store 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 play store that allows us to download 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.680
 virtually all the applications that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.469
 we want from you despite being a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.869
 phone that costs as little as fluidity 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.719
 it almost never fails and we can 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.429
 also download some heavy games 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.140
 because the hardware of this phone is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.980
 good enough to remember a quad core 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.750
 from 1 to regulate 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.680
 nice news from samsung are all 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 settings that have been 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.670
 completely redesigned and see i 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.799
 colors blue orange red green cetera 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.969
 etc. to divide a bit into sections 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.439
 of the telephone 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.629
 the camera as I said before and 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.769
 8 megapixel one the back one 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.560
 5 megapixel front one 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.689
 rear has a good applause autofocus 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.879
 samsung because virtually everyone e 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.790
 all mid-range phones 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.810
 make good the 8 megapixel photos turned 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.519
 good 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 you see a little loupe to load but it is not 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.810
 as real as the 8 megapixels 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.579
 of the iPhone 6 to do it on deejay more 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 bad fonsai costs much much more 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.239
 however the details of this macro do not 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 I'm not bad looking at the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.379
 the definition of the screws is very much 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.060
 high and overall the photos do not come 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.370
 not bad of course like all the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.799
 google smartphone there are maps that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.590
 speed accuracy work well 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.169
 of gps and very very good with a 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.290
 double tap even when we load the 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.419
 maps and we can practically have 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.609
 a fairly accurate view with a 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.199
 double tap zoom in and go back 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.209
 really no particular problems 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.530
 excellent steps forward for the base of 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.030
 range of samsung 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.129
 I haven't been on a phone for a while 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.799
 samsung basic functional range e 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.470
 fast it will be because it is for design 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.379
 squared pointed at certain points 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.599
 reminds me a lot of the galaxy s ii and his 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.979
 incredibility the matter lasts one 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.840
 quiet day 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:41.199
 we don't ask too much about this smartphone 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.359
 samsung is finally coming back to base of 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.430
 range with commitment and with a lot of 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.769
 statehood obviously updates 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.560
 they are guaranteed for a price of 180 euros 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.139
 is more than good is a great smartphone 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.699
 for this value for money 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.560
 really highly recommended 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.439
 I thank you for being still 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.479
 with us and with this big galaxy prime 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.970
 here is perhaps a little too complicated name 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.349
 I will hardly remember you there 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.759
 greeting and thank you see you all 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.759
 in a future video bye bye
