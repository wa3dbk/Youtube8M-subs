00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.660
 jumping is a powerful weapon and women know that the proof is that he 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.660
 is present in the daily life of many of them 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.269
 and betting on the city in the practical distribution 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.179
 elegant with shapely legs the womanly use and abuse of high heels 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.270
 and some of them do not come down from the jump nor to drive because it is the most beloved jump 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.570
 high and steering does not fall very well 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.530
 This is because according to the Brazilian traffic code you drive wearing 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.900
 do not get stuck in the legs the compromise use of the pedals is infringement 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 average and can lead to the loss of four points in the driver's license we 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.559
 we understand that the high heel hinders the senior jeep drivability 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.620
 of the vehicle is disruptive to 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.600
 two pedals 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.280
 of course this is can be applied 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.119
 fine but it's hard to get off the jump 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.259
 look I'm from the area and she confesses it's a little complicated to use the pedals with these 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.439
 are so but even so risk sometimes slippery state accelerator yes 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.920
 it's true that I also pen speed up is the tricky river 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.180
 plus three states d 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.850
 catanoce else 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.860
 1 already leaves home ready do not want to stop to deal with the exit 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.829
 no nothing and I want to see how difficult it is 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.119
 the average agreed with the idea and we invited a transit instructor 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.170
 to explain how assault commits management the higher the greater the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 degree of difficulty and this goes for cars and dead with we can show 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.950
 bertone it is seen that they do not know seduc of the commands looks benfica tv maringÃ¡ 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.400
 make the marches 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.290
 the difficulty of ambush and even 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.890
 same 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 I call the use of the high heel command of category b that is the car 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.280
 It's kind of complicated because I did not get out of the clutch as we 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 also brake what can happen 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.039
 suddenly she can start to brake the car and properly her foot escape and 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.149
 to collide 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.889
 or even discomfort that happens all the time see how well you can 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.779
 Show 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.799
 shoes with a solution 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.050
 or those who have 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.650
 What we call on my part none of this complicates even more 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.569
 is understood and everything that can cause an accident or 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.230
 take your foot off the accelerator and at the same time brake could be that I was a year 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.089
 that the tax falls 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:38.589
 of the ties last then may occur accident also christ plate try to get 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.120
 warm up on the stage always firm 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.319
 and who did not try to make a friendly 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.780
 but then what is the best way forward is to address the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.450
 people 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.680
 on the opposite hand in the table training 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.630
 to stop 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.589
 the balances hampered 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.419
 so it was only as soon as 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.310
 reservations the little ones 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.549
 or with nothing on your legs 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.870
 but also to follow another example, this lawyer prefers to leave the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.330
 selector and adhere to the fashion of security then does not exist 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.099
 many assault on the safe the sudan show 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.029
 force has been required in such cases, sometimes as a precautionary measure. 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.329
 get out of the car 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.400
 a speaker is missing 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 maybe your work is aimed at improving 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.620
 tyranny leaders have caused barefoot cd's first problem is much better than 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.550
 that you endanger your safety and that of other users of the 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.700
 paths
