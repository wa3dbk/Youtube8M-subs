00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.710
 welcome i am francesco graziani for 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:17.400
 you laugh and in this video we will go to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 see the news in the 6.0 without then 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 with the m8 htc has introduced sense 6.0 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.830
 also called sixth sense practically 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 sixth sense would be the new version 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.769
 of the interface that was already present 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.940
 on the old one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.380
 this is an m7 this is an m 8 not yes 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.899
 it's a big revolution 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.520
 rather than an evolution 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 absence has always been an interface 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 very practical and fast and the sixth 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 incarnation is no less a ha 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.989
 acquired even more speed and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 simplicity 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.530
 the first thing we can notice is i 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 screen buttons are no longer on this 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.500
 black bar but high on the screen 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 it is only in transparency with respect to before 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.120
 in fact if you see the doc icons here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 I'm on a transparency 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 here instead the color is solid let's say 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.260
 so the whole is a little more consistent with 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 my guides more than anything of kit kat 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.100
 so that's what we find maybe up 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 a nexus or on phones without buttons 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.610
 physical or touch 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 if we go to see bling feed is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 changed a little bit now it slides by 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.030
 example the old ran in this 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.280
 way with this three-dimensional effect 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 which I personally liked very much was 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.590
 divided divided pages and I find it a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.409
 little bit more comfortable now instead 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.630
 on the sensei there is a single scroll 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.610
 you see vertically that it doesn't stop anymore 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740
 so it never stops more than anything else 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 it is therefore not divided by pages and loses 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
 even those very expensive slices in a 3d 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.430
 as we can see there are in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.979
 transparency icons and function keys 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 green field has been very refined 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.579
 now it is much more complete there 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.659
 many sources to choose from and it is 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.569
 You can also enter personal sources 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.729
 if we look in the tray here in 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.530
 high we had the watch then 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.380
 disappeared going through the various pages 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.500
 now the clock has disappeared and we have 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.030
 a row in almost more already fin 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 from the beginning it is a very good thing 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.549
 because anyway this watch maybe a 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.440
 redundant because we find it on 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.239
 blink feed we have it here if we use it 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.739
 as a widget but from what I've seen it 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.480
 they all use it because a lot too 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.610
 nice and functional to find it too 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.709
 ie in the drawer app would have been a 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.290
 little bit useless actually like 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.629
 first you can choose the grid 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.680
 we see here that grid size is 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.030
 still 3 x 44 x 5 forces could be done 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.160
 a little more space than a nuisance 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.510
 nendo league one but I think anyway 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.730
 that there is enough above all 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.629
 now that we have removed this space 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.849
 here you can customize the order of the 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.739
 things like custom alphabetical or 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.379
 more recent thing than there was before and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.049
 there is search and access to the store 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.250
 one thing that has changed is practically 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.230
 yes we wanted to make a connection 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.780
 first on the home we leave and hold e 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.090
 we had to go on connection and 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.709
 leave the app now 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.750
 fortunately if we take 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.519
 an application we can directly 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.530
 move to the home as it happens then on 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.180
 any other interface 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.069
 another thing that has changed this is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.040
 a novelty in the settings we can 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.459
 choose setting themes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.680
 personalized but and each theme to gods 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.840
 colors you see above that are reflected 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.450
 in some areas for example 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.870
 this one is blue green red and the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.819
 black 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.680
 if we go for example in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.019
 settings as we have seen before 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.900
 color let's say of the highlighting of 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.849
 every setting is green blink feed is 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.500
 green and if we go for example on 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.870
 mail that I still have to configure and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.940
 blue this is something in short that yes 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.560
 reproposes a bit in all applications 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.109
 of htc 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.680
 but what is the turning point are the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.260
 motion lounge practically gestures 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.139
 these gestures that allow you to 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.010
 unlock the phone by activating 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.659
 special functions according to 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 I give you an example I have to put the 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.829
 phone a little vertically is 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.310
 practically if I swipe toward 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.829
 right unlock the phone directly 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.290
 on bring it see I had the phone 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.289
 off then on screen off 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.180
 if I do a swipe to the left 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.609
 I go to the home page then in the first one 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.820
 page if I do it to unlock 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.660
 directly the phone 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.479
 to the application at the last application 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.639
 that he had used if I do it towards 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.889
 the voice dialing opens 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.470
 what attention is not google now is that 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.330
 of htc and if I do a double tap I go 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.030
 to the lock screen and I can start 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.770
 applications in particular let's say in 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.740
 fast way or re-lock the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.150
 phone as if I had unlocked it 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.500
 From the bottom to the top 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.000
 another particular function is a little 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.940
 difficult to show you why it takes 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.690
 a particular angle but I try it is 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.460
 the one you see here it does not work 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.340
 here practically at the touch of a button 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.960
 volume we can open open the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.820
 camera with the phone in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.520
 horizontal does not always work because 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.050
 cellophane and normally works if it is 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.910
 recovering roads is a bit difficult 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.000
 because there is no right inclination for 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.460
 then resume using the camera 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.620
 another very very useful function for 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.389
 some not for all is the function of 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.120
 extreme power saving that we find here 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.340
 under- power saving mode 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.349
 extreme energy that is different from 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.590
 energy saving energy saving 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.270
 reduces the use of the CPU reduces 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.010
 the use of the mini display a little less 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.080
 bright vibrations data connections 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.830
 instead energy saving mode 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.830
 extreme even allows you to arrive 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.810
 at 30 hours of stand by with only 10 per 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.340
 hundred of the battery this is how much 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.380
 declared by htc because practically 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.659
 detach all your phone becomes 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.479
 just a phone that receives and does 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.949
 completely disability phone calls 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.169
 multitasking summed up in a state of 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.689
 really energy saving 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.770
 really extreme as the then says 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:06.110
 first name 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.939
 one last thing worthy of note alone 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.460
 htc applications like the gallery 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.620
 blink fitzroy that are completely 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.779
 disconnected from the firmware this means 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.939
 that there is no need to wait for a 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:19.009
 firmware update to have a 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.719
 update these applications but 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.849
 updates will be downloaded 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.409
 directly from the store this allows 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.020
 ad htc to update much more 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.479
 frequently the applications themselves 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.939
 then we have the biggest news 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.889
 in the interface for the camera and 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.960
 in the gallery they have an interface 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.879
 completely redesigned and many 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.490
 new functions but for that we will do a 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.319
 specific focus these were more or less 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.210
 the novelties of the without of the to see 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.999
 a little related to what was the 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.419
 old sense the 5.5 on the htc one 

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:51.499
 old n7 n8 is behaving 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.710
 really good 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:57.319
 this is one of the first focuses I am 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.449
 by making this phone I apologize for 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.729
 the item which is a little bit low mason 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.439
 influenced but I absolutely had to do 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.009
 this video will soon come others 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.319
 focus 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.729
 then the review by full hello 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.729
 to everyone and to the next video
