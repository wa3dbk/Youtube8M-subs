00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
eight tackles in that particular game I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.070

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.589 
he turned out to be his first year in
San<00:03:43.349> Francisco<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.159> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.120> draw

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
San Francisco so I think you can draw

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.289 
San Francisco so I think you can draw
dial<00:03:45.989> back<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.979> that<00:03:47.579> physicality

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
dial back that that that physicality

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.659 
dial back that that that physicality
maybe<00:03:48.810> when<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.169> not<00:03:49.349> needed<00:03:49.430> rather<00:03:50.430> have

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
maybe when it's not needed rather have

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.490 
maybe when it's not needed rather have
to<00:03:50.819> do<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.150> did<00:03:51.479> the<00:03:51.569> teacher<00:03:51.810> guy<00:03:52.079> had<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.379> be

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
to do that did the teacher guy had to be

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.770 
to do that did the teacher guy had to be
physical<00:03:52.979> I<00:03:53.159> think<00:03:53.639> he<00:03:53.729> did<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.449> season

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
physical I think he did it all season

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.539 
physical I think he did it all season
this<00:03:55.049> year<00:03:55.109> for<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.470> best<00:03:55.709> defense<00:03:56.190> he<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
this year for the best defense he was a

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.539 
this year for the best defense he was a
big<00:03:56.819> reason<00:03:57.030> okay<00:03:57.959> why<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.680> defense<00:03:59.129> was<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
big reason okay why that defense was the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.000 
big reason okay why that defense was the
best<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.909> the<00:03:59.940> country<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.599> again<00:04:01.229> that<00:04:01.799> in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
best in the country and again that in

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.399
