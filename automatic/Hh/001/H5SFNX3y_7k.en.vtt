00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.150
 channel with you still arthur me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.760
 there is such a dilemma as you know 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.710
 the other day comes out in witcher 3 and how are you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.870
 know on the channel will be complete 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.639
 passing this game what are you actually 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.910
 waited a lot and accordingly very 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.859
 asked a lot but I have a dilemma 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 what platform to choose this 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.750
 the game and since so far basically 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.640
 probably will be a little bit better graphics 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 Well, that is, I watched a comparison there 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 playstation 4 against while there and against 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 Xbox is basically the same everywhere on 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 while a little better texture is all in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 principle what I noticed on which 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.219
 the platform will be more interesting for you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 watch this game I decided that you are for 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 decide me exactly what we are going to be 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 pass this game because i know what 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 many interesting to look at the console 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.770
 many interesting versions to look at 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.480
 lush versions so we will spend 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.010
 small vote in the group viz 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 now you will be taken by reference in 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 description and vote for that platform 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 which you would like to actually 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.309
 see this game and I accordingly this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 Platform at the time of release I 'll start 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.409
 it will be a big game 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 interesting and very cool for home and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 passage because because i know 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 on the game it will be really one of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 the main games of the year if not the most important 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.659
 the game is very much it turns out great 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.159
 bulk complex and proper with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 moral choice that you can 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 do u can act out how bad 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 herald so good herald can 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 do anything you can 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 do good deeds therefore 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 actually such things and I really 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 broke my head already in principle after 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.729
 bloodborne and much nicer will 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 play on the gamepad from the smell 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.180
 Well, you go on the gamepad from 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 playstation but it will be interesting 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270
 play it while just for now 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.700
 I think 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.619
 there will be a lot of bugs well, not that much 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.079
 bugs but for now how do you know big 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.299
 open world projects they are always like 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.060
 the rule is a little bit bhagavan and not yet 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.200
 a pair against patches therefore 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.270
 let's decide 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310
 Now we go on to describe ssylochku and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.929
 end of today i'm looking at 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.340
 results no less, respectively 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.959
 we take the version which is more 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.000
 interesting so small 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.530
 interactive user 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.420

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.930
