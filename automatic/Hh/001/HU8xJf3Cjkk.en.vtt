00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.090
 meeting when the sister says dad is

 You can be my boyfriend Albert Gonzalez

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.560
 pepito without my dad taking into account and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.500

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.930
 Devils but your little brother Pepito is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 sleeping down but I was just 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 An idea happens when you want more

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.900
 lettuce and when you want it to wall and 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:00.420

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 to 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.010
 the joke that we just saw him sent 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.350
 a user who calls 88 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.170
