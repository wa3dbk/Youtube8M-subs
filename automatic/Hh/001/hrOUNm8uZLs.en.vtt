00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.260
 the quad company is known for its 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.389
 exceptionally sturdy developments in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 of which were produced for decades and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.080
 it is impossible not to mention 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 electro stats and villages that have become their 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.380
 sort of standard for future development 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 all other manufacturers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 but today we have acoustics of a completely different 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 scale and a completely different price category 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 two-way active acoustics Kuat 9 a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.929
 with is designed to work in composition 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 relatively inexpensive and most importantly 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.550
 compact speaker systems are available in 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 three color options 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 and dimensions make it easy 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 place the acoustics in the office and in 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.219
 home office design 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.039
 model 9 and c is different from most 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 computer acoustics in the abay building 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.190
 speakers placed as a power supply so 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.620
 separate amplifier 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 and in the master column in addition posted yet 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.719
 DAC and switch inputs on the panel 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.910
 controls are located on the power button 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.609
 and volume control and select button 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 source one of the analog inputs 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.720
 placed where on the control panel to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 Itâ€™s convenient to connect a tablet or 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.810
 Smartphone included comes with remote 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 dou 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
 you can control the volume and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 choose sources 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 and more from the amplifier panel and not 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 basic switching required 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.799
 focused behind here we will see the full 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 set of digital inputs and beat up and pubs 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.140
 optical and coaxial further goes 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 paro line inputs line output and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.619
 exit trigger control to second 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.750
 the column is also on the back wall 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.030
 located and output to an external subwoofer 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 interface column on the left is essential 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.670
 easier here besides line input 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.360
 located trigger input and output 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.430
 The 100 mm midbass has 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.770
 Kevlar diffuser at high frequencies 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.619
 running soft dome tweeter diameter 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 25 millimeters for each speaker 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.200
 inside the speaker its own power amplifier 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 65 watts for midbass and 35th for twitter 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 also located inside the enclosure 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.030
 crossovers to adjust the low frequencies 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 there are three flat shield boost presets 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.890
 if the columns are correctly placed then 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.410
 sound stage is beyond praise up 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.150
 clean and neat on the upper middle 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.819
 You may notice excessive voicing 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.800
 typical of kevlar midbass in general 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.050
 we can say that the quality of sound Kuat 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 9a of not inferior to component systems 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.520
 and will suit those who are looking for quality 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.440
 Acoustics in a small case Listen 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.580
 buy kuat 9 and you can in the store
