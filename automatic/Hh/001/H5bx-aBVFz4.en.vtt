00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.970
 manufacturer b proved that we completely mean 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.260
 smartphone race since last week because 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.430
 then you have a blackberry z10 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.840
 introduced 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.330
 and we are going to compare today with the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 apple iphone 5 black are you with yours 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 years through acquisitions might be something 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 longer to come to the z10 and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 her new blackberry 10 o &amp; s 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.820
 actually you are the market we can man 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.440
 from sixty the tour comes by seeming you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.940
 from March in the shops in the Netherlands 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.740
 but this then we are with a zone 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.600
 Landed and Apple iPhone 5 is natural 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.920
 since October 2012 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.930
 apparently hid in the netherlands 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.340
 actually blackberry z10 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.060
 much like an iphone if you like the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.250
 for him 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.110
 do you have the same sleek design he is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 totally touch oil which he does a trick 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.870
 with your them famous iphone button under it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.010
 screen the home button 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 it turns out you're working all the way with 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 touch that comes by blackberry os 10 that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.130
 there citizen budget secure nothing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.480
 that works great but first of all look 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430
 you might notice the build 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.079
 quality difference the apple iphone name 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 is made of aluminum and glass on the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.420
 front 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 where the glass blackberry meets the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 front wall is made and all above one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.160
 plastic the side also in the back 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 the rubber material is what 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.789
 otherwise nice and holds on to it 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.830
 it stands out that the blackberry and also 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.900
 the iphone shelter they are almost closed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.520
 equally heavy but tasty is slightly heavier 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
 does not make much of it but still 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.060
 they are both very light especially 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.890
 compared to all other smartphones 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.630
 that is never as striking as you looked 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 to screens and the screen bigger then 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 has apple iphone 4 inch screen and the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 blackberry z10 has a four point two 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.430
 in screen this fairies point two a screen 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.780
 so know the and 720 p resolution there 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 be apple iphone and calculator 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 devolution and that is just a little lower 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.600
 that doesn't look wrong what it does 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.920
 stand out is the brightness brightness of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.180
 Apple iPhone can do a bit 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.159
 higher than that of the blackberry z10 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 panel of the iphone is just what 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 we think a better resolution recently 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 the iphone letter slightly better panel 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 then have this place bz10 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.979
 despite the fact that the black mesa 10 has the colors 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 seems just a little better less 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 saturated that is a big plus 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.130
 you have to put the big blackberry logo on 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.420
 taking the screen for granted that is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.890
 when the iphone is that we don't have that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.840
 an the apple logo their iphone logo 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.430
 back just so bar this where the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.409
 blackberry you always see the black 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.810
 widow will focus on either device 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.790
 your face can look like an 8 and still 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 what first of all on the blackberry z10 one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.780
 bit wider than the apple iphone 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.340
 despite the year screen that something 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 bigger is not even that much is you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.700
 wait a piece of free tube piece 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.540
 wider and you just have that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 Unfortunately 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.870
 hold the button on the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.640
 side are a bit the side one 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.200
 Blackberry these are very low in name 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.090
 are not that close quite deep in the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.829
 body and do not protrude through it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.540
 they are also harder to press 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.120
 something not own at the apple iphone 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.620
 really the problem is the blackberry z10 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.299
 is not so very stable that is 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.010
 Quite a pity, but you have to be ready 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.079
 keep in mind that app has been in the for 6 years 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.849
 has had time to go osa west 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.170
 perfect blackberry 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.120
 just normal but with a first release 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.319
 came out so with that a bit 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.489
 unfair comparison 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 but this could never say that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.819
 keep up with 10 or still with football 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.170
 shit and if we are so sorry 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.450
 is not yet completely stable but 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.159
 again quickly like weird but he 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.959
 feels especially to do when school you 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.099
 email setup to do you sometimes are there 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.970
 is then to be able for the first time 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.560
 Set up 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 institution already sees such a call 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.519
 and also allows the maps application 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.430
 wear very low with the app on your 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.139
 iphone is not really its own case anyway 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.760
 see there the eyes on ibooks mine 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.590
 live edge external applications such as 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.569
 Twitter and Facebook sometimes make that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.430
 clear reasons crash and of course 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.540
 also separately and that have my blackberry 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.790
 not yet experienced 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.319
 it's all about the app itself 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.940
 at surf shop will soon appear 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.409
 away and release for this z10 and then 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.629
 most will buks those in the eye 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.370
 be resolved 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.290
 what is striking is that both systems 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.389
 just work differently but stay with you 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.180
 as a team with spikes, work primarily with 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.040
 sweeping across the screen became the off 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.629
 the iphone of course just in the middle with 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.489
 certain buttons such as the home button that 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.199
 you with which I can pick them up institution 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.669
 and then you can also just use the application 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.620
 study left and right swiped 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.180
 actually, but you can do that too 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.250
 just close the application that works 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.079
 So still a world of difference 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.060
 what is also very important is the camera 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.190
 camera of the iphone is a bit 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.269
 better not the blackberry z10 especially 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.560
 in the dark 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.060
 that of the blackberry z10 is almost 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.290
 unusable in the dark and that of the 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.239
 iphone is then pretty reasonable too 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.189
 but is of nice functionality 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.079
 is the time function on the blackberry z10 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.909
 can you take a picture of someone and if 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.229
 you then just have this face with it 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.459
 you can screw it back an account 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.620
 reduce faces 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.139
 because that 10 photo 5 east for and 5 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.919
 photos then made 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.109
 The disadvantage of this is that the quality 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.090
 a little lower is apparently still there 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.320
 but most importantly the room 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.780
 reasonable as that of the iphone 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.009
 I do a bit better than a string 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.139
 you ask the question which we would currently 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.880
 we advise we are there for the iphone 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620
 go it has a few simple ones 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.540
 the everything is an iphone approximately 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.610
 probably once the blackberry z10 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.380
 available in edam is 70 euros more expensive 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.850
 that a blackberry apparently you go 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.380
 probably 600 euros costs something there 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.570
 reasonable hefty amount is a fake iphone 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.600
 currently costs 679 euros 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.950
 so gils 80 euros well that means you 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.380
 actually more true for the iphone 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.390
 your money has to be relatively small amount 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.010
 that day euro is really the difference 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.900
 value of you much more apps place that 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.330
 currently has a 7002 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.950
 app or 19th half million goes in addition 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.420
 works ai west has a bit more stable 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.460
 some more functionality and the apps that 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.180
 so pretty lucky to have time 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.920
 have much more 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.180
 after that they improved the build quality a bit 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.350
 and also the camera of the apple iphone 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.030
 bit better 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.170
 she she can not really well z10 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.840
 chance yet to measure really well with the 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.500
 apple iphone 5 the chance is greater stay with 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.970
 this flew 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.860
 will soon resolve with her first 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180
 fisher's block but the hardware that late 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.620
 left something to be desired 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.930
 then not entirely up-to-date actually 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 with this standard of 2013 but there 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.510
 so you get the iphone of course too 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.780
 not but we are there for the iphone 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.780
 choose
