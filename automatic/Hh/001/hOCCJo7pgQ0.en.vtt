powder

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
powder
we<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.280> kosher<00:00:45.030> salt<00:00:45.329> black<00:00:45.750> pepper<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
garlic powder so we're going to mix this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299

all<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.030> together<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.320> our<00:00:49.350> wet<00:00:49.620> rub<00:00:49.829> very

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
all up together to make our wet rub very

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
all up together to make our wet rub very
very<00:00:50.550> simple<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.300> reason<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
very simple the reason we use this is to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
very simple the reason we use this is to
just<00:00:53.280> combine<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.300> flavors<00:00:54.660> together<00:00:54.840> at

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
just combine all the flavors together at

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.450 
just combine all the flavors together at
once<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.739> could<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> nice<00:00:56.250> even<00:00:56.940> coat<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
once so we could get a nice even coat of

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
once so we could get a nice even coat of
flavor<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.760> around<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.570> every<00:01:00.690> single<00:01:00.960> bite

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
flavor all around in every single bite

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
flavor all around in every single bite
when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> cook<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> add

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
when you cook this so we're going to add

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570 
when you cook this so we're going to add
oil<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:04.170> use<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.409> olive<00:01:04.589> oil<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
oil we use an olive oil right here you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
oil we use an olive oil right here you
could<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.939> regular<00:01:06.450> canola<00:01:06.930> oil

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
could use regular canola oil

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
could use regular canola oil
I<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> olive<00:01:08.250> oil<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.299> gives

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I like the olive oil because just gives

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.850 
I like the olive oil because just gives
a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.900> more<00:01:10.049> flavor<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.740> more

deaths<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.350> we're<00:01:13.350> going

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
deaths so we're going to do we're going

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.670 
deaths so we're going to do we're going
to<00:01:13.530> rub<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.490> side<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> steak<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
to rub one side of the steak with it

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
to rub one side of the steak with it
making<00:01:16.680> sure<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.159> every<00:01:17.880> single<00:01:18.090> corner

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
making sure we get every single corner

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.440 
making sure we get every single corner
so<00:01:19.350> once<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> row<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.070> both<00:01:20.520> sides<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.420> a
