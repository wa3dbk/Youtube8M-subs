00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
hi and welcome to the first video on the

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.400 
hi and welcome to the first video on the
nervous<00:00:13.550> system<00:00:14.150> we're<00:00:15.080> going<00:00:15.230> to<00:00:15.290> break

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
nervous system we're going to break

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.800 
nervous system we're going to break
these<00:00:15.559> videos<00:00:15.950> into<00:00:16.250> three<00:00:16.670> separate<00:00:17.360> series

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
these videos into three separate series

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.109 
these videos into three separate series
this<00:00:18.590> first<00:00:18.980> series<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.640> going<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.939> take<00:00:20.090> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
this first series is going to take a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.820 
this first series is going to take a
look<00:00:20.390> at<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.570> histology<00:00:20.960> of<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.439> nervous

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
look at the histology of the nervous

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.359 
look at the histology of the nervous
system

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
system

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.279 
system
so<00:00:22.820> we'll<00:00:22.970> take<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.180> look<00:00:23.390> at<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.599> neurons<00:00:24.020> and

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
so we'll take a look at the neurons and

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.160 
so we'll take a look at the neurons and
the<00:00:24.710> Nergal<00:00:25.100> yeah<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.210> second<00:00:26.810> series<00:00:27.020> of

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
the Nergal yeah the second series of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.109 
the Nergal yeah the second series of
videos<00:00:27.619> we'll<00:00:27.830> take<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:27.980> look<00:00:28.220> at<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.460> larger

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
videos we'll take a look at the larger

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.210 
videos we'll take a look at the larger
structures<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.350> nervous<00:00:30.529> system<00:00:30.680> for

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
structures in the nervous system for

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.100 
structures in the nervous system for
example<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.730> brain<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.270> spinal<00:00:32.599> cord<00:00:32.720> and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
example the brain in the spinal cord and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.470 
example the brain in the spinal cord and
the<00:00:33.920> third<00:00:34.160> series<00:00:34.550> we'll<00:00:34.879> take<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.059> look<00:00:35.330> at

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
the third series we'll take a look at

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.009 
the third series we'll take a look at
these<00:00:35.629> special<00:00:36.170> senses<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.910> let's<00:00:38.360> begin<00:00:38.570> by

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
these special senses so let's begin by

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.530 
these special senses so let's begin by
taking<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.440> look<00:00:39.590> at<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.830> histology<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.610> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
taking a look at the histology of the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.170 
taking a look at the histology of the
nervous<00:00:41.870> system<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.350> series<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.829> videos<00:00:43.180> but

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
nervous system this series of videos but

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.750 
nervous system this series of videos but
let's<00:00:44.360> begin<00:00:44.510> by<00:00:44.660> first<00:00:45.050> describing<00:00:46.040> what<00:00:46.550> is

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
let's begin by first describing what is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.450 
let's begin by first describing what is
the<00:00:47.030> nervous<00:00:47.239> system<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.590> nervous<00:00:48.770> system<00:00:49.340> is

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
the nervous system the nervous system is

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.990 
the nervous system the nervous system is
composed<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:51.079> brain<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:52.219> spinal<00:00:52.579> cord

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
composed of the brain the spinal cord

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.940 
composed of the brain the spinal cord
and<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.629> nerves<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.230> rest<00:00:54.500> of<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.739> body

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
and the nerves to the rest of the body

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.970 
and the nerves to the rest of the body
you'll<00:00:55.910> notice<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:56.540> on<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.350> graphic<00:00:57.620> we

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
you'll notice that on that graphic we

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.410 
you'll notice that on that graphic we
had<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.280> CNS<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.690> pns<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.250> CNS<00:01:01.910> stands

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
had the CNS and the pns the CNS stands

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.410 
had the CNS and the pns the CNS stands
for<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.930> central<00:01:03.559> nervous<00:01:03.950> system<00:01:04.390> while<00:01:05.390> the

p NS stands for the peripheral nervous

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.540 
p NS stands for the peripheral nervous
system<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.440> we'll<00:01:09.860> get<00:01:10.009> into<00:01:10.160> that<00:01:10.340> into<00:01:10.520> a

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
system and we'll get into that into a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.790 
system and we'll get into that into a
lot<00:01:10.789> more<00:01:10.820> detail<00:01:11.390> when<00:01:11.990> we<00:01:12.140> start<00:01:12.380> talking

going to control the body now little
heads<00:01:29.390> up<00:01:29.569> when<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:29.929> talk<00:01:30.110> about<00:01:30.259> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
heads up when we talk about the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.050 
heads up when we talk about the
endocrine<00:01:30.860> system<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.490> endocrine<00:01:32.000> system

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
endocrine system the endocrine system

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.690 
endocrine system the endocrine system
also<00:01:32.599> controls<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.319> body<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.280> does<00:01:34.429> a<00:01:34.459> few

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
also controls the body but it does a few

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.540 
also controls the body but it does a few
different<00:01:35.030> means<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:36.050> for<00:01:36.349> us<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.039> nervous

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
different means so for us the nervous

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.279 
different means so for us the nervous
system<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:38.030> composed<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.599> the<00:01:38.810> brain<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
system is composed of the brain the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.990 
system is composed of the brain the
spinal<00:01:39.560> cord<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.310> nerves<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.819> rest

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
spinal cord and the nerves to the rest

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.330 
spinal cord and the nerves to the rest
of<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.209> body<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.690> its<00:01:42.229> job<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.979> regulate

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
of the body and its job is to regulate

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.460 
of the body and its job is to regulate
the<00:01:43.819> body<00:01:44.030> we're<00:01:44.990> gonna<00:01:45.050> break<00:01:45.259> things<00:01:45.440> down

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the body we're gonna break things down

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.230 
the body we're gonna break things down
even<00:01:45.770> further<00:01:45.979> by<00:01:46.310> looking<00:01:46.640> at<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.880> histology

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
even further by looking at the histology

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.180 
even further by looking at the histology
so<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.810> nerve<00:01:47.990> system<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.530> composed<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.130> two

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
so the nerve system is composed of two

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.850 
so the nerve system is composed of two
general<00:01:49.849> types<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:50.390> cells<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:51.440> have<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
general types of cells we have the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.029 
general types of cells we have the
neuron<00:01:52.280> ie<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.239> nerve<00:01:53.479> cell<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
neuron ie the nerve cell and the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.279 
neuron ie the nerve cell and the
neuroglia<00:01:55.700> which<00:01:56.179> is<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.479> nerve<00:01:56.690> glue<00:01:57.080> these

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
neuroglia which is the nerve glue these

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.279 
neuroglia which is the nerve glue these
are<00:01:57.560> supporting<00:01:58.280> cells<00:01:58.810> we'll<00:01:59.810> start<00:02:00.140> with

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
are supporting cells we'll start with

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.749 
are supporting cells we'll start with
the<00:02:00.440> building<00:02:00.890> blocks<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.459> nervous

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
the building blocks of the nervous

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.690 
the building blocks of the nervous
system<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.300> work<00:02:02.599> our<00:02:02.810> way<00:02:02.840> up<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:03.440> there<00:02:03.920> so

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
system and work our way up from there so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.660 
system and work our way up from there so
let's<00:02:05.119> begin<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:05.899> our<00:02:06.229> next<00:02:06.649> video<00:02:06.979> by<00:02:07.250> taking

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
let's begin in our next video by taking

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.969 
let's begin in our next video by taking
a<00:02:07.759> look<00:02:07.880> at<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.360> neurons<00:02:09.080> themselves<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
a look at the neurons themselves the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.670 
a look at the neurons themselves the
portions<00:02:10.610> or<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> parts<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.569> make<00:02:12.140> up<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
portions or the parts that make up the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.380 
portions or the parts that make up the
neuron

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.450 

yeah
