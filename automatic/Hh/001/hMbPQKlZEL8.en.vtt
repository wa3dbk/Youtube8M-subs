with almost it's like medium to full
coverage<00:00:17.320> I'd<00:00:17.980> say<00:00:18.250> because<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.210> can

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
coverage I'd say because you can

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.939 
coverage I'd say because you can
definitely<00:00:19.540> build<00:00:20.020> it<00:00:20.140> up<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.560> doesn't

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
definitely build it up and it doesn't

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.439 
definitely build it up and it doesn't

good<00:00:53.920> quality<00:00:54.339> and<00:00:54.670> nice<00:00:54.909> so<00:00:55.269> I<00:00:55.299> just<00:00:55.540> use<00:00:55.720> this

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
good quality and nice so I just use this

good quality and nice so I just use this
and<00:00:56.290> then<00:00:57.100> I<00:00:57.369> pump<00:00:58.089> a<00:00:58.239> little<00:00:58.540> bit<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.989> this

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
and then I pump a little bit of this

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.200 
and then I pump a little bit of this
onto<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.619> back<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.860> my<00:00:59.949> hand<00:01:00.159> it's<00:01:01.000> kind<00:01:01.180> of

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
onto the back of my hand it's kind of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.679 
onto the back of my hand it's kind of
hard<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.449> show<00:01:01.839> this<00:01:02.080> but<00:01:02.589> you<00:01:02.920> just<00:01:03.299> so<00:01:04.299> as<00:01:04.540> you

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
hard to show this but you just so as you

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.050 
hard to show this but you just so as you
can<00:01:04.839> see<00:01:05.049> it's<00:01:05.320> really<00:01:06.100> really<00:01:06.369> liquidy<00:01:06.640> and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
can see it's really really liquidy and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.580 
can see it's really really liquidy and
I'm<00:01:07.270> just<00:01:07.479> going<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.660> take<00:01:07.900> my<00:01:08.080> brush<00:01:08.290> and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
I'm just going to take my brush and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.910 
I'm just going to take my brush and
start<00:01:09.220> applying<00:01:09.760> this<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.290> areas<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.740> I

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
start applying this to the areas that I

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.540 
start applying this to the areas that I
need<00:01:12.160> it<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.310> most

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.850 

it<00:01:15.550> goes<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:16.060> really<00:01:16.390> really<00:01:17.200> nicely<00:01:17.440> it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
it goes on really really nicely it

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.910 
it goes on really really nicely it
blends<00:01:18.280> out<00:01:18.490> amazingly<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:20.290> doesn't<00:01:20.620> dry

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
blends out amazingly and it doesn't dry

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.040 
blends out amazingly and it doesn't dry
too<00:01:20.980> fast<00:01:21.310> which<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.240> like<00:01:22.450> because<00:01:22.720> then<00:01:22.960> I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
too fast which I like because then I

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.930 
too fast which I like because then I
have<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> chance<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.680> really<00:01:23.920> blend<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:24.550> into<00:01:24.700> my

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
have a chance to really blend it into my

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.930 
have a chance to really blend it into my
skin<00:01:25.210> before<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.440> dries<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.130> leaves<00:01:27.430> streak

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
skin before it dries and leaves streak

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.550 
skin before it dries and leaves streak
marks<00:01:28.180> as<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.810> can<00:01:28.930> see<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.200> little<00:01:29.410> red

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
marks as you can see the little red

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.870 
marks as you can see the little red
spots<00:01:29.860> I<00:01:29.980> have<00:01:30.130> right<00:01:30.310> here<00:01:30.430> are<00:01:30.670> already

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
spots I have right here are already

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.700 
spots I have right here are already
covered<00:01:31.510> up<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:31.900> just<00:01:32.140> use<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.290> really<00:01:32.680> thin

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
covered up and I just use a really thin

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.640 
covered up and I just use a really thin
layer<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.430> this<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.900> you<00:01:34.990> find<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.440> you'd

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
layer of this I do you find that you'd

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.160 
layer of this I do you find that you'd
like<00:01:35.830> two<00:01:36.460> two<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.210> half<00:01:37.360> pumps<00:01:37.720> for<00:01:38.080> my

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
like two two and a half pumps for my

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.470 
like two two and a half pumps for my
entire<00:01:38.440> face<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:38.980> I'm<00:01:39.040> just<00:01:39.220> going<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.490> pump<00:01:40.360> a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
entire face so I'm just going to pump a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.590 
entire face so I'm just going to pump a
little<00:01:40.750> more<00:01:40.990> out<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.950> my<00:01:42.100> other<00:01:42.450> side<00:01:43.450> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
little more out and do my other side of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.880 
little more out and do my other side of
my<00:01:43.720> face

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.760 

I'd<00:01:49.250> say<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.580> finish<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.810> kind<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.530> a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
I'd say the finish of this is kind of a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.490 
I'd say the finish of this is kind of a
like<00:01:52.460> Demi<00:01:52.820> finish<00:01:53.360> because<00:01:54.050> it's<00:01:54.350> not

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
like Demi finish because it's not

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.860 
like Demi finish because it's not
completely<00:01:55.100> matte<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.420> doesn't<00:01:56.690> leave

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
completely matte but it doesn't leave

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.370 
completely matte but it doesn't leave
you

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.920 
you
oily<00:01:57.920> or<00:01:58.400> shiny<00:01:58.820> or<00:01:59.150> anything<00:01:59.540> like<00:01:59.869> that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
oily or shiny or anything like that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.960 
oily or shiny or anything like that
which<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.470> really<00:02:00.950> really<00:02:00.979> like<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.640> have

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
which I really really like I have

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.260 
which I really really like I have
combination<00:02:02.600> skin<00:02:02.630> because<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.320> do<00:02:03.500> use

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
combination skin because I do use

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.719 
combination skin because I do use
treatment<00:02:05.270> for<00:02:06.050> my<00:02:06.229> acne<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.250> really

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
treatment for my acne and that really

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.850 
treatment for my acne and that really
dries<00:02:08.119> out<00:02:08.300> my<00:02:08.360> skin<00:02:08.840> but<00:02:09.080> normally<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.560> have

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
dries out my skin but normally I have

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.430 
dries out my skin but normally I have
like<00:02:10.070> oily<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.550> combo<00:02:10.970> skin<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.170> kind<00:02:12.380> of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
like oily to combo skin so it's kind of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.500 
like oily to combo skin so it's kind of
weird<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.520> foundation<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:14.240> works

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
weird and this foundation just works

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
weird and this foundation just works
perfectly<00:02:15.080> because<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.500> doesn't<00:02:15.920> make<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
perfectly because it doesn't make the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.790 
perfectly because it doesn't make the
oily<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.360> also<00:02:17.480> doesn't<00:02:17.870> accentuate<00:02:18.350> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
oily but it also doesn't accentuate the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.040 
oily but it also doesn't accentuate the
dry<00:02:19.010> spots<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.489> have<00:02:19.840> any<00:02:20.840> veins<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.620> my<00:02:21.770> eyes

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
dry spots I have any veins on my eyes

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.630 
dry spots I have any veins on my eyes

and then I'm just wanting to blend it

Pat<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.930> rather<00:04:37.169> than<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.740> go<00:04:38.070> like<00:04:38.250> that

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.560 
because then I feel like the foundation
and<00:04:41.070> concealer<00:04:41.100> comes<00:04:41.820> off<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> little<00:04:42.210> bit<00:04:42.510> so

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
and concealer comes off a little bit so

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.560 
and concealer comes off a little bit so
