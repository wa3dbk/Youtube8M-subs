00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.060 
it back in and that's awesome but anyway
these<00:02:17.830> cases<00:02:18.570> can<00:02:19.570> run<00:02:19.870> upwards<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.770> hundred

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
these cases can run upwards of a hundred

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.250 
these cases can run upwards of a hundred
to<00:02:21.820> two<00:02:22.090> hundred<00:02:22.120> dollars<00:02:22.720> depending<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
to two hundred dollars depending on the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.000 
to two hundred dollars depending on the
size<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.160> case<00:02:24.720> mine<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.930> 17<00:02:26.560> inch<00:02:26.739> case

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
size of the case mine is a 17 inch case

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.170 
size of the case mine is a 17 inch case
so<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:28.510> was<00:02:28.750> quite<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> pretty<00:02:29.650> penny<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.310> it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
so it was quite a pretty penny but it's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.030 
so it was quite a pretty penny but it's
worth<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.780> investment<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.500> my<00:02:32.650> opinion

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
worth the investment in my opinion

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.100 
worth the investment in my opinion
because<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.760> gonna<00:02:34.030> keep<00:02:34.239> your<00:02:34.540> knife<00:02:34.690> safe

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
because it's gonna keep your knife safe

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.199 
because it's gonna keep your knife safe
and<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.070> great<00:02:36.310> way<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.489> storm<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.090> my

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and it's a great way to storm in my

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.990 
and it's a great way to storm in my
opinion<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.489> first<00:02:39.730> thing<00:02:39.910> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
opinion but that's the first thing you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.850 
opinion but that's the first thing you
need<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.239> know<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.989> second<00:02:41.440> thing<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.680> need

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
need to know the second thing you need

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.810 
need to know the second thing you need
to<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:42.130> is<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:44.500> styrofoam<00:02:45.250> called

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
to know is that the styrofoam called

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.930 
to know is that the styrofoam called
pick<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.330> pluck<00:02:47.070> sounds<00:02:48.070> very<00:02:48.190> easy<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.760> do

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
pick and pluck sounds very easy to do

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.979 
pick and pluck sounds very easy to do
but<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:49.989> not<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.920> my<00:02:51.130> opinion<00:02:51.160> it's

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
but it is not in my opinion it's

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.050 
but it is not in my opinion it's
extremely<00:02:52.989> time<00:02:53.799> consuming<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:54.610> need<00:02:54.940> to

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
extremely time consuming you need to

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.789 
extremely time consuming you need to
have<00:02:55.180> patience<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.110> you're<00:02:56.230> gonna<00:02:56.350> do<00:02:56.590> this

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
have patience if you're gonna do this

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.030 
have patience if you're gonna do this
because<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:58.360> not<00:02:58.570> like<00:02:58.840> picking<00:02:59.380> out<00:02:59.680> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
because it's not like picking out the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.539 
because it's not like picking out the
little<00:03:01.019> pre-cut<00:03:02.019> buy<00:03:03.360> boxes<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.630> styrofoam

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
little pre-cut buy boxes of styrofoam

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.280 
little pre-cut buy boxes of styrofoam
you<00:03:06.549> have<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.970> actually<00:03:07.120> take<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> knife<00:03:08.019> and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
you have to actually take a knife and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.259 
you have to actually take a knife and
cut<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.630> way<00:03:10.750> through<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.790> direct<00:03:13.120> in

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
cut all the way through in the direct in

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.270 
cut all the way through in the direct in
the<00:03:13.450> shape<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.380> whatever<00:03:14.650> you're<00:03:14.950> trying<00:03:15.100> to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the shape of whatever you're trying to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.740 
the shape of whatever you're trying to
store<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:16.989> very<00:03:17.290> consuming<00:03:17.920> these<00:03:18.750> all

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
store so it's very consuming these all

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.090 
store so it's very consuming these all
of<00:03:19.959> these<00:03:20.079> slots<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.680> here

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
of these slots on here

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370 
of these slots on here
took<00:03:21.579> me<00:03:21.700> about<00:03:21.730> an<00:03:22.090> hour<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.480> half<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.079> up

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
a nice sharp knife the two knives that I

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.240 
a nice sharp knife the two knives that I
used<00:03:46.280> was<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.580> Spyderco<00:03:47.180> UK<00:03:47.540> PK<00:03:47.989> which<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.830> did<00:03:49.040> to

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
used was a Spyderco UK PK which I did to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
used was a Spyderco UK PK which I did to
cut<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.610> edges<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.750> use<00:03:50.930> my<00:03:51.110> Emerson

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
cut the edges and I use my Emerson

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.860 
cut the edges and I use my Emerson
because<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:51.980> has<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.100> nice<00:03:52.310> thin<00:03:52.640> blade<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.690> cut

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
because it has a nice thin blade to cut

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.280 
because it has a nice thin blade to cut
the<00:03:54.170> shorter<00:03:54.739> end<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.750> don't<00:03:56.870> need<00:03:57.050> those

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
the shorter end so you don't need those

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.120 
the shorter end so you don't need those
