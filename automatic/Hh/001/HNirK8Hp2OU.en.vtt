00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.260 

one<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.250> my<00:00:02.370> last<00:00:02.580> hurdles<00:00:04.400> to<00:00:05.400> jump<00:00:05.430> was<00:00:06.089> my

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
one of my last hurdles to jump was my

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.720 
one of my last hurdles to jump was my
original<00:00:06.420> cranky<00:00:07.170> after<00:00:07.620> didn't<00:00:08.069> work<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
original cranky after didn't work the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
original cranky after didn't work the
engine<00:00:08.910> turn<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> slow<00:00:09.630> for<00:00:09.870> starting<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.469> it

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
engine turn is slow for starting and it

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110 
engine turn is slow for starting and it
turns<00:00:10.800> out<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> teeth<00:00:11.580> were<00:00:11.610> shaped

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
turns out that the teeth were shaped

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.140 
turns out that the teeth were shaped
wrong<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> they<00:00:12.780> were<00:00:12.840> too<00:00:13.110> small<00:00:13.790> so<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.940> came

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
wrong and they were too small so we came

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.359 
wrong and they were too small so we came
up<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.630> new<00:00:15.839> crank<00:00:16.260> trigger<00:00:16.379> setup<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
up with this new crank trigger setup it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.609 
up with this new crank trigger setup it
runs<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.820> crankshaft<00:00:18.510> speed<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.080> has<00:00:19.230> square

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
runs at crankshaft speed and has square

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.490 
runs at crankshaft speed and has square
teeth<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.279> also<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.150> rid<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.660> VR<00:00:21.960> sensor

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
teeth I also got rid of the VR sensor

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.170 
teeth I also got rid of the VR sensor
and<00:00:22.650> went<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> halt<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.369> mech<00:00:23.550> sensor<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and went to a halt of mech sensor and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
and went to a halt of mech sensor and
that<00:00:24.300> solved<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.810> problem<00:00:27.830> when<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.250> got

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that solved my problem when I first got

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.569 
that solved my problem when I first got
the<00:00:29.730> engine<00:00:30.119> running<00:00:30.150> once<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.289> ran<00:00:31.980> good<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the engine running once I ran good but

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.420 
the engine running once I ran good but
the<00:00:32.700> other<00:00:32.850> side<00:00:33.120> sounded<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.870> raggedy<00:00:34.430> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the other side sounded all raggedy it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
the other side sounded all raggedy it
took<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.940> while<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.329> figure<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.840> when<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
took a little while to figure out when I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
took a little while to figure out when I
wired<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.670> ignition<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.660> looked<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
wired up the ignition I looked at the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
wired up the ignition I looked at the
book<00:00:40.469> wrong<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> wired<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> engine<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
book wrong and wired up the engine as a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
book wrong and wired up the engine as a
left-hand<00:00:42.660> engine<00:00:43.110> instead<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.860> hand

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
left-hand engine instead of a right hand

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.150 
left-hand engine instead of a right hand
edge<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> made<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.989> Bank<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
edge and so it made one Bank right and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
edge and so it made one Bank right and
one<00:00:47.879> bank<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.390> messed<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.440> took<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> little

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
one bank all messed up it took a little

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
one bank all messed up it took a little
head<00:00:50.160> scratching<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> figure<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.510> was

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
head scratching to figure out what was

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
head scratching to figure out what was
going<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> cheap<00:00:53.850> laptop<00:00:54.449> off

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
going on there I got a cheap laptop off

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
going on there I got a cheap laptop off
eBay<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> started<00:00:55.800> working<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.460> timing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
eBay and started working on my timing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
eBay and started working on my timing
and<00:00:57.090> fuel<00:00:57.329> curve<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> small<00:00:58.800> problem

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and fuel curve I had a small problem

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
and fuel curve I had a small problem
with<00:00:59.430> my<00:00:59.579> wideband

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
with my wideband

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
with my wideband
oxygen<00:01:00.809> sensor<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:02.100> gauge<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> car

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
oxygen sensor the gauge in the car

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.729 
oxygen sensor the gauge in the car
worked<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> computer<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.500> read

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
worked what the computer would not read

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.590 
worked what the computer would not read
it<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> turned<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.880> used<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> white

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it so it turned out I used the white

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.910 
it so it turned out I used the white
wire<00:01:06.840> instead<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> brown<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:09.680> am<00:01:10.680> using

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
wire instead of the brown I am using

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
wire instead of the brown I am using
tuner<00:01:11.400> studio<00:01:11.970> software<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.960> fine-tune<00:01:13.560> my

fuel<00:01:14.220> curve<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> taking<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:15.810> longer

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fuel curve it is taking a little longer

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.249 
fuel curve it is taking a little longer
to<00:01:16.790> figure<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.390> thought<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.140> am

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to figure out than I thought but I am

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.730 
to figure out than I thought but I am
gaining<00:01:20.030> been<00:01:21.030> taking<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.229> car<00:01:22.470> shows

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
gaining been taking it to some car shows

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
gaining been taking it to some car shows
and<00:01:22.770> starting<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> got<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> little

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and starting it up but I got a little

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
and starting it up but I got a little
ways<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:25.049> before<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.710> road<00:01:25.950> ready

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
ways to go before I'm road ready

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
ways to go before I'm road ready
I<00:01:26.490> also<00:01:26.939> added<00:01:27.299> three<00:01:27.689> switches<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> control

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I also added three switches to control

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.550 
I also added three switches to control
the<00:01:29.610> fuel<00:01:29.880> pump<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> fuel<00:01:30.750> injectors<00:01:31.320> in

the fuel pump and the fuel injectors in
the<00:01:31.680> ignition<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.479> used<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> am

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the ignition I used these when I am

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
the ignition I used these when I am
