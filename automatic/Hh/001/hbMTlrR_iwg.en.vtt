00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
just mix this up a loop for us a little

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.520 
just mix this up a loop for us a little
short<00:02:56.160> one<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.390> last<00:02:57.629> stage<00:02:57.959> I'm<00:02:58.319> just

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
short one for the last stage I'm just

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.449 
short one for the last stage I'm just
going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> fold<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.000> bit<00:03:00.269> at<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.480> time<00:03:00.510> my

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
going to fold in a bit at a time my

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.750 
going to fold in a bit at a time my
flour<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:03.140> cup<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:05.060> self-raising<00:03:06.060> flour<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
flour my cup of self-raising flour and

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.690 
flour my cup of self-raising flour and
1/3<00:03:08.760> cups<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.390> plain<00:03:10.200> flour<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.430> I'm<00:03:11.519> just

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
1/3 cups of plain flour so I'm just

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000 
1/3 cups of plain flour so I'm just
going<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.940> add<00:03:12.090> my<00:03:12.299> self-raising<00:03:13.109> flour<00:03:13.140> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
going to add my self-raising flour to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.390 
going to add my self-raising flour to
that<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:15.569> left<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.799> put<00:03:17.220> about<00:03:17.430> 1/3<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.150> my

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
that and I left I put about 1/3 of my

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.650 
that and I left I put about 1/3 of my
egg<00:03:20.400> whites<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.209> we're<00:03:21.359> just<00:03:21.389> going<00:03:21.599> to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
egg whites in then we're just going to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.909 
egg whites in then we're just going to
fold<00:03:21.930> gently<00:03:22.319> fold<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:23.430> through<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.560> think

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
fold gently fold that through so I think

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.800 
fold gently fold that through so I think
that's<00:03:26.220> probably<00:03:26.519> about<00:03:26.760> as<00:03:27.030> much<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.630> want

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
that's probably about as much as I want

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.240 
that's probably about as much as I want
to<00:03:27.870> fold<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.349> it's<00:03:28.470> pretty<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:28.889> mixed

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
to fold it it's pretty well mixed

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
to fold it it's pretty well mixed
through<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.269> pour<00:03:30.569> this

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
through now I'm just going to pour this

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.949 
through now I'm just going to pour this
into<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.319> cake<00:03:32.250> tin<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.419> I'll<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.660> place<00:03:33.930> my

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
take it off the heat so this is what it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.450 
take it off the heat so this is what it
looks<00:04:23.690> like<00:04:23.930> when<00:04:24.200> it's<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.500> about<00:04:25.070> finished

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460
