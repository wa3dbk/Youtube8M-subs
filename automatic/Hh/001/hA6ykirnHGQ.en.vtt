00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
don't have to click anymore and so you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.530 
don't have to click anymore and so you
can<00:04:13.680> watch<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.069> screen<00:04:14.340> more<00:04:14.639> you<00:04:15.150> are

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
can watch the screen more you are

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.560 
can watch the screen more you are
completely<00:04:16.320> down<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.009> a<00:04:17.070> science<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.820> what<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
completely down to a science of what to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.819 
completely down to a science of what to
keybind<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.169> this<00:04:19.259> kind<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.500> leads<00:04:19.650> into

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
keybind and this kind of leads into

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.550 
keybind and this kind of leads into
number<00:04:20.220> three<00:04:20.759> here<00:04:21.030> or<00:04:21.180> number<00:04:21.419> 42<00:04:21.989> side<00:04:22.260> and

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
number three here or number 42 side and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.720 
number three here or number 42 side and
number<00:04:23.190> two<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> be<00:04:23.820> muscle<00:04:24.240> memory

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
number two is going to be muscle memory

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.580 
number two is going to be muscle memory
now<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.420> is<00:04:25.480> a<00:04:25.570> huge<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.140> lot<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.350> people<00:04:26.530> i

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
now this is a huge one a lot of people i

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.980 
now this is a huge one a lot of people i
think<00:04:26.620> overlook<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.370> as<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.990> contributing

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
think overlook this as a contributing

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.720 
think overlook this as a contributing
factor<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.410> be<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.620> really<00:04:29.860> good<00:04:30.040> pvp<00:04:30.340> ER<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
factor to be a really good pvp ER and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.210 
factor to be a really good pvp ER and
that's<00:04:31.210> because<00:04:31.710> they<00:04:32.710> don't<00:04:32.740> really<00:04:33.070> think

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
that's because they don't really think

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.800 
that's because they don't really think
about<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.670> they're<00:04:33.970> just<00:04:34.180> good<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.390> keep<00:04:34.510> on<00:04:34.720> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
about it they're just good to keep on it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.790 
about it they're just good to keep on it
i<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:34.960> they're<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.140> good<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.590> they<00:04:35.710> think

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
i think they're just good and they think

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.620 
i think they're just good and they think
it's<00:04:35.920> his<00:04:36.070> practice<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.640> in<00:04:36.970> reality<00:04:37.150> it's

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
it's his practice but in reality it's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.270 
it's his practice but in reality it's
muscle<00:04:37.930> memory<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.560> what's<00:04:38.770> making<00:04:38.950> you

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
muscle memory this is what's making you

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.760 
muscle memory this is what's making you
a<00:04:39.490> good<00:04:40.090> player<00:04:40.330> BP<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:40.960> reaction<00:04:41.380> time

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
a good player BP is the reaction time

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.200 
a good player BP is the reaction time
you<00:04:42.190> know<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:42.550> depressed<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.030> know<00:04:43.060> with

don't have really good muscle memory

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.060 
don't have really good muscle memory
because<00:04:48.370> they<00:04:49.030> fuck<00:04:49.750> up<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.140> they<00:04:50.230> kind<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.560> do

how<00:05:06.490> far<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.880> key<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.390> know<00:05:07.480> how<00:05:07.600> they'd

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
how far the key is you know how they'd

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.480 
how far the key is you know how they'd
shift<00:05:08.020> three<00:05:08.320> you<00:05:08.860> know<00:05:08.950> how<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.130> use<00:05:09.250> your

fucking razer naga you now to use

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.290 
fucking razer naga you now to use
everything<00:05:11.140> it's<00:05:12.100> all<00:05:12.310> muscle<00:05:12.700> memory<00:05:13.090> and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
everything it's all muscle memory and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.180 
everything it's all muscle memory and
this<00:05:13.390> again<00:05:13.780> comes<00:05:14.260> from<00:05:14.500> practice<00:05:14.890> but<00:05:15.040> it's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
this again comes from practice but it's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.650 
this again comes from practice but it's
gonna<00:05:15.310> take<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.520> long<00:05:15.730> time<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.030> get<00:05:16.210> down<00:05:16.360> and

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
gonna take a long time to get down and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.390 
gonna take a long time to get down and
it's<00:05:17.170> getting<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.470> lot<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.620> practice<00:05:18.040> even<00:05:18.220> if

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
it's getting a lot of practice even if

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.310 
it's getting a lot of practice even if
you're<00:05:18.520> not<00:05:18.550> pvping<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.810> going<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.200> sitting

rotation that will also help just using

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.920 
rotation that will also help just using
those<00:05:27.400> abilities<00:05:27.640> it's<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.270> hardest<00:05:28.690> ones

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.470 
are going to be the abilities you don't
use<00:05:30.010> often<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:30.610> are<00:05:30.700> important<00:05:31.120> for<00:05:31.210> instance

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
use often but are important for instance

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.780 
use often but are important for instance
like<00:05:31.570> cici's<00:05:32.020> or<00:05:32.320> tranq<00:05:33.010> shots<00:05:33.130> or<00:05:33.670> something

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
like cici's or tranq shots or something

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.370 
like cici's or tranq shots or something
like<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.870> not<00:05:34.990> in<00:05:35.110> your<00:05:35.170> normal

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
like that it's not in your normal

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.440 
like that it's not in your normal
rotation<00:05:35.680> but<00:05:36.640> in<00:05:36.850> certain<00:05:37.180> situations

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
rotation but in certain situations

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.750 
rotation but in certain situations
they're<00:05:37.990> crucial<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:39.040> because<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.430> those

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
they're crucial so because of that those

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.700 
they're crucial so because of that those
ones<00:05:39.970> will<00:05:40.090> be<00:05:40.120> hard<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.690> get<00:05:41.050> down<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.440> muscle

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
ones will be hard to get down to muscle

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.600 
ones will be hard to get down to muscle
memory<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.100> that's<00:05:42.220> why<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.400> should

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
memory and that's why you should

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.010 
memory and that's why you should
practice<00:05:42.790> them<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.270> get<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:43.480> down<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.870> once

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
practice them and get it down and once

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.690 
practice them and get it down and once
you<00:05:44.110> have<00:05:44.320> them<00:05:44.440> as<00:05:44.560> muscle<00:05:44.800> memory<00:05:44.950> you'll<00:05:45.550> be

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
you have them as muscle memory you'll be

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.520 
you have them as muscle memory you'll be
at<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.030> distinct<00:05:46.690> advantage<00:05:46.810> from<00:05:47.350> other

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
at a distinct advantage from other

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.160 
at a distinct advantage from other
players<00:05:47.800> number<00:05:48.700> one<00:05:48.940> is<00:05:49.180> going<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.570> bcc

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
players number one is going to bcc

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.830 
players number one is going to bcc
awareness<00:05:50.980> now<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:52.090> reason<00:05:52.270> this<00:05:52.480> is<00:05:52.540> number

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
awareness now the reason this is number

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.970 
awareness now the reason this is number
one<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.320> i<00:05:53.380> think<00:05:53.560> this<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.830> biggest

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
one and i think this is the biggest

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.680 
one and i think this is the biggest
point<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.580> because<00:05:54.940> i've<00:05:55.120> played<00:05:55.390> many<00:05:55.630> a

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
point is because i've played many a

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.480 
point is because i've played many a
character<00:05:56.110> or<00:05:56.200> play<00:05:56.350> two<00:05:56.410> minute<00:05:56.650> class<00:05:56.950> where
