we started out with semifinals rounds

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.050 
we started out with semifinals rounds
and<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.590> stage<00:01:42.590> about<00:01:43.460> half<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
and in that stage about half of the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.270 
and in that stage about half of the
players<00:01:44.300> were<00:01:44.630> weeded<00:01:44.929> out<00:01:45.050> and<00:01:45.440> so<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.160> went

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
players were weeded out and so it went

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.210 
players were weeded out and so it went
from<00:01:46.490> 69<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.390> 32<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.410> then<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.830> finals

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
from 69 to 32 and then in the finals

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.630 
from 69 to 32 and then in the finals
round<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:50.149> was<00:01:50.390> done<00:01:50.690> by<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.350> seeding<00:01:51.920> kind<00:01:52.429> of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
round it was done by a seeding kind of

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.690 
round it was done by a seeding kind of
system<00:01:53.569> it<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.200> seeds<00:01:54.440> were<00:01:54.619> from<00:01:54.860> 1<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.369> 32

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
system it the seeds were from 1 to 32

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.850 
system it the seeds were from 1 to 32
it's<00:01:56.149> very<00:01:56.360> similar<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.350> college

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
it's very similar to a college

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.340 
it's very similar to a college
basketball<00:01:58.039> actually<00:01:58.910> so<00:01:59.420> then<00:01:59.600> you<00:02:00.170> have

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
basketball actually so then you have

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.010 
basketball actually so then you have
different<00:02:00.710> rounds<00:02:01.250> going<00:02:01.580> from<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.330> top<00:02:02.509> seed

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
different rounds going from the top seed

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.139 
different rounds going from the top seed
plays<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.440> 30<00:02:03.649> second<00:02:04.069> seed<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:04.729> on<00:02:04.940> until

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
plays the 30 second seed and so on until

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.600 
plays the 30 second seed and so on until
you<00:02:05.420> get<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.690> finals<00:02:06.080> round<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.530> which<00:02:07.280> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
you get to the finals round in which the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.779 
you get to the finals round in which the
first<00:02:07.940> plays<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.929> second<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.500> then<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.610> big

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
first plays the second and then the big

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.800 
first plays the second and then the big

nerve-wracking because the top seeded
player<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.580> always<00:02:23.060> put<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.620> big<00:02:25.250> screen

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
player is always put on the big screen

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.240 
player is always put on the big screen
for<00:02:26.090> everyone<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> audience<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.319> see<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.220> I

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
for everyone in the audience to see so I

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.070 
for everyone in the audience to see so I
was<00:02:28.580> up<00:02:28.730> there<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> whole<00:02:29.240> time<00:02:29.300> which<00:02:29.900> was

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
was up there the whole time which was

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
was up there the whole time which was
really<00:02:30.680> really<00:02:30.920> stressful<00:02:31.370> because<00:02:31.819> everyone

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
really really stressful because everyone

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.090 
really really stressful because everyone
could<00:02:32.660> watch<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.080> i<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.290> doing<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.920> i<00:02:33.950> had

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
could watch what i was doing and i had

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.370 
could watch what i was doing and i had
to<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.340> really<00:02:35.090> careful<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.660> my<00:02:35.840> moves<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
to be really careful with my moves and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.660 
to be really careful with my moves and
it<00:02:36.440> made<00:02:36.590> me<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.800> little<00:02:36.860> bit<00:02:37.130> self-conscious

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
it made me a little bit self-conscious

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.430 
it made me a little bit self-conscious
at<00:02:38.030> first<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.420> wasn't<00:02:38.600> used<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.930> all<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> lights

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
at first I wasn't used to all the lights

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.100 
at first I wasn't used to all the lights
and<00:02:39.709> all<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> cameras<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.180> got<00:02:41.900> accustomed

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and all the cameras but I got accustomed

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.020 
and all the cameras but I got accustomed
to<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.620> very<00:02:42.800> fast<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.580> think<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.880> actually

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to it very fast and I think it actually

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.940 
to it very fast and I think it actually
helped<00:02:44.510> me<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> end<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.680> number

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
helped me in the end to be that number

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949 
helped me in the end to be that number
one<00:02:46.099> seed<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> whole<00:02:46.670> time<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.599> you're

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
one seed the whole time and you're

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.899 
one seed the whole time and you're
actually<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> youngest<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.549> not<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
actually one of the youngest if not the

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:50.500 
actually one of the youngest if not the
youngest

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
youngest

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.199 
youngest
the<00:02:50.780> competitors<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:52.010> did<00:02:52.189> that<00:02:52.370> feel<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:53.030> mean

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
the competitors how did that feel I mean

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.880 
the competitors how did that feel I mean
you<00:02:53.450> know<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.599> would<00:02:53.810> think<00:02:53.840> video<00:02:54.439> gamers

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you know you would think video gamers

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.399 
you know you would think video gamers
would<00:02:55.069> be<00:02:55.250> your<00:02:56.120> age<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.959> actually<00:02:57.140> found

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
would be your age but you actually found

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.369 
would be your age but you actually found
that<00:02:57.560> they<00:02:57.650> were<00:02:57.680> older<00:02:58.099> right<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.870> did<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> found

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
that they were older right I did I found

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.619 
that they were older right I did I found
them<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.799> be<00:03:00.829> much<00:03:01.129> older<00:03:01.400> actually<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.420> most

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
them to be much older actually and most

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.300 
them to be much older actually and most
of<00:03:02.780> them<00:03:02.900> were<00:03:02.959> professionals<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:03.980> mean<00:03:04.159> they

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
of them were professionals I mean they

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.699 
of them were professionals I mean they
were<00:03:04.370> lawyers<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.329> bankers<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:06.049> pharmacists

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
were lawyers and bankers and pharmacists

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.800 
were lawyers and bankers and pharmacists
they<00:03:06.860> really<00:03:07.459> weren't<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.390> crowd<00:03:08.569> that<00:03:08.750> I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
they really weren't the crowd that I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.960 
they really weren't the crowd that I
expected<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.409> be<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.709> surprisingly<00:03:10.640> enough

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
expected to be and surprisingly enough

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.300 
expected to be and surprisingly enough
it<00:03:11.239> was<00:03:11.420> more<00:03:11.629> girls<00:03:11.989> than<00:03:12.349> guys<00:03:12.409> I<00:03:13.010> really

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it was more girls than guys I really

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.819 
it was more girls than guys I really
expected<00:03:13.549> there<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:13.970> be<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.480> lot<00:03:15.110> more<00:03:15.140> guys

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
expected there to be a lot more guys

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.680 
expected there to be a lot more guys
because<00:03:16.159> it<00:03:16.280> was<00:03:16.370> video<00:03:16.609> games<00:03:16.879> but<00:03:17.420> really

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
because it was video games but really

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.080 
because it was video games but really
because<00:03:18.290> this<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.620> casual<00:03:19.159> gaming<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.819> not

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because this is casual gaming it's not

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.179 
because this is casual gaming it's not
like<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.720> hardcore<00:03:21.200> video<00:03:21.530> games<00:03:21.829> which<00:03:22.069> i

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
like the hardcore video games which i

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.360 
like the hardcore video games which i
think<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.670> appeals<00:03:23.450> more<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.370> my

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
think that appeals more to my

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.610 
think that appeals more to my
demographic<00:03:26.090> which<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.450> more<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.989> younger

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
demographic which is more the younger

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.240 
demographic which is more the younger
generation<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.549> mostly<00:03:29.480> guys<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:30.260> well<00:03:30.560> but

this is more the very casual games that
are<00:03:35.359> very<00:03:35.540> simple<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.319> understand<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.280> rules

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519
