sure that the car is secure so you need

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
sure that the car is secure so you need
to<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.739> sure<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.070> handbrake<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> fully

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090

pulled<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:51.090> gears<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pulled up all the way and the gears are

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.830 
pulled up all the way and the gears are
in<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.230> cool<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.039> start<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> engine

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
in you cool so when we start the engine

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
in you cool so when we start the engine
the<00:00:54.840> car<00:00:55.050> isn't<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> shoot<00:00:55.949> off<00:00:56.219> in

the car isn't going to shoot off in
first<00:00:57.180> gear<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> handbrake<00:00:59.430> secures<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
first gear so the handbrake secures the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
first gear so the handbrake secures the
two<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.230> wheels<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.370> gonna<00:01:02.489> roll

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
two back wheels so we're not gonna roll

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.560 
two back wheels so we're not gonna roll
anywhere<00:01:03.120> either

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
anywhere either

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
anywhere either
okay<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.369> next<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.909> adjust<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.720> seat

mirrors<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.489> left<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.970> right<00:04:03.150> now

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
mirrors on the left and the right now

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.650 
mirrors on the left and the right now
the<00:04:04.110> exterior<00:04:04.860> mirrors<00:04:05.209> differ<00:04:06.209> slightly

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
the exterior mirrors differ slightly

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.070 
the exterior mirrors differ slightly
from<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.820> interior<00:04:08.820> mirror<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.630> interior

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
from the interior mirror the interior

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.460 
from the interior mirror the interior
mirror<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:11.340> flat<00:04:11.640> mirror<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.050> gives<00:04:13.290> a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
mirror is a flat mirror so this gives a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.979 
mirror is a flat mirror so this gives a
true<00:04:13.709> picture<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.220> what's<00:04:14.610> behind<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.810> can

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
true picture of what's behind so you can

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.610 
true picture of what's behind so you can
judge<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.680> distance<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:18.209> car<00:04:18.450> behind<00:04:18.620> for

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
judge the distance of the car behind for

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.920 
judge the distance of the car behind for
instance<00:04:20.040> but<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.000> exterior<00:04:21.330> mirrors<00:04:21.780> a

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
instance but the exterior mirrors a

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.159 
instance but the exterior mirrors a
slightly<00:04:22.410> curved<00:04:22.789> they're<00:04:23.789> convex<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:24.990> what

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
slightly curved they're convex so what

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.330 
slightly curved they're convex so what
this<00:04:25.289> does

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
this does

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.220 
this does
it<00:04:26.520> gives<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.060> wide<00:04:27.240> field<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.660> vision<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.020> you

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
it gives a wide field of vision so you

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.020 
it gives a wide field of vision so you
can<00:04:28.380> actually<00:04:28.530> see<00:04:28.949> more<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.850> makes

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
can actually see more but it makes

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.210 
can actually see more but it makes
things<00:04:30.330> appear<00:04:30.900> smaller<00:04:31.530> than<00:04:31.949> they<00:04:32.100> actually

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
things appear smaller than they actually

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.710 
things appear smaller than they actually
are<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.639> makes<00:04:35.820> things<00:04:36.000> appear<00:04:36.210> further

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
are so it makes things appear further

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.810 
are so it makes things appear further
away<00:04:37.080> than<00:04:37.320> they<00:04:37.470> actually<00:04:37.590> are<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.669> you're

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
away than they actually are so if you're

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.670 
away than they actually are so if you're
driving<00:04:39.330> along<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.990> you're<00:04:40.229> changing<00:04:40.650> lanes

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
driving along and you're changing lanes

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.890 
driving along and you're changing lanes
and<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.580> checking<00:04:42.060> your<00:04:42.150> white<00:04:42.330> marrow<00:04:42.570> about

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
and you checking your white marrow about

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.689 
and you checking your white marrow about
checking<00:04:43.199> your<00:04:43.320> rearview<00:04:43.620> mirror<00:04:44.040> you<00:04:44.220> may

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
checking your rearview mirror you may

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.360 
checking your rearview mirror you may
think<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.300> safe<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.750> move<00:04:45.900> across

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
think that it's safe to move across

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.950 
think that it's safe to move across
whereas<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.550> car<00:04:47.760> is<00:04:47.970> actually<00:04:48.389> right<00:04:48.780> behind

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
whereas the car is actually right behind

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.230 
whereas the car is actually right behind
you<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.040> need<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.250> be<00:04:50.370> aware<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.639> this<00:04:50.880> and

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
you do you need to be aware of this and

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.200 
you do you need to be aware of this and
your<00:04:51.600> general<00:04:52.470> driving<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:53.639> lean<00:04:53.850> now<00:04:54.060> to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
your general driving this lean now to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.850 
your general driving this lean now to
adjust<00:04:54.510> these<00:04:54.630> mirrors<00:04:54.990> on<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.260> tourists<00:04:55.680> X

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
adjust these mirrors on the tourists X

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.680 
adjust these mirrors on the tourists X
we<00:04:56.370> have<00:04:56.550> this<00:04:56.729> dial<00:04:57.150> here<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:59.700> to<00:05:00.210> adjust<00:05:00.540> the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
we have this dial here so to adjust the
