00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.730
 I did not specifically say weekly 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.619
 because one week all the same I 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210

 already said but now I will try 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.629
 catch up since this 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.110
 I decided to change the format a little bit 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.850

 this please comments so on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 This week I played this composition 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.350
 I want to say about this part of it 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 certainly not a masterpiece he did not drag me 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 in all matches 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 but this one here is a very kovacic guy 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.680
 cool electronics art now it also 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.450
 apnuli general upgrade went to him only 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 favor you just look at his stats 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.409
 they are all green all so beautiful 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 beautiful 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 here is huan cuadrado everyone already knows 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.320
 how cool is he a bunch of defenders 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
 kusil not Smalling 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.119
 also quite good doha i'm 85 in general 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 beautiful but these two guys on the left 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 flank the sea ​​with white and content 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 They were necessary for teamwork in Hazar 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 In principle, they also showed themselves very 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 even not bad well go offended as 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.220
 opornika is of course a kind 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.290
 experiment but experiment 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.939
 rather failed than failed and now 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.119
 it's time to talk about the three main 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.850
 actors on my desk first 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 I will probably tell you about Freddie Guarin 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.600
 because I was waiting for a warrior uniform to me 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 really like this player 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.820
 he has some kind of divine long 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 shot of him his usual card blow power 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.060
 91 at his info card as we see 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.729
 the force of the blow already 96 and he just could not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.410
 walk past my show 3 in form of it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.270
 the statue is very good very 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.590
 balanced on the card can be seen even 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.230
 eighty two eighty two 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.060
 eighty two eighty three that is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.190
 very balanced good stats 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920
 very cool he is a shoemaker I decided 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.260
 try it on cfd position exactly 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.690
 because of his long shot of because of his strength 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.550
 hitting me was very interesting on 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.100
 how much info card plays better 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.709
 than usual i can honestly say guys 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.959
 his long sho I didn’t like you 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.670
 in my humble opinion usual 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.819
 speak beat much better and more 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.739
 sighting than its inform version is related 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.230
 Is it with the fact that its force of impact has become 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.750
 higher and he began to beat not so precisely but 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.160
 He heads I started not very many do not 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.319
 I can say that he scored a lot 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.720
 Goals gave a lot of assists 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.959
 but overall a very good strong guy 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.670
 physics 87 will only benefit him 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.590
 this made us not played on cfd 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.570
 I tried it and on the position of the chains on 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.570
 cp positions I liked him a lot 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.329
 more well let's summarize by 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.209
 Freddie Guarin y I put him 8 points 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.730
 out of 10 basically such a cheap replacement 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.269
 the field where a very good strong guy 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.650
 in the center of the field he will come in handy the most 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.780
 brave of you may try 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.390
 put it in the support zone because 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.359
 his physics is supposed to help him 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.250
 take the ball and 69 but defending on the other 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.380
 countries should dissuade you from this 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.239
 can wait until the end of the week he 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.790
 cheaper and then you can buy it 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.320
 and try the second I will tell 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.329
 will be wah 2 in vain 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.790
 playing bordeaux this guy in position 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.680
 central attacking midfielder on 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.230
 his cards we see are very weak but not 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.290
 depressing stats are not bad in principle 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.840
 dribbling good ps for 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.239
 quick whole them food visas to us 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.209
 says that its main chips are so 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.760
 let's say it's speed dribbling and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.349
 technical three damn the so-called not 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.659
 I can say that I am delighted with the game 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.730
 this guy in midfield due to his 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.450
 he dribbled me a couple of times 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.120
 penalties 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.000
 gave a good transfer to my guarin 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.810
 he did not hit me so let's say very much 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.049
 The average player is not bad as something 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.620
 like this so i put him 6 points out 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.320
 ten 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.759
 so let's say gave him a yellow light if you 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.400
 interesting to play for some 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.229
 original in form of plus here again 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.720
 the same change of position compared to the usual 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.120
 card you can try this 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.330
 guy but I don't think he will impress you 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.940
 Well, in conclusion, I will tell you about Kris 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.900
 Smolin g inform defender card 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.570
 Manchester United 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.820
 it turned out the guys are very suitable for 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.740
 his statam you see that 79 speed for 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.070
 central defender especially with such 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.310
 as tall as 192 centimeters it is soft 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.539
 let's say fucking also we see that 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:00.650
 it has 86 steadin and 82 slider topil 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.659
 that is it tackles 82 and and the selection in 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.180
 upright so let's say position too 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.760
 very good and I want to say that 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.440
 all these stats guys 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.419
 justified in full this is my new 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.110
 favorite among in form of defenders and 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.169
 started singing 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.449
 along with ryan went cross by the way they 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.039
 both Englishmen want to point out 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.380
 he is really very good tackles 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.030
 very good speed very good 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.710
 league 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.750
 apoel that is this card is very good 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.120
 very good defender very good 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.479
 nationality he has and perfect 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.550
 links and many other links to the top 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.000
 just plays divinely rising 192 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.990
 speed 80 no complaints at all 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.710
 most likely if I can't remember 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.349
 his flaws I did not notice them and so 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.990
 total chris smolling my score him nine 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.789
 and a half points out of 10 on the floor points 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.650
 I lowered his assessment solely because 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.750
 his thief crate of medium medium 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.539
 if he had a work raid and low 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.100
 high with high on defense then he 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.870
 would get all 10 points out of 10 from me 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.910
 Chris Smolling recommend to buy 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.950
 guys very cheap very good 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.660
 defenders honestly don't understand why 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.640
 he is so cheap and the speed is good and 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.560
 nationality league in general no matter we 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.840
 that's not all about it 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.790
