00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
it's really fun I think it gives me a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.490 
it's really fun I think it gives me a
new<00:03:12.140> impression<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.890> Makia<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:14.660> think<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.350> I

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
new impression of Makia I think like I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.470 
new impression of Makia I think like I
always<00:03:15.800> expected<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.400> Kea<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:16.940> more<00:03:17.210> of<00:03:17.300> an

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
always expected a Kea to be more of an

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.260 
always expected a Kea to be more of an
economical<00:03:18.260> like<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.860> car<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.130> drive<00:03:19.460> for

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
economical like a car you drive for

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.070 
economical like a car you drive for
college<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.400> never<00:03:22.640> expected<00:03:22.820> yet<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.870> have

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
college but I never expected yet to have

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.630 
college but I never expected yet to have
a<00:03:25.030> luxury<00:03:26.030> line<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.770> p90

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
a luxury line that like p90

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.970 
a luxury line that like p90
I<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> memory<00:03:29.480> profiles<00:03:30.020> yeah<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.890> was

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
I like the memory profiles yeah that was

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.380 
I like the memory profiles yeah that was
a<00:03:31.010> lot<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.220> fact<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:31.610> you're<00:03:31.700> gonna<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.270> your

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
a lot of fact that you're gonna to your

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.880 
a lot of fact that you're gonna to your
profile<00:03:32.750> that's<00:03:33.080> really<00:03:33.380> that's<00:03:33.770> really

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
profile that's really that's really

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.640 
profile that's really that's really
great<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:34.940> like<00:03:35.090> people<00:03:35.240> share<00:03:35.540> cars<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
great it's like people share cars and

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350 
great it's like people share cars and
like<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:37.010> just<00:03:37.250> totally<00:03:37.460> make<00:03:37.730> sense<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.150> think

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
like it just totally make sense I think

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360 
like it just totally make sense I think
sitting<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.020> back<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.410> was<00:03:39.530> certainly<00:03:39.830> more

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
sitting in back it was certainly more

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.820 
sitting in back it was certainly more
than<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.670> typical<00:03:40.970> luxury<00:03:41.480> car<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.560> would<00:03:42.680> not

the navigation on you they showed you
where<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.139> go<00:05:45.320> in<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.590> end<00:05:45.949> that<00:05:46.490> windshield

like look down or try to find other
things<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:50.900> I<00:05:50.930> thought<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.289> was<00:05:51.380> really

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
things so I thought that was really

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500 
things so I thought that was really
giving<00:05:51.830> in<00:05:51.949> having<00:05:52.669> been<00:05:52.850> having<00:05:53.389> the

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510

giving in having been having the
reflection<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:54.350> dashboard<00:05:55.039> a<00:05:55.280> direction

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
reflection on the dashboard a direction

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.689 
reflection on the dashboard a direction
and<00:05:56.210> speed<00:05:56.389> is<00:05:57.010> amazing<00:05:58.010> I've<00:05:58.130> never<00:05:58.190> seen

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
and speed is amazing I've never seen

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.870 
and speed is amazing I've never seen
that<00:05:58.910> first<00:05:59.419> of<00:05:59.600> all<00:05:59.750> and<00:06:00.110> then<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:01.669> other

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
that first of all and then the other

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.920 
that first of all and then the other
thing<00:06:02.410> was<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.919> light<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.760> lights<00:06:05.090> along<00:06:05.630> the

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
thing was the light the lights along the

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.210 
thing was the light the lights along the
sides<00:06:06.789> you<00:06:07.789> know<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.120> then<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:09.410> small<00:06:09.800> screen

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
sides you know and then the small screen

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.810 
sides you know and then the small screen
that<00:06:10.970> showed<00:06:11.360> you<00:06:11.740> how<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.800> air<00:06:12.919> flows<00:06:13.100> in<00:06:13.729> the

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:21.279 
that showed you how the air flows in the
car<00:06:14.120> I<00:06:14.479> thought<00:06:14.810> that<00:06:14.960> was<00:06:15.050> really

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.349
