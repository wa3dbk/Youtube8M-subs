which<00:03:07.680> I've<00:03:07.860> noticed<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.430> lot<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.640> Asian<00:03:09.150> skin

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
which I've noticed a lot of Asian skin

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.330 
which I've noticed a lot of Asian skin
care<00:03:09.660> products<00:03:09.990> have<00:03:10.140> collagen<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> like

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
care products have collagen in it like

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.400 
care products have collagen in it like
Asian<00:03:11.940> people<00:03:11.970> usually<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.720> really<00:03:12.900> good

Asian people usually have really good

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.830 
Asian people usually have really good
skin<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.010> i'm<00:03:14.130> guessing<00:03:14.400> collagen<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> good

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
skin so i'm guessing collagen is a good

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
to be as clear as I can because

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.180 
to be as clear as I can because
basically<00:05:48.120> like<00:05:48.570> if<00:05:48.750> your<00:05:48.900> face<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.320> clear<00:05:49.770> you

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
basically like if your face it clear you

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.760 
basically like if your face it clear you
don't<00:05:50.310> have<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.760> wear<00:05:51.000> as<00:05:51.240> heavy<00:05:51.600> face<00:05:52.470> makeup

don't have to wear as heavy face makeup

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.160 
don't have to wear as heavy face makeup
so<00:05:53.190> if<00:05:53.460> you<00:05:53.730> can<00:05:54.060> prevent<00:05:54.510> wearing<00:05:54.990> foundation
