00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
removing it from the water if you're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.310 
removing it from the water if you're
going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> boil<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> bake

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

going to boil it but we're going to bake
this<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:27.090> way<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> by

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
this one the way I like to do it is by

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.950 
this one the way I like to do it is by
putting<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> nice<00:00:31.679> roasting<00:00:32.130> pan<00:00:32.690> but<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
putting it in a nice roasting pan but of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420 
putting it in a nice roasting pan but of
course<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.440> no<00:00:34.559> overlap<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.280> won't

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
course there's no overlap so it won't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
course there's no overlap so it won't
drip<00:00:35.579> into<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.940> oven<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:37.020> rack<00:00:37.260> elevated

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
drip into your oven on a rack elevated

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
drip into your oven on a rack elevated
from<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> bottom<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> pan<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.899> not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
from the bottom of the pan so it's not

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
from the bottom of the pan so it's not
direct<00:00:40.350> heat<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> we'll<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.309> searing<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
direct heat it so we'll be searing and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.190 
direct heat it so we'll be searing and
get<00:00:42.059> stuck<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.020> burn

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
get stuck and all of that and burn

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.889 
get stuck and all of that and burn
scores<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.820> rack<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.510> nice<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
scores so the rack is kind of nice and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
scores so the rack is kind of nice and
then<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.500> add<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:46.890> water<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> bottom<00:00:48.059> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
then I add some water to the bottom of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
then I add some water to the bottom of
this<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.930> keeps<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.530> drippings

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this and that just keeps the drippings

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470 
this and that just keeps the drippings
from<00:00:50.070> scorching<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.789> smoking<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
from scorching and smoking up your

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.729 
from scorching and smoking up your
kitchen<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> little<00:00:51.989> bit<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> moisture<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
kitchen a little bit of moisture in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
kitchen a little bit of moisture in the
oven<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.840> kind<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
oven at the same time is kind of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.529 
oven at the same time is kind of
beneficial<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.879> ham<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.300> take

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
beneficial to this so this ham will take

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.260 
beneficial to this so this ham will take
about<00:00:57.840> four<00:00:58.289> hours<00:00:58.469> probably<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.280> 325<00:01:00.210> degrees

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
about four hours probably at 325 degrees

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889 
about four hours probably at 325 degrees
about<00:01:00.870> 20<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.649> 25<00:01:02.100> minutes<00:01:02.309> per<00:01:03.059> pound<00:01:03.329> we'll

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
about 20 to 25 minutes per pound we'll

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.830 
about 20 to 25 minutes per pound we'll
put<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> oven<00:01:04.909> I'll<00:01:05.909> check<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> maybe

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
put it in the oven I'll check it maybe

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
put it in the oven I'll check it maybe
after<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.320> hour<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.770> add<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.520> more<00:01:08.670> water

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
after an hour or so add some more water

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
after an hour or so add some more water
if<00:01:09.060> need<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.290> keep<00:01:10.500> checking<00:01:10.650> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
if need be and just keep checking it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.850 
if need be and just keep checking it
over<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> course<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> four<00:01:11.729> hours
