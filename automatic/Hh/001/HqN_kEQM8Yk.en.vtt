00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
and in a second there you go you see it
now<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> weird<00:01:06.869> thing<00:01:07.080> about<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.619> once

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
now the weird thing about is that once

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
now the weird thing about is that once
when<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.659> bar<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.689> loading<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> loading<00:01:10.890> bar

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
when the bar is loading the loading bar

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.990 
when the bar is loading the loading bar
at<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.580> top<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.150> keeps<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.200> space<00:01:14.070> between<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
at the top it keeps a space between the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
at the top it keeps a space between the
bar<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.869> status<00:01:15.900> bar<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> looks<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
bar and the status bar so it looks a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
bar and the status bar so it looks a
little<00:01:17.700> funky<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.360> after<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> finishes

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
little funky but after it finishes

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
little funky but after it finishes
loading<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> loading<00:01:20.640> bar<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
loading in the loading bar then you can

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
loading in the loading bar then you can
see<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.500> supposed<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> work<00:01:22.950> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
see it how it's supposed to work just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060 
see it how it's supposed to work just
like<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.729> status<00:01:24.420> bars<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> top<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
like this status bars at the top it is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
like this status bars at the top it is
translucent<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.150> through<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
translucent you can see through it and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
translucent you can see through it and
it<00:01:28.290> works<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.740> much<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.400> advertised

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it works pretty much just as advertised

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.359 
it works pretty much just as advertised
but<00:01:30.570> again<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.040> bar<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but again when that little bar is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
but again when that little bar is
loading<00:01:32.820> you'll<00:01:33.240> notice<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.900> gap

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
loading you'll notice that little gap

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
loading you'll notice that little gap
there<00:01:34.350> looks<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> little<00:01:35.280> strange<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there looks a little strange with the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.429 
there looks a little strange with the
translucent<00:01:38.189> status<00:01:38.549> bar<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
