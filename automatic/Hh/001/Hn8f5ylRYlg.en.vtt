so<00:00:11.050> one<00:00:11.350> of<00:00:11.380> the<00:00:11.500> next<00:00:11.650> things<00:00:11.980> I'll<00:00:12.190> cover

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
so one of the next things I'll cover

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.240 
so one of the next things I'll cover
this<00:00:13.090> prospector<00:00:13.690> jess<00:00:13.870> again<00:00:14.200> hunting<00:00:15.100> for

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
this prospector jess again hunting for

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.760 
this prospector jess again hunting for
gold<00:00:15.370> calm<00:00:16.110> one<00:00:17.110> of<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.260> next<00:00:17.410> things<00:00:17.530> we're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
gold calm one of the next things we're

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.710 
gold calm one of the next things we're
going<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:17.920> cover<00:00:18.160> here<00:00:18.430> is<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:19.090> concept<00:00:19.330> of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
going to cover here is the concept of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.440 
going to cover here is the concept of
sampling<00:00:20.170> which<00:00:20.920> basically<00:00:21.730> falls<00:00:22.060> out<00:00:22.270> of

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
sampling which basically falls out of

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.510 
sampling which basically falls out of
that<00:00:22.630> discovery<00:00:23.200> we<00:00:23.500> have<00:00:23.710> about<00:00:23.980> how<00:00:24.130> streams

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
that discovery we have about how streams

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.689 
that discovery we have about how streams
work<00:00:24.820> and<00:00:25.119> remember<00:00:25.780> helical<00:00:26.350> flow<00:00:26.699> but

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
work and remember helical flow but

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.090 
work and remember helical flow but
basically<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:29.199> want<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.470> do<00:00:29.590> what's<00:00:29.800> called<00:00:29.949> a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
basically you want to do what's called a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.059 
basically you want to do what's called a
sample<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:31.539> places<00:00:31.990> where<00:00:32.140> you<00:00:32.259> sample<00:00:32.859> are

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:33.069 
sample the places where you sample are

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:35.970 
sample the places where you sample are
these<00:00:34.019> concentrations<00:00:35.019> called<00:00:35.319> pay<00:00:35.559> streaks

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
these concentrations called pay streaks

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.880 
these concentrations called pay streaks
you're<00:00:36.789> looking<00:00:37.210> for<00:00:37.480> where<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.440> pay<00:00:38.620> streak

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
you're looking for where the pay streak

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.029 
you're looking for where the pay streak
is<00:00:39.069> that<00:00:39.399> it's<00:00:39.519> highest<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.379> when<00:00:41.920> you're

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
is that it's highest so when you're

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.369 
is that it's highest so when you're
looking<00:00:42.370> at<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.579> streamflow

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
looking at the streamflow

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.989 
looking at the streamflow
the<00:00:44.379> material<00:00:44.859> sweeps<00:00:45.190> as<00:00:45.489> we<00:00:45.609> talked<00:00:45.850> about

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
the material sweeps as we talked about

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:48.090 
the material sweeps as we talked about
before<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.899> material<00:00:47.319> sweeps<00:00:47.589> into<00:00:47.859> these

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
before the material sweeps into these

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.910 
before the material sweeps into these
bars<00:00:48.909> and<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:50.519> inside<00:00:51.519> points<00:00:52.799> where<00:00:53.799> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
bars and and inside points where the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.680 
bars and and inside points where the
slow<00:00:54.219> water<00:00:54.460> start<00:00:54.969> where<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.299> water<00:00:55.449> just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
slow water start where the water just

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.450 
slow water start where the water just
starts<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.109> slow<00:00:56.379> down<00:00:56.559> it's<00:00:56.859> turning<00:00:57.309> over

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
starts to slow down it's turning over

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.459 
starts to slow down it's turning over
and<00:00:57.729> over<00:00:57.909> as<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.149> turns<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.449> corner<00:00:58.569> and<00:00:59.049> it

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
and over as it turns the corner and it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.169 
and over as it turns the corner and it
sweeps<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.010> gold<00:01:00.190> into<00:01:00.489> those<00:01:00.639> nice<00:01:00.850> little

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
sweeps the gold into those nice little

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.989 
sweeps the gold into those nice little
streaks<00:01:01.479> you<00:01:02.440> want<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.679> start<00:01:02.979> sampling<00:01:03.459> at

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
streaks you want to start sampling at

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.389 
streaks you want to start sampling at
those<00:01:04.379> points<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.469> bars<00:01:05.649> as<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.009> talked<00:01:06.280> about

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
those points and bars as we talked about

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.100 
those points and bars as we talked about
a<00:01:06.789> sample<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:07.930> simply<00:01:08.469> a<00:01:08.789> hole<00:01:09.789> that<00:01:10.539> you<00:01:10.719> start

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
a sample is simply a hole that you start

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.209 
a sample is simply a hole that you start
toward<00:01:11.890> bedrock<00:01:13.500> usually<00:01:14.500> best<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.950> try<00:01:15.159> to

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
toward bedrock usually best to try to

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.709 
toward bedrock usually best to try to
sample<00:01:15.609> in<00:01:15.909> areas<00:01:16.180> where<00:01:16.359> you're<00:01:16.539> pretty

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
sample in areas where you're pretty

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.420 
sample in areas where you're pretty
close<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:16.990> bedrock<00:01:17.320> or<00:01:17.740> you're<00:01:18.130> going<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.340> be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
close to bedrock or you're going to be

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.899 
close to bedrock or you're going to be
digging<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.850> very<00:01:19.090> deep<00:01:19.329> hole<00:01:20.399> it's<00:01:21.399> okay<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.729> do

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
digging a very deep hole it's okay to do

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.149 
digging a very deep hole it's okay to do
that<00:01:22.119> if<00:01:22.630> there<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.229> pay<00:01:23.590> streak<00:01:23.799> because

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
that if there is a pay streak because

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.920 
that if there is a pay streak because
you'll<00:01:24.579> see<00:01:24.789> there's<00:01:25.000> plenty<00:01:25.180> of<00:01:25.420> gold<00:01:25.689> you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
you'll see there's plenty of gold you

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.109 
you'll see there's plenty of gold you
want<00:01:26.079> to<00:01:26.140> be<00:01:26.200> careful<00:01:26.500> though<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:26.979> as<00:01:27.820> these

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
want to be careful though as as these

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.810 
want to be careful though as as these
things<00:01:28.390> get<00:01:28.719> deeper<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.799> sides<00:01:30.130> can<00:01:30.429> collapse

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
things get deeper the sides can collapse

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.370 
things get deeper the sides can collapse
and<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.210> be<00:01:31.299> dangerous<00:01:31.719> so<00:01:31.750> be<00:01:31.990> careful

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and it can be dangerous so be careful

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.529 
and it can be dangerous so be careful
out<00:01:32.469> there<00:01:33.240> also

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
out there also

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.050 
out there also
it's<00:01:34.869> not<00:01:35.140> wise<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.439> dig<00:01:35.920> underneath<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.670> bank

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
it's not wise to dig underneath a bank

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.120 
it's not wise to dig underneath a bank
or<00:01:37.299> underneath<00:01:37.960> dirt<00:01:38.380> because<00:01:38.799> it<00:01:38.950> can

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
or underneath dirt because it can

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.649 
or underneath dirt because it can
collapse<00:01:39.399> in<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.789> top<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
collapse in on top of you and and that

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.840 
collapse in on top of you and and that
would<00:01:41.020> be<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> problem<00:01:41.609> it<00:01:42.609> can<00:01:42.670> be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
would be a problem it can be

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.029 
would be a problem it can be
life-threatening

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
life-threatening

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.419 
life-threatening
so<00:01:45.039> sampling<00:01:45.880> though<00:01:46.469> precedes<00:01:47.469> in<00:01:47.770> each<00:01:48.249> of

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
so sampling though precedes in each of

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.560 
so sampling though precedes in each of
these<00:01:48.520> areas<00:01:48.579> in<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:50.079> very<00:01:50.460> methodical<00:01:51.570> fashion

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
these areas in a very methodical fashion

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.779 
these areas in a very methodical fashion
so<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.229> want<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.619> start<00:01:53.829> tracking<00:01:54.100> how<00:01:54.520> much

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
so you want to start tracking how much

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.330 
so you want to start tracking how much
gold<00:01:55.060> you're<00:01:55.270> finding<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.719> your<00:01:55.749> pan<00:01:56.340> how

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
gold you're finding in your pan how

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.039 
gold you're finding in your pan how
often<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.969> gold<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.359> found

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.780 

so<00:02:04.049> how<00:02:04.229> much<00:02:04.470> gold<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.979> find<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.400> Eve<00:02:05.490> each

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
so how much gold you find and Eve each

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.499 
so how much gold you find and Eve each
pan<00:02:06.119> how<00:02:07.020> often<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.069> found<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.420> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pan how often that's found and then you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.780 
pan how often that's found and then you
want<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> basically<00:02:10.220> use<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> information

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
want to basically use that information

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.080 
want to basically use that information
to<00:02:12.300> predict<00:02:12.840> where<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> gold<00:02:13.410> will<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:14.090> you're

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to predict where the gold will go you're
