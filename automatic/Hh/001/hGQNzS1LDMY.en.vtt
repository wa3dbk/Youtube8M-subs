00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.269
 all the victory 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.740
 all matches are complicated especially 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.660
 when we played against a team that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 is the interval that takes action 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.270
 who were there the championships you are 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.070
 with a very good organization especially 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.140
 then there's inherently difficult defensive 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 especially because we were able to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.340
 given a lot against the acquired tac 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.790
 counter attack the first metal can 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 we have appeared against a symbol of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:47.969
 put and summer reindeer and issue 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.649
 a good thing me a lot of metz 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.980
 we did not have beautiful dog it is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.840
 loudly I had it take to the prince on 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 takes from these three points which are very 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.710
 important for the end the championship 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.049
 to turn her over the league head and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 I'm glad that maybe the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.270
 sometimes you can not always 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 to play 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.979
 with a fantastic game you have me 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.140
 to be unusual desiccated to win is 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.610
 true that the last two meters of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.869
 championships ahead were not playing well but 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.780
 we won against strong team and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.250
 I will notice that this team has 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.229
 out of 10 matches he won after 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.840
 difficult times I am but what he 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.680
 played last time while hat 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.280
 this team 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.479
 Cauchy is today 11 jan aps a 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.479
 played a fantastic football 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.780
 she had injury to the ischio must 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:09.229
 watch brands 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.250
 what happens to me all 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.650
 trades of all the injured 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.200
 I'm worried because as already has 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.940
 theaters of very important players 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.840
 for name so I hope he's going 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.840
 recover at 8 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:35.400
 no I do not think you played against 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:40.049
 very tight team it's hard to 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.549
 find space at cg no I was playing 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.799
 a lot especially the first half time 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.569
 not dangerous but when not hide 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.849
 it was hard to be finding 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.150
 space 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:55.920
 I think this team he has the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.910
 quality of the counterattack is that you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.590
 do not have the opportunity to score quickly 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.519
 in the most difficult match before and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.519
 after 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.030
 no i'm not worried because 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.270
 I hope the next ten matches 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.460
 we will win it twice I do not 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.380
 am not worried 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.150
 jade and trades are not 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.910
 easy because you play against 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.820
 teams that want to come here to do 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.590
 the best and all the wheat andi 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.270
 foot because the fantastic femed this 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.620
 evening she showed what was the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.000
 best team he has benefited from 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:01.010
 play at the park the facs and by and the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.810
 win it's good no I'm mostly 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.460
 proud of my players i am proud of my 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.480
 players heal themselves just miss the 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.930
 result but we were higher than psg 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.960
 in all areas tactically at 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.980
 athletic level at the game level 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.140
 unfortunately we have cashed a 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.050
 goal on a on a csc we hit the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.450
 post and the balloon did not come in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.340
 we missed a bit of success but 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.410
 it's a reassuring defeat have there 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.390
 we play all our matches until 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.400
 the end of the season like tonight we're going 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.290
 more by losing a lot so 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:47.419
 so here we must we can build 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:48.259
 on on the delivery tonight I 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.789
 believe that I have nothing else to add 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.419
 everyone saw it so it's not the 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.419
 to say more 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.190
 essential is the provision of 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.750
 players that's what counts when we 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.440
 comes to paris even though we started a 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.880
 little shyly after we became confident 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.560
 we managed in the second period to have 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.180
 a lot the balloon laid a lot of 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.250
 problems to this psg team to get 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.860
 to provide opportunities 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.070
 here with a little more success this 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.440
 evening we would have at least taken 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.000
 a point if not more but here it is 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.320
 must look must look ahead and he 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.840
 do not need to lower the level 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.880
 of requirement especially in the future what 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.670
 account is to be able to 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.530
 reproduce this kind of performance that this 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:44.400
 will be the most important for the future 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:47.100
 for us no it's a reality by 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.450
 report to the rankings now here 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.550
 tonight we had a great match 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.800
 so that's what counts it proves that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.630
 we are still able to make beautiful 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 things in this championship he's far 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.710
 to be finished I think it remains 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.260
 sixteen games to play that must do 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.000
 48 points to distribute and so that's it 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.190
 let's be 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.289
 good like tonight and we'll be able to 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.029
 return 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:18.259
 this is towards European waters where we 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:20.149
 wants to be tonight it did not smile 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.559
 but again we need rather than 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.039
 to be defeatist it must be necessary 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:27.379
 Positive it is necessary to force this success 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.699
 by dint of good benefits like 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.619
 tonight's there's no reason that 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.860
 the wheel does not turn now 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:35.029
 we will have to be able to 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.430
 to rely on what has been good this 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.199
 evening there is really a good thing so much 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.689
 in our young players than in our 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.399
 managerial staff 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:46.330
 in the collective notion of 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:48.339
 the team so that's all for nothing 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.299
 pity ourselves on what is needed 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:50.379
 now it's winning the next 

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:52.919
 match is the next match this is the 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.919
 reception of troyes 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.789
 we have very well defended we knew 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.589
 that anyway here must be well 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.789
 defend and be very good and in 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:02.229
 the use of the ball in attack 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.489
 fast and then be able too 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:07.449
 to have moments of conservation 

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:09.279
 strong enough so as to sail to the 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.340
 deprive of balloons and then especially to everything 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.980
 made to 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.060
 to get opportunities and we 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.740
 know that this team does not have 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.110
 especially the habit of sharing the 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.250
 possession so it was also one to 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.500
 goals even though of course 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.500
 I would have preferred to mark tonight 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.120
 can honestly no matter what 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.410
 account is the losc is tonight 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.720
 Unfortunately, we did not take any 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.910
 points so we're going to be we're going to be in 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.260
 the urgency of points and it's this 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.020
 urgency that will not require 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.190
 put forward especially this is what he 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.870
 will have to put forward it's at the 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.130
 team performance and again a 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.729
 time to be able to reiterate what we have 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.530
 done tonight 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.729
 if we focus on the game and not 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.320
 on the issue I think it can be 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:53.350
 interesting for us for following the 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.350
 championship
