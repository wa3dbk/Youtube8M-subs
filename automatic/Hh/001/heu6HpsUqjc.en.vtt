 4 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.369
 Hello 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.500
 Today I show how easy it is 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.929
 Smith percent 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.989
 Front doors or at house doors 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 to set up a website based 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.019
 of the content management system or price 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.609
 the first thing I have to do is I have to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.840
 Percent log in first, but eroded 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.300
 I like that with which I select here the customer number and the password 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.060
 enter 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.500
 January the right one 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.310
 on the left edge 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.350
 and in the middle of my bed hosting at Kate and then finds this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.650
 Main navigation in the header of the called 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.090
 he showed 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 the first thing I have to do when I press a rempler 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 To perform a demolition installation is to log in a database 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.590
 I click data here in the break navigation on databases 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 we lack the knowledge of a set of databases have been created and I 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.600
 now another athlete under this line he is located one 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.670
 Great newsrooms and animals 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 I think so too 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.560
 Mimi entry 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.370
 Manage database 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.280
 if I have a pimple now 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.300
 and at the very bottom 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.440
 Dr 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.560
 that appearing screen I have the option of a new database 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 create for the usual 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.440
 I'll give the name Pokemon FIFA because I want to go today 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.130
 for a children's group called Put me Feel 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.050
 Liverpool is in the station so go 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.310
 to turn out in Gescher Philipp 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.729
 and just have to click on create 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.450
 get the feedback that this database 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.780
 So we created the database now 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 the next thing I have to do is install leaves myself 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.270
 and before I graduate from high school 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.659
 Mighty you misrepresent that that's why I take this too 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.989
 at out 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.569
 registered 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.010
 The directory also points to the right directory 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:19.460
 Voigt 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.489
 later 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.049
 want the World Press to install the Workplace time into it 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.579
 I thank you for leaving your head free 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.449
 kick off for the 1st 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.489
 and rather 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.489
 under point Domain assignments edit 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.420
 on the way then I see here 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.799
 a list of 2 mainstream 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.809
 my white that pretty much 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.649
 and visitors here the domain 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.229
 watch fake 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 and do not find her 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:55.539
 Iris m 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:01.229
 and that also shows the directory of DWD dolls missing enabled and that is 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.609
 also exactly what I want 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.579
 and this is not nothing else than he was first 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.870
 i have created a database second step i care about that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 this is showing my domain on the right directory 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.869
 and now I come to the third step 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:19.760
 by the way 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.989
 if I lead here in the book 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.650
 STA then takes up to 15 minutes to make these changes in the system 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.060
 and I would have to wait 15 minutes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.349
 to be sure 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.330
 this is my 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.410
 m2 men we will show the first correct directory 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.389
 you get it with you 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.639
 I am Dilla I am here 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.719
 Point scripts 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.010
 Scripts such as this mean the world applications approved by Scribd 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.930
 under 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.590
 concrete applications 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.179
 and find a list 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:56.249
 Einbeck applications the seas are made available from Cloud the 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:57.059
 Duty here 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.389
 The study can be very many 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.409
 punchy 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.739
 Schuler many others 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.019
 and I search in this list 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.949
 WordPress and drown 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.189
 found 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.189
 happy man on configure 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:18.060
 and who the Getrag is probing a domain on this is going to be Kristen Stewart at times 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:19.729
 should and from 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.659
 I'm looking for the domain 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.180
 is missing 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.580
 I probably will not find anywhere in the list 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.520
 for sure 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.650
 then I have a database because luckily I have already created mine 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.889
 I want group picture 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.159
 and Kaka on configuration start 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.759
 a no information coach not yet of success 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.240
 Papers criticize this via press enlisted and percent that 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.449
 do not have to change 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.699
 not as a request concert is automatically good points b 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.490
 selected because the domain on dolls fries points to the directory Red 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.889
 in the 2nd 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.350
 I want to remember a running name that I can easily remember 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.050
 pastor 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.870
 and next one 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.550
 Administrators email address I specify who in the n-standard email address 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.239
 and I bet on a title for the race this title can later 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.239
 relatively easy yet 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.169
 Gabriel for the moment 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.969
 Dolls are missing 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.409
 I do not have to change anything in the language settings 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.199
 on InStyle Zion 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.020
 finally offer 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.020
 and hope that everything works 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.729
 it will take a few moments now 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.710
 a database Wedels set up 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.910
 Ciardi directories are being copied documents and indeed now gets 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.620
 the feedback from the application has been successfully set up here 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.539
 they use the world a cn 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.909
 I want to feed the world application and therefore offers on this 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.020
 here we have 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.099
 a irritated words it wished me we see who squeezes in a close to the people 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.409

 everything works already we have a first for Haug here 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.240
 January and written on 28 September 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.030
 that looks good at the SC I now also want to test if I am in 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.389
 the administration environment can log in nicely 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.379
 wing 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.509
 to 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.600
 in drive b Pepy dash godparents mime added 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.999
 WP had

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:44.949

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.949
 Password and sign Kaka on 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.659
 but a wrong password 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.919
 second try 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.289
 I'll click 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.819
 Sign in 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.110
 and now appeal not life 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.289
 who likes women 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:02.559
 more 1 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.490
 logged in and have the opportunity 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.339
 Attia create items for the block 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.110
 Manage images in the media library 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.979
 I have the option left Prof others 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:20.180

 who sent the visitors to my blog posts and me 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.550
 then have a second box here 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.620
 a way to expand 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.290
 In my system, this is an increase to add functionalities around 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.430
 Adjust basic settings 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.000
 and we will still be with it 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.210
 At the moment, our goal was to spend more time 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.990
 only 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.840
 Percent it will install and fits is really really great 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.429
 gone fast and smoothly percent 

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:57.149
 and percent 

00:07:57.149 --> 00:08:01.009
 that is not all that wants to fit into this picture we wanted to speak 

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:05.289
 and 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:06.039
 that's huge
