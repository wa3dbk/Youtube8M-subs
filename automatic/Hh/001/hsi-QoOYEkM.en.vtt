00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
kind of wheels on your bike what is it

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.940 
kind of wheels on your bike what is it
going<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.409> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> make<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.800> turn

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
going to do it's going to make it turn

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.710 
going to do it's going to make it turn
quicker<00:01:15.280> it's<00:01:15.640> going<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.850> accelerate<00:01:16.270> quicker

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
quicker it's going to accelerate quicker

quicker it's going to accelerate quicker
I<00:01:17.020> know<00:01:17.890> one<00:01:18.130> thing's<00:01:18.340> for<00:01:18.429> sure<00:01:18.549> it<00:01:18.940> sure

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
I know one thing's for sure it sure

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.130 
I know one thing's for sure it sure
makes<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.539> look<00:01:19.750> cooler

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
makes it look cooler

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.680 
makes it look cooler
BST<00:01:20.770> carbon<00:01:21.280> fiber<00:01:21.460> wheels<00:01:21.640> are<00:01:22.270> they<00:01:22.509> work

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
BST carbon fiber wheels are they work

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:34.300 
BST carbon fiber wheels are they work
for<00:01:22.810> money<00:01:22.929> let's<00:01:23.770> go<00:01:23.890> find<00:01:24.130> out

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.890 

coming<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.150> test<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.570> was<00:01:35.690> really

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
coming to this test I was really

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.050 
coming to this test I was really
skeptical<00:01:36.260> at<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.650> BST<00:01:37.010> carbon<00:01:37.549> fiber<00:01:37.729> wheels

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
skeptical at the BST carbon fiber wheels

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.750 
skeptical at the BST carbon fiber wheels
I<00:01:38.360> mean<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.930> know<00:01:38.990> they<00:01:39.170> look<00:01:39.320> cool<00:01:39.530> but

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
I mean I know they look cool but

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.700 
I mean I know they look cool but
anything<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:40.790> cost<00:01:41.170> $3500<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.320> mean<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:42.680> it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
anything that cost $3500 I mean can it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.370 
anything that cost $3500 I mean can it
really<00:01:43.159> help<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.580> much<00:01:43.970> can<00:01:44.509> lender<00:01:45.200> wheels

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
really help that much can lender wheels

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.749 
really help that much can lender wheels
make<00:01:45.650> your<00:01:45.770> bike<00:01:45.920> handle<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.369> much<00:01:46.549> better

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
make your bike handle that much better

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.780 
make your bike handle that much better
well<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.810> short<00:01:47.990> answer<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.380> yes<00:01:48.860> as<00:01:49.549> soon<00:01:49.640> as

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
well the short answer is yes as soon as

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.520 
well the short answer is yes as soon as
we<00:01:49.880> get<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.060> track<00:01:50.270> with<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.600> BST<00:01:51.080> carbon

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
we get the track with the BST carbon

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620 
we get the track with the BST carbon

a lap dip it in the turn and the bike it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.510 
a lap dip it in the turn and the bike it
fell<00:01:56.570> into<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.960> corner<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.530> quickly<00:01:58.070> that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
fell into the corner so quickly that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.219 
fell into the corner so quickly that
thought<00:01:58.850> like<00:01:59.030> maybe<00:01:59.330> something's<00:01:59.869> wrong

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
thought like maybe something's wrong

thought like maybe something's wrong
axle<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:02.570> after<00:02:03.530> like<00:02:03.680> realize<00:02:04.070> you

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
axle and then after like realize you

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.160 
axle and then after like realize you
know<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.670> wasn't<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.780> happened<00:02:06.140> to

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
know that wasn't it and it happened to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.779 
know that wasn't it and it happened to
get<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.590> next<00:02:06.800> corner<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.310> again<00:02:07.550> in<00:02:07.729> the

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
get on the next corner and again in the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.910 
get on the next corner and again in the
next<00:02:07.880> corner<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.869> my<00:02:09.019> god<00:02:09.050> these<00:02:09.619> wheels

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
next corner I'm like my god these wheels

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160 
next corner I'm like my god these wheels
are<00:02:10.130> they're<00:02:10.519> insane<00:02:11.150> trail<00:02:11.600> braking<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.080> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
are they're insane trail braking in the
