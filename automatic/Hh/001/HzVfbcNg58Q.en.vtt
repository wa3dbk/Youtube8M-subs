00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.220
 is that what I'm going to do is like 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.470
 always quickie so this is not 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.300
 very internal we are going to start the first 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.370
 is going to be my base in the base that most 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.220
 you liked you are in this past month and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 that I use a lot is the one that I study 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.640
 smash box skin is what I wear now 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.059
 and leaves a super nice finish going 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.800
 phenomenal for photographs is 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.929
 moisturizer will work super well for 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.809
 dry skin and says it lasts 15 hours 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.429
 I do not know that but good is great 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.570
 as a proofreader I have to talk about some 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.739
 pallets that are pallets really of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.330
 base but classes or also as 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.970
 I am using them a lot for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 my productions and I think it's a brand 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210
 impressive professional and it's the brand 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.210
 cake cosmetics 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.340
 and these are three palettes with the ones with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.469
 tonalities to raise the types of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.359
 tonalities only that differ that 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.460
 each one goes through a different sub tone 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.670
 for example this is the sub toma 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 central and beni different shades that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.759
 It has a texture like creamy it's worth but 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.079
 leaves a very good coverage and it 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.240
 extends very well is very we believe and is 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.359
 everything is serious the natural sectors 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.939
 that would be all means these would be 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.599
 the ruby sub tones that would be more 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.039
 throwing rosaditos is worth and then we have 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:53.270
 the sub tone olive that are the most 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.369
 yellows then it would be the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.119
 yellowish of the rosaditos as you see 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.530
 and these would be the neutrals worth me 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.360
 They are enjoying it a lot in little 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.679
 I will speak directly to be a roller 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.079
 of this brand because it 's a brand 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.329
 impressive professional but we continue 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.789
 forward as loose powder I will use 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.829
 I'm going to put some compact ones 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.480
 also that they are translucent 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.129
 compact so you can see that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
 there are also possibilities of having 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.360
 powders with translucent pe shaped 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.510
 compact 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.930
 As a blush I have to take out as not 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.070
 some noise because I love a lot and this 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.110
 is knowing that it bears this color of 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.690
 Mbugua exactly this color since 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.760

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.170
 more and we have changed the tone is not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.590
 rose pom pom and low 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.480
