00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
like himself a little bit of a French so

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.000 
like himself a little bit of a French so
I<00:06:29.040> tend<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:29.940> like<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.320> mix<00:06:31.320> it<00:06:31.500> up<00:06:31.590> against

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
I tend to like to mix it up against

think<00:07:04.510> yeah<00:07:05.510> I<00:07:05.780> thought<00:07:06.110> he<00:07:06.260> might<00:07:06.470> go<00:07:06.650> for

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
think yeah I thought he might go for

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.980 
think yeah I thought he might go for
this<00:07:06.890> but<00:07:07.250> I<00:07:07.280> should<00:07:07.490> still<00:07:07.520> just<00:07:07.970> bring<00:07:08.840> my

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
this but I should still just bring my

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.780 
this but I should still just bring my
rook<00:07:09.260> down<00:07:09.470> to<00:07:09.680> the<00:07:09.800> seventh<00:07:10.160> rank<00:07:10.460> and<00:07:10.700> then

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
rook down to the seventh rank and then

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.580 
rook down to the seventh rank and then
try<00:07:11.000> to<00:07:11.030> get<00:07:11.270> the<00:07:11.390> other<00:07:11.540> passed<00:07:11.810> pawn<00:07:12.080> going<00:07:12.470> I

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
try to get the other passed pawn going I

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.360 
try to get the other passed pawn going I
think<00:07:12.890> I<00:07:12.950> can<00:07:13.130> play<00:07:13.310> this<00:07:13.340> way<00:07:13.700> oh<00:07:15.100> wait<00:07:16.100> I

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
think I can play this way oh wait I

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.130 
think I can play this way oh wait I
shouldn't<00:07:16.970> have<00:07:17.030> done<00:07:17.240> that<00:07:17.270> he<00:07:17.900> could<00:07:18.080> have

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
shouldn't have done that he could have

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.780 
shouldn't have done that he could have
actually<00:07:18.350> just<00:07:18.680> traded<00:07:19.010> rooks<00:07:19.250> I<00:07:19.370> think<00:07:19.580> and

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
actually just traded rooks I think and

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.900 
actually just traded rooks I think and
then<00:07:20.690> stopped<00:07:21.170> me<00:07:21.470> from<00:07:21.890> achieving<00:07:22.070> my<00:07:22.610> evil

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
then stopped me from achieving my evil

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.480 
then stopped me from achieving my evil
plans<00:07:23.620> but<00:07:24.620> it's<00:07:24.770> hard<00:07:24.980> when<00:07:25.070> you're<00:07:25.310> under

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:51.740 
going to push this pawn just I'm just

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.890

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:57.710 
probably could have pushed that pawn for

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.910 
probably could have pushed that pawn for
