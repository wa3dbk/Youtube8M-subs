so<00:00:08.230> we've<00:00:08.320> gotten<00:00:08.590> our<00:00:08.709> ball<00:00:08.860> to<00:00:09.010> bounce<00:00:09.190> off

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
so we've gotten our ball to bounce off

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.890 
so we've gotten our ball to bounce off
the<00:00:09.580> paddles<00:00:10.000> but<00:00:10.180> it's<00:00:10.299> not<00:00:10.449> really<00:00:10.690> good

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
the paddles but it's not really good

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.840 
the paddles but it's not really good
enough<00:00:11.139> we<00:00:11.440> want<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:11.770> ball<00:00:11.949> to<00:00:12.129> bounce<00:00:12.279> off<00:00:12.610> at

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
enough we want the ball to bounce off at

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.000 
enough we want the ball to bounce off at
a<00:00:12.910> different<00:00:13.299> angle<00:00:13.480> depending<00:00:14.410> on<00:00:14.529> where<00:00:14.799> on

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
a different angle depending on where on

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.550 
a different angle depending on where on
the<00:00:15.250> paddle<00:00:15.580> it<00:00:15.699> hits<00:00:15.940> so<00:00:16.870> open<00:00:17.320> up<00:00:17.440> the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
the paddle it hits so open up the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.270 
the paddle it hits so open up the
object-ball<00:00:18.190> and<00:00:19.140> select<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.500> object<00:00:20.710> player

drag that over and to determine the
direction<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.270> bounce<00:00:40.480> we<00:00:41.410> are<00:00:41.500> going<00:00:41.680> to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
direction of the bounce we are going to

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.130 
direction of the bounce we are going to
use<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.950> little<00:00:42.130> formula<00:00:42.700> there<00:00:43.540> are<00:00:43.780> several

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
use a little formula there are several

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.500 
use a little formula there are several
formulas<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:45.070> we<00:00:45.399> could<00:00:45.579> use<00:00:45.880> but<00:00:46.149> this<00:00:46.329> one

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
formulas that we could use but this one

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.930 
formulas that we could use but this one
is<00:00:46.660> pretty<00:00:46.840> simple<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:48.370> are<00:00:48.460> going<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.700> type

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
is pretty simple so we are going to type

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
is pretty simple so we are going to type
object<00:00:50.040> underscore<00:00:51.180> player<00:00:52.180> underscore<00:00:53.079> blue

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
object underscore player underscore blue

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.750 
object underscore player underscore blue
dot<00:00:54.940> y<00:00:56.730> minus<00:00:57.730> y<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.829> what<00:00:59.980> this<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.250> doing<00:01:00.280> is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
dot y minus y so what this is doing is

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.750 
dot y minus y so what this is doing is
determining<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.570> Y<00:01:01.989> position<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.280> object

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
determining the Y position of the object

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.149 
determining the Y position of the object
player<00:01:04.030> blue<00:01:04.329> which<00:01:04.719> is<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> paddle<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.469> then

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
player blue which is the paddle and then

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.719 
player blue which is the paddle and then
subtracting<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.909> Y<00:01:07.539> of<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:08.200> ball<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.520> for

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
subtracting the Y of the ball so for

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.440 
subtracting the Y of the ball so for
example<00:01:10.240> if<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.929> object<00:01:11.649> player<00:01:12.009> blue<00:01:12.369> was<00:01:13.299> at

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
example if the object player blue was at

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.840 
example if the object player blue was at
a<00:01:13.479> Y<00:01:13.780> position<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.499> 100<00:01:15.039> and<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.310> ball<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.670> at

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
a Y position of 100 and the ball was at

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.859 
a Y position of 100 and the ball was at
50<00:01:16.270> then<00:01:16.929> it<00:01:17.319> would<00:01:17.670> calculate<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.939> return<00:01:19.600> a

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
50 then it would calculate and return a

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.819 
50 then it would calculate and return a
value<00:01:20.229> of<00:01:20.409> 50<00:01:20.829> that<00:01:21.549> 50<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.929> Direction<00:01:23.560> box

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
value of 50 that 50 in the Direction box

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.929 
value of 50 that 50 in the Direction box
would<00:01:24.159> then<00:01:24.490> correlate<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.420> 50<00:01:25.959> degree<00:01:26.229> bounce

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
would then correlate to 50 degree bounce

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.519 
would then correlate to 50 degree bounce
likewise<00:01:27.939> if<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.209> paddle<00:01:28.630> was<00:01:28.779> at<00:01:28.899> 100<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:29.529 
likewise if the paddle was at 100 and

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:32.550 
likewise if the paddle was at 100 and
the<00:01:29.619> ball<00:01:29.799> was<00:01:30.039> at<00:01:30.329> 150<00:01:31.329> then<00:01:31.869> we<00:01:32.079> would<00:01:32.229> get<00:01:32.380> a

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
the ball was at 150 then we would get a

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.160 
the ball was at 150 then we would get a
negative<00:01:32.590> 50<00:01:33.459> direction<00:01:33.969> or<00:01:34.209> an<00:01:34.389> angle<00:01:34.959> of<00:01:35.109> a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
negative 50 direction or an angle of a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.160 
negative 50 direction or an angle of a
negative<00:01:35.619> 50<00:01:35.979> when<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> value<00:01:37.899> or

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
negative 50 when you have a value or

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.099 
negative 50 when you have a value or
parameter<00:01:38.979> where<00:01:39.579> we<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:40.090> an<00:01:40.359> object<00:01:40.599> name

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
parameter where we have an object name

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.639 
parameter where we have an object name
and<00:01:41.409> then<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.740> dot<00:01:42.039> something<00:01:42.639> that<00:01:43.569> dot<00:01:43.899> can

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
and then a dot something that dot can

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.099 
and then a dot something that dot can
basically<00:01:44.859> be<00:01:45.249> thought<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.909> an<00:01:46.240> apostrophe

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
basically be thought of as an apostrophe

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.719 
basically be thought of as an apostrophe

will basically mean that the speed is

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.140 
will basically mean that the speed is
equal<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
equal to

its<00:02:14.330> current<00:02:14.840> speed<00:02:15.170> which<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.190> last

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
its current speed which in the last

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.330 
its current speed which in the last
video<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:17.090> set<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.540> 12<00:02:17.920> however<00:02:18.920> we're<00:02:19.160> also

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
video we set to be 12 however we're also

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.130 
video we set to be 12 however we're also
going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> add<00:02:20.860> point<00:02:21.860> three<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.300> now<00:02:23.540> when<00:02:24.019> it

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
going to add point three so now when it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.809 
going to add point three so now when it
hits<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.410> paddle<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.040> ball<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.400> speed<00:02:25.670> up

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
hits a paddle the ball will speed up

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.540 
hits a paddle the ball will speed up
slightly<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.629> that<00:02:26.660> as<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.410> game<00:02:27.590> goes<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
slightly so that as the game goes on the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.490 
slightly so that as the game goes on the
ball<00:02:28.700> moves<00:02:28.940> faster<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.959> ball<00:02:30.140> becomes

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
ball moves faster and the ball becomes

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.330 
ball moves faster and the ball becomes
harder<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.920> keep<00:02:31.160> up<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.360> hit<00:02:32.810> OK<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.349> now

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
harder to keep up with so hit OK and now

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.780 
harder to keep up with so hit OK and now
we<00:02:34.370> need<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.730> set<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.720> orange<00:02:35.989> player<00:02:36.790> we

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
we need to set up the orange player we

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.789 
we need to set up the orange player we
can<00:02:37.940> delete<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.450> bounce<00:02:38.870> action<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.530> we<00:02:39.590> put

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
can delete the bounce action that we put

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.699 
can delete the bounce action that we put
in<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:39.980> last<00:02:40.220> time<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.700> drag<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.840> move

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
in there last time and drag in the move

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.539 
in there last time and drag in the move
free<00:02:43.160> action<00:02:43.670> again<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:45.290> formula<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> bit

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
free action again this formula is a bit

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.280 
free action again this formula is a bit
more<00:02:46.730> complex<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.569> I'm<00:02:47.630> not<00:02:47.810> really<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
more complex and I'm not really going to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.930 
more complex and I'm not really going to
spend<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> time<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.769> explain<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.849> is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
spend the time to explain it so this is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.339

will<00:02:51.650> say<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:51.890> copy<00:02:52.549> so<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:53.900> need<00:02:54.049> an<00:02:54.230> opening

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
will say just copy so we need an opening

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
and test the formula see what it

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.009 
and test the formula see what it
actually<00:03:18.350> does<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.519> will<00:03:19.760> give<00:03:20.000> us<00:03:20.030> the

actually does but this will give us the

actually does but this will give us the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
same angle of bounce that we are getting

same angle of bounce that we are getting
from<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.290> blue<00:03:24.650> player<00:03:25.040> object<00:03:25.549> we<00:03:26.450> also<00:03:26.630> want

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
from the blue player object we also want

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.210 
from the blue player object we also want
to<00:03:26.959> set<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.319> speed<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:28.040> current<00:03:28.760> speed<00:03:29.079> plus

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
to set the speed to current speed plus

0.3 click OK
finally<00:03:34.280> we<00:03:34.519> want<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.790> make<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.209> object<00:03:35.389> ball

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
finally we want to make the object ball

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.620 
finally we want to make the object ball
a<00:03:36.230> solid<00:03:36.799> object<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:37.519> click<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.880> solid<00:03:38.420> check

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
a solid object so click the solid check

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.839 
a solid object so click the solid check
box<00:03:39.130> however<00:03:40.130> we<00:03:40.340> don't<00:03:40.400> want<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.639> make<00:03:40.760> the

box however we don't want to make the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.879 
box however we don't want to make the
paddle<00:03:41.060> solid<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:42.049> found<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.560> during

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
paddle solid because I found that during

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.740 
paddle solid because I found that during
testing<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.730> actually<00:03:44.120> causes<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.569> little

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
testing that actually causes a little

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.319 
testing that actually causes a little
bit<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.260> problem<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.010> creates<00:03:46.579> bugs<00:03:46.970> when

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
bit of a problem and creates bugs when

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.640 
bit of a problem and creates bugs when
we<00:03:47.540> program<00:03:48.109> in<00:03:48.260> AI<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.910> click<00:03:50.569> OK<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.079> let's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
we program in AI so click OK and let's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.740 
we program in AI so click OK and let's
test<00:03:51.919> this<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.889> what<00:03:55.669> we<00:03:55.790> should<00:03:56.000> see<00:03:56.269> here<00:03:56.569> is

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
test this and what we should see here is

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.270 
test this and what we should see here is
that<00:03:56.989> if<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:57.410> hit<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.010> ball<00:04:00.069> close<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.099> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
that if we hit the ball close to the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.420 
that if we hit the ball close to the
middle<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.989> will<00:04:03.019> get<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.319> shallow<00:04:03.709> angle<00:04:04.069> of

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
middle we will get a shallow angle of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.069 
middle we will get a shallow angle of
bounce<00:04:04.669> but<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:05.209> hit<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.450> on<00:04:05.569> an<00:04:05.780> edge

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
bounce but if we hit it on an edge

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.129 
bounce but if we hit it on an edge
whoops<00:04:06.760> missed<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.970> we<00:04:08.840> should<00:04:08.989> get<00:04:09.079> a

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
whoops missed it we should get a

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.460 
whoops missed it we should get a
shallower<00:04:09.680> angle

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.580 

which<00:04:16.470> doesn't<00:04:16.890> really<00:04:17.040> seem<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.970> case

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
which doesn't really seem to be the case

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.000 
which doesn't really seem to be the case
there<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:19.709> go

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
there we go

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.970 
there we go
that<00:04:20.130> seemed<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.489> little<00:04:20.609> bit<00:04:21.380> yeah<00:04:22.380> we<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.830> can

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
that seemed a little bit yeah we you can

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.560 
that seemed a little bit yeah we you can
see<00:04:23.160> as<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.490> hit<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.030> middle<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
see as you hit it in the middle of the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.510 
see as you hit it in the middle of the
paddle<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.340> very<00:04:26.340> flat<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:28.310> when<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.400> hit

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
paddle it is very flat but when you hit

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.510 
paddle it is very flat but when you hit
it<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.760> corner<00:04:30.180> there<00:04:30.860> it's<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.950> very<00:04:31.980> steep

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
it on a corner there it's a very steep

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.220 
it on a corner there it's a very steep
and<00:04:32.820> sharp<00:04:33.180> angle<00:04:35.720> okay<00:04:36.720> well<00:04:36.900> that's<00:04:37.110> enough

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
and sharp angle okay well that's enough

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.370 
and sharp angle okay well that's enough
of<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.510> our<00:04:39.630> game<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.960> definitely

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
of that so our game is definitely

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.200 
of that so our game is definitely
playable<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:41.130> right<00:04:41.310> now<00:04:41.460> it'll<00:04:41.669> just<00:04:41.790> go<00:04:42.090> on

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
playable but right now it'll just go on

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.480 
playable but right now it'll just go on
forever<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> next<00:04:43.650> video<00:04:43.890> we'll<00:04:44.310> set

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
forever so in the next video we'll set

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
forever so in the next video we'll set
up<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.669> scoring<00:04:45.060> system<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.570> make<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.050> that

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
up a scoring system and make it so that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.610 
up a scoring system and make it so that
one<00:04:46.380> player<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.980> other<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.400> win
