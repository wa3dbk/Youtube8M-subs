00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.799
 welcome people from youtube this 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.520
 tutorial is dedicated to musicians like 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.770
 you or me that we have little recourse and 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.540
 we do not have a decent amplifier for 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.860
 can touch a lot of people wonder if 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.920
 you can connect the guitar to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.590
 computer and I say yes, yes 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.750
 it moves but first of all we have 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.840
 than having the simple materials by 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.840
 example 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.510
 the instruments and second one thing 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.510
 they have to get a line 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.300
 and the second 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.450
 get an expensive device like 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.080
 nothing more lies have to get 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.080
 a plus of these thing that I 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 Oh 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.190
 and this is not this 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.720
 to connect the guitar and it 's at 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.600
 microphone 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 when entering the microphone of the PC 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 notebook or the frame if you are smaller 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 so this is part of what I'm going 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.580
 to teach this is the physical part of what 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.710
 what I am teaching them, for example 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 connect the guitar and connect is all 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.810
 the microphone input to the computer 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 now I'm going to show you by computer 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.600
 what do they have to download for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.820
 to be able to touch and be happy, good 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.909
 requirements are not so there are not so many 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.770
 they are roughly two gigas of ram for 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.210
 those that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 but those who have a computer more 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.260
 new 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.909
 because if not what will happen the sound will 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.940
 would delay and they will have a small 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.170
 mishap already if I'm going to show you the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.170
 another edition now 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.710
 and now I could show it as good 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.130
 more than anything show the programs that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 they have to use to be able to connect 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 avoid breaking up and be happy clear that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 it's just one thing that comes with crack and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.720
 All inclusive, I'll leave the link 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 the download to the description and I 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 download and thanks to what I say 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.319
 to me as something from argentina uar is that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.220
 they left the link with the crack so what 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.739
 you can leave the link of argentino hours and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.400
 this program is not going to need it 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.690
 use it because it is included in the track 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 then we download the program I already 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.849
 I would leave it 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.519
 we extract the guitar folder 4 that 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.819
 it weighs about 250 megabytes 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.040
 it does not weigh more 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.739
 so 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.849
 what are we going to do now after 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.359
 we bring the folder we install the 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.459
 advisor or whatever you want to tell him and we are going to 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.329
 the crack part and we start with 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.329
 guitars 4 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.920
 enter a guitar and they can start 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.330
 to choose 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.180
 the amplifiers that want 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.860
 I always use be for my mike guitar 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.450
 but 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 and use 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.410
 let's take this out we like this one 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.410
 amplifier is ugly 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.560
 depending on the distortions here 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.280
 have the pedals and in the modes 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.579
 mobilizations the controllers of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.620
 pedal volume the compressors those of 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.680
 laws the tools they need for 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:54.079
 example split the crossovers and the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.110
 sound levels already then as already 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.220
 I say 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.330
 bring the folder has no key 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.260
 they use the crack part 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.260
 in 32 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.650
 and that would be more than anything what is the 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.850
 small tutorial of what is more or 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.410
 least so they can connect their 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.049
 guitars to the computer and poke bulla 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.220
 successive in stopping there are other programs 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.010
 but I prefer to use the guitar rig 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.270
 complete last and bring more pedal and 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.680
 since he is not a father and does not have what 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:36.110
 suddenly play a soccer program 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.800
 that would be like to see little fingers up 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.740
 for the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.930
 to be able to keep hearing this 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.930
 type and I hope you like it 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.110
 let me know if it works for them if not their 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.240
 raising my channel I upload videos all 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.569
 practically every Thursday 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.569
 so 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.070
 and greetings to all who see us like this 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.280
 that would be we'll see each other until the next 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.280
 8
