00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sprite or something it is probably what

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
sprite or something it is probably what
your<00:00:57.690> best<00:00:57.870> option<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.500> yeah<00:00:58.859> cuz<00:00:59.129> it's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
your best option would be yeah cuz it's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
your best option would be yeah cuz it's
its<00:00:59.550> most<00:00:59.910> typically<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> drink<00:01:00.629> they'll<00:01:01.350> make

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
its most typically to drink they'll make

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
its most typically to drink they'll make
like<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> pina<00:01:02.430> colada<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.480> a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.000 
mean I think it's you know it's real
easy<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:48.379> problem<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.620> mentally

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
easy to it's the problem I have mentally

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
easy to it's the problem I have mentally
with<00:02:50.129> stuff<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.940> when<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> look<00:02:51.629> at

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
with stuff like this is when I look at

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.680 
with stuff like this is when I look at
such<00:02:51.930> low<00:02:52.200> alcohol<00:02:52.769> percentage<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.690> start

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
such low alcohol percentage I start

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.660 
such low alcohol percentage I start
thinking<00:02:54.900> okay<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.319> now<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.889> becomes<00:02:56.190> easier

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
thinking okay it now it becomes easier

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
thinking okay it now it becomes easier
to<00:02:56.760> give<00:02:57.030> yourself<00:02:57.359> more<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> flavor<00:02:58.109> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
to give yourself more of the flavor of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.860 
to give yourself more of the flavor of
what<00:02:58.769> you're<00:02:59.370> trying<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.639> be<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.629> flavor

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
what you're trying to be the the flavor

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
what you're trying to be the the flavor
is<00:03:01.049> trying<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.379> be<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> less<00:03:02.159> of<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> alcohol

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
is trying to be and less of the alcohol

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.180 
is trying to be and less of the alcohol
the<00:03:02.879> flavor<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.659> other<00:03:03.840> thing<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.920> vast

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the flavor the other thing is the vast

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.720 
the flavor the other thing is the vast
majority<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.760> cheap<00:03:06.319> distilleries<00:03:07.319> or<00:03:08.159> less
