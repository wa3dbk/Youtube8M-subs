gives me more skin real estate and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.310 
gives me more skin real estate and
that's<00:00:29.880> particularly<00:00:30.210> useful<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.840> apps<00:00:31.170> like

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
that's particularly useful for apps like

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.030 
that's particularly useful for apps like
chrome<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.399> right<00:00:32.790> over<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.270> i<00:00:33.480> turn<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.320> look

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
chrome so right over here i turn on look

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
chrome so right over here i turn on look
how<00:00:35.219> more<00:00:35.940> space<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.960> top

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
how more space are you got it on the top

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920 
how more space are you got it on the top
and<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> bottom<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:39.719> nice

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and the bottom and this is pretty nice

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.799 
and the bottom and this is pretty nice
but<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.710> problem<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.790> turns<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.600> for

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
but the problem is that it turns on for

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
but the problem is that it turns on for
every<00:00:43.170> single<00:00:43.950> thing<00:00:43.980> i<00:00:44.280> use<00:00:44.489> every<00:00:45.239> single

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
notification now you can do that by just

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
notification now you can do that by just
going<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.949> turn<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> off<00:00:56.370> woof<00:00:56.699> by

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
going over here and turn it off woof by

going over here and turn it off again

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
going over here and turn it off again
but<00:00:59.059> the<00:01:00.059> problem<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
but the problem is that have to do this

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
but the problem is that have to do this
every<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.160> gets<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.609> annoying

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
every time and that gets a bit annoying

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.109 
every time and that gets a bit annoying
so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:04.010> talked<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.250> feature<00:01:05.519> close<00:01:05.939> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so I talked about a feature close on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.410 
so I talked about a feature close on
that<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:06.510> oh<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.549> that<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> maybe<00:01:08.939> turning

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that video oh and that is maybe turning

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
that video oh and that is maybe turning
more<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.439> specific<00:01:10.950> apps<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
more and more down on specific apps I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.480 
more and more down on specific apps I
use<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.790> turn<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.270> otherwise<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.490> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
use and turn them off otherwise but you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
use and turn them off otherwise but you
can<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.659> can't<00:01:16.530> automate<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.100> by

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
can do this you can't automate it by

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600 
can do this you can't automate it by
using<00:01:17.729> tasker<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> secure<00:01:19.650> settings<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.430> on

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
using tasker and secure settings so on

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.859 
using tasker and secure settings so on
this<00:01:20.729> video<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> show<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> how<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this video I'm going to show you how to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.340 
this video I'm going to show you how to
automate<00:01:22.770> immersion<00:01:23.640> mod<00:01:23.820> using<00:01:24.720> tasker<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
automate immersion mod using tasker and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.340 
automate immersion mod using tasker and
secure<00:01:25.770> settings<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.430> let's<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> started

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
secure settings so let's get it started

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
secure settings so let's get it started
so<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> download<00:01:29.340> tasker<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so first we have to download tasker and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.770 
so first we have to download tasker and
secure<00:01:30.659> settings<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> play<00:01:31.799> store<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> i

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
secure settings and the play store so i

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
secure settings and the play store so i
don't<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.500> much<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> task<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.250> cost

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
don't know how much the task of cost

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't know how much the task of cost
because<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.479> don't<00:01:36.659> remember<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.280> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

to<00:04:07.709> try<00:04:07.950> chrome<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:10.049> watch<00:04:10.889> it<00:04:11.040> disappear<00:04:11.130> so

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
to try chrome and watch it disappear so

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.340 
to try chrome and watch it disappear so
now<00:04:13.350> we're<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.799> go<00:04:13.889> home<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:15.350> turn

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
now we're going to go home and turn

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.349 
now we're going to go home and turn
back<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> runway<00:04:16.829> which<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.250> did<00:04:17.430> now

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
back to the runway which it did now

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.500 
back to the runway which it did now
let's<00:04:18.570> try<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> tap<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> talk<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> what's<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
let's try to tap a talk so what's the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.830 
let's try to tap a talk so what's the
Turing<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.900> full<00:04:22.109> screen<00:04:22.409> and<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.419> exhale

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
Turing the full screen and when I exhale

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.379 
Turing the full screen and when I exhale
I

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
I

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.390 
I
again<00:04:25.629> and<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.319> turned<00:04:26.680> back<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.919> normal<00:04:27.249> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
again and this turned back to normal and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.089 
again and this turned back to normal and
it<00:04:27.639> did<00:04:27.819> so<00:04:28.689> that's<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:29.319> so<00:04:29.560> that's<00:04:29.590> watching

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099
