about your aim being off your target

about your aim being off your target
when<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.640> close<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.539> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
when you're you know close up or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.310 
when you're you know close up or
slightly<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:02.160> further<00:01:03.090> away<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.229> know

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
slightly a further away at you know

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
slightly a further away at you know
close<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> medium<00:01:05.220> range<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.390> nice<00:01:06.600> as

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
close to medium range which is nice as

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.179 
close to medium range which is nice as
you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.830> bring

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you can see right there I can bring

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
you can see right there I can bring
people<00:01:08.400> down<00:01:08.670> relatively<00:01:09.180> easy<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
people down relatively easy but the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.179 
people down relatively easy but the
downside<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:12.500> picking<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.680> off<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
downside to picking people off at a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.670 
downside to picking people off at a
distance<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.790> iron<00:01:15.060> sight<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.750> does<00:01:16.380> take

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
distance is the iron sight it does take

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
distance is the iron sight it does take
quite<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.490> used<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.909> unlike<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
quite a bit to get used to unlike the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
quite a bit to get used to unlike the
Magnum<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.229> has<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.860> distinct<00:01:20.490> front

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Magnum which has a pretty distinct front

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
Magnum which has a pretty distinct front
crosshair<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> blends<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
crosshair this one kind of blends in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.190 
crosshair this one kind of blends in
with<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.860> crosshair<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> does

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
with the back crosshair so it does

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
with the back crosshair so it does
flatten<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:29.189> makes<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> really

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
flatten it out which makes it really

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960 
flatten it out which makes it really
hard<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.049> tell<00:01:31.409> where<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> center<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
hard to tell where the center is on the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.270 
hard to tell where the center is on the
go<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.110> trying<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> get

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
go you know when you're trying to get

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.890 
go you know when you're trying to get
those<00:01:35.520> quick<00:01:36.450> reaction<00:01:37.020> shots<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
those quick reaction shots but and the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
those quick reaction shots but and the
stopping<00:01:40.290> power<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.119> get

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
stopping power of it is nice if you get

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
stopping power of it is nice if you get
headshots<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.380> did<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.770> there

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
headshots just like I did right there

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
headshots just like I did right there
but<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.000> feel<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.420> 50<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.409> 50<00:01:47.299> damage<00:01:48.299> per

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
but I feel like 50 a 50 damage per

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
but I feel like 50 a 50 damage per
bullet<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.380> cutting<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.430> bit<00:01:50.850> too

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
bullet is cutting it a little bit too

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.929 
bullet is cutting it a little bit too
close<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.840> far<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.560> bringing<00:01:53.430> people<00:01:53.909> down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
close as far as bringing people down

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
close as far as bringing people down
because<00:01:54.329> that's<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.530> one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
because that's you have to get one

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
because that's you have to get one
hundred<00:01:56.369> percent<00:01:56.399> damage<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.240> them<00:01:57.590> exactly

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
hundred percent damage on them exactly

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
hundred percent damage on them exactly
in<00:01:58.890> order<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.219> bring<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.719> they

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
in order to bring them down so if they

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.499 
in order to bring them down so if they
have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> medic<00:02:01.439> pack<00:02:01.649> next<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:03.210> might

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
have a medic pack next to them you might

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
have a medic pack next to them you might
have<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.259> shoot<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.009> time<00:02:05.189> because

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
have to shoot them one more time because

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.789 
have to shoot them one more time because
they'll<00:02:06.270> regain<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.229> enough<00:02:07.530> health

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
they'll regain and just enough health

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.880 
they'll regain and just enough health
just<00:02:08.759> enough<00:02:09.090> health<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> make<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
just enough health to make it so that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
just enough health to make it so that
you<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> pump<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:12.030> more<00:02:12.239> shot<00:02:12.510> into<00:02:12.780> them

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
you have to pump one more shot into them

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.880 
you have to pump one more shot into them
and<00:02:13.209> that's<00:02:13.720> really<00:02:13.870> not<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.319> best<00:02:14.440> scenario

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and that's really not the best scenario

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.490 
and that's really not the best scenario
what<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.550> want<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> put<00:02:15.940> yourself<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.599> when

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
what you want to put yourself in when

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.080 
what you want to put yourself in when
you're<00:02:17.620> using<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.069> pistol<00:02:18.310> when<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:18.819> using

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
you're using a pistol when you're using

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.960 
you're using a pistol when you're using
a<00:02:19.239> pistol<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.769> you're<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.160> against<00:02:21.580> people

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
a pistol and you're going against people

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.729 
a pistol and you're going against people
that<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.420> assault<00:02:22.750> rifles<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.319> light

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
that have like assault rifles and light

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.449 
that have like assault rifles and light
machine<00:02:24.099> guns<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.450> here's<00:02:26.110> how<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.379> played<00:02:26.890> this

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
machine guns so here's how I played this

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.970 
machine guns so here's how I played this
round<00:02:27.879> by<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.390> way<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.930> round<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.410> operation

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
round by the way this round of operation

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.600 
round by the way this round of operation
metro<00:02:30.340> rush<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.660> basically<00:02:32.319> tried<00:02:32.950> my<00:02:33.190> best<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
metro rush I basically tried my best to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.830 
metro rush I basically tried my best to
be<00:02:33.870> defensive<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.110> only<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.489> know

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
be defensive and only a you know

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.050 
be defensive and only a you know
progress<00:02:37.840> forward<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.650> try<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> take

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
progress forward and try to take

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.940 
progress forward and try to take
objectives<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.930> by<00:02:41.019> take<00:02:41.230> objectives<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.799> mean

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
objectives and by take objectives I mean

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.990 
objectives and by take objectives I mean
like<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.549> directly<00:02:42.970> rmm<00:02:43.480> comes<00:02:44.160> if<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
like the directly rmm comes if the if I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.979 
like the directly rmm comes if the if I
was<00:02:46.180> completely<00:02:46.510> clear<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.540> with<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.840> in

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
was completely clear so so with that in

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.370 
was completely clear so so with that in
mind<00:02:50.019> when<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.010> wasn't<00:02:51.480> taking<00:02:52.480> objectives<00:02:53.170> I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
mind when I wasn't taking objectives I

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.740 
mind when I wasn't taking objectives I
was<00:02:54.010> placing<00:02:54.489> myself<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.940> positions<00:02:55.450> where<00:02:55.569> I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
was placing myself in positions where I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.979 
was placing myself in positions where I
could<00:02:56.079> pick<00:02:56.410> people<00:02:56.799> off<00:02:57.209> at<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.269> good<00:02:58.660> range

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
could pick people off at a good range

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.380 
could pick people off at a good range
that<00:02:59.410> wasn't<00:02:59.890> too<00:03:00.129> far<00:03:00.489> where<00:03:00.849> my<00:03:01.030> bullets

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
that wasn't too far where my bullets

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.210 
that wasn't too far where my bullets
weren't<00:03:01.660> doing<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> much<00:03:02.470> damage<00:03:02.769> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
weren't doing that much damage and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.180 
weren't doing that much damage and
that's<00:03:04.180> basically<00:03:04.599> what<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:05.110> did<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.739> like

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
that's basically what I did like like

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.460 
that's basically what I did like like
you<00:03:06.310> see<00:03:06.489> right<00:03:06.519> here<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.120> place<00:03:07.599> myself<00:03:07.780> dead

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
you see right here I place myself dead

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
you see right here I place myself dead
in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> center<00:03:08.920> because<00:03:09.549> we<00:03:09.760> had<00:03:09.970> taken<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
in the center because we had taken a and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.780 
in the center because we had taken a and
I<00:03:11.230> knew<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.739> were<00:03:11.860> gonna<00:03:11.920> have<00:03:12.129> to<00:03:12.250> defend<00:03:12.519> be

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
I knew we were gonna have to defend be

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.940 
I knew we were gonna have to defend be
and<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.780> best<00:03:13.989> place<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.440> defend<00:03:14.590> me

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and this is the best place to defend me

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.589 
and this is the best place to defend me
from<00:03:15.190> because<00:03:15.430> they<00:03:15.579> come<00:03:15.849> they<00:03:16.329> come<00:03:16.360> out

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
from because they come they come out

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.379 
from because they come they come out
like<00:03:16.780> crazy<00:03:17.170> from<00:03:17.590> their<00:03:17.859> spawn<00:03:18.310> area<00:03:18.519> towards

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
like crazy from their spawn area towards

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.960 
like crazy from their spawn area towards
the<00:03:19.600> front<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.590> station<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:21.940> a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
the front of the station and you have a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.849 
the front of the station and you have a
clear<00:03:22.299> line<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.569> sight<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:23.260> they<00:03:23.560> rush<00:03:23.829> to

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
clear line of sight as they rush to

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.000 
clear line of sight as they rush to
disarm<00:03:24.489> be<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.359> as<00:03:25.989> my<00:03:26.230> team<00:03:26.500> started<00:03:26.859> pushing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
disarm be and as my team started pushing

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.400 
disarm be and as my team started pushing
forward<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.609> ran<00:03:27.880> out<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.060> ammo<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:28.959> figured

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
forward I ran out of ammo so I figured

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.710 
forward I ran out of ammo so I figured
this<00:03:29.440> will<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.280> best<00:03:30.549> place<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.120> find<00:03:31.150> some

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
this will be the best place to find some

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.870 
this will be the best place to find some
ammo<00:03:32.079> that's<00:03:32.590> exactly<00:03:32.769> what<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:33.190> did<00:03:33.250> oh<00:03:33.400> look

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
ammo that's exactly what I did oh look

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.589 
ammo that's exactly what I did oh look
look<00:03:34.090> what<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.500> he<00:03:35.500> comes<00:03:35.829> he<00:03:36.400> dies<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:37.060> take<00:03:37.480> his

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
look what is he comes he dies I take his

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.170 
look what is he comes he dies I take his
ammo<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.109> switch<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:39.099> get<00:03:39.519> my<00:03:39.670> gun<00:03:40.150> back

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
ammo I switch I get my gun back

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.710 
ammo I switch I get my gun back
thankfully<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.139> got<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:41.709> gun<00:03:41.919> back<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.400> away

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
thankfully I got my gun back right away

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.330 
thankfully I got my gun back right away
so<00:03:43.720> that's<00:03:43.900> basically<00:03:44.079> what<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> tried<00:03:44.859> how<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
so that's basically what I tried how I

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.490 
so that's basically what I tried how I
tried<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.849> play<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.359> played<00:03:47.049> really

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
tried to play I played really

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.559 
tried to play I played really
defensively<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.099> put<00:03:48.549> myself<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:49.060> positions

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
defensively I put myself in positions

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.409 
defensively I put myself in positions
where<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.109> knew<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.980> enemy<00:03:51.459> would<00:03:51.790> be<00:03:51.970> coming

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
where I knew the enemy would be coming

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.099 
where I knew the enemy would be coming
at<00:03:52.569> me<00:03:53.019> from<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.650> good<00:03:54.599> effective<00:03:55.599> distance

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
at me from a good effective distance

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.890 
at me from a good effective distance
which<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:57.819> weapon<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.269> around<00:03:58.510> 20

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
which is with this weapon is around 20

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.470 
which is with this weapon is around 20
meters<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.560> any<00:04:00.190> further<00:04:00.459> than<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.239> are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
meters so any further than that you are

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.060 
didn't die I even stopped shooting for a
second<00:04:39.370> as<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.610> saw<00:04:39.880> uh<00:04:40.260> but<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.530> know<00:04:41.620> things

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
second as you saw uh but you know things

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.740 
second as you saw uh but you know things
like<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.910> stopping<00:04:43.300> power<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.660> it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
like that that the stopping power of it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.950 
like that that the stopping power of it
is<00:04:43.930> not<00:04:44.440> as<00:04:44.650> reliable<00:04:45.070> as<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.600> Magnum<00:04:46.600> so

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
is not as reliable as the Magnum so

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.290 
is not as reliable as the Magnum so
basically<00:04:47.320> don't<00:04:47.590> try<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:47.950> rush<00:04:48.370> when<00:04:49.180> you're
