the program you don't necessarily have
to<00:00:30.230> have<00:00:30.529> any<00:00:30.710> experience<00:00:30.830> with<00:00:31.460> design<00:00:31.910> or

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
to have any experience with design or

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.570 
to have any experience with design or
woodworking<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:33.380> start<00:00:33.680> small<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.040> then<00:00:34.370> get

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
woodworking we start small and then get

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.060 
woodworking we start small and then get
into<00:00:34.730> larger<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.330> we<00:00:36.140> start<00:00:36.500> less

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
into larger and we start less

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.530 
into larger and we start less
complicated<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.000> get<00:00:38.120> into<00:00:38.390> more

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
complicated and get into more

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.910 
complicated and get into more
complicated

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.650 

so<00:00:47.920> during<00:00:48.219> during<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.670> designing<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.420> a

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
so during during the designing of a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.349 
so during during the designing of a
project<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:51.129> we<00:00:51.280> first<00:00:51.579> get<00:00:51.789> into<00:00:52.089> is

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
project what we first get into is

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.500 
project what we first get into is
sketching<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.370> students<00:00:54.760> will<00:00:55.449> learn

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
sketching and the students will learn

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.389 
sketching and the students will learn
how<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.839> sketch<00:00:56.170> by<00:00:56.379> hand<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:56.859> we'll<00:00:57.100> go<00:00:57.219> from

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
how to sketch by hand and we'll go from

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.020 
how to sketch by hand and we'll go from
that<00:00:57.670> into<00:00:58.239> being<00:00:58.269> able<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:59.050> draw<00:00:59.829> by<00:01:00.070> hand<00:01:00.100> so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
that into being able to draw by hand so

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.209 
that into being able to draw by hand so
actually<00:01:01.479> doing<00:01:01.719> technical<00:01:02.260> shop<00:01:02.710> drawings

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
actually doing technical shop drawings

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.600 
actually doing technical shop drawings
and<00:01:03.370> then<00:01:03.879> from<00:01:04.119> there<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.539> transition<00:01:05.170> into

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and then from there we transition into

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.100 
and then from there we transition into
working<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.850> computers<00:01:07.360> all<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:08.020> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
working with computers all of the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.570 
working with computers all of the
students<00:01:08.470> here<00:01:08.590> will<00:01:08.710> learn<00:01:08.890> how<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.130> draw

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
students here will learn how to draw

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.789 
students here will learn how to draw
using<00:01:09.789> CAD<00:01:10.119> as<00:01:10.360> well<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:12.899> designed<00:01:13.899> it<00:01:13.990> around<00:01:14.140> a

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
using CAD as well I designed it around a

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.290 
using CAD as well I designed it around a
Roman<00:01:15.789> kind<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.360> style<00:01:16.630> table<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:19.060> going

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
Roman kind of style table and I'm going

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.180 
Roman kind of style table and I'm going
to<00:01:19.360> make<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.509> chair<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:20.140> looks<00:01:20.679> exactly<00:01:20.979> like

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
to make a chair that looks exactly like

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.639 
to make a chair that looks exactly like
this<00:01:21.490> end<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:21.940> well<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.360> fist<00:01:23.110> they<00:01:23.259> designed<00:01:23.560> it

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
this end as well I fist they designed it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.919 
this end as well I fist they designed it
around<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.979> chair<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.220> wanted<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.550> do<00:01:24.929> it's

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
around the chair I wanted to do it's

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:27.389 
around the chair I wanted to do it's
pretty<00:01:26.170> exciting<00:01:26.440> don't<00:01:26.860> really<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.250> any

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
pretty exciting don't really have any

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.880 
pretty exciting don't really have any
woodworking<00:01:27.850> experience<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.560> fact<00:01:29.770> that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
woodworking experience so the fact that

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.210 
woodworking experience so the fact that
I<00:01:30.340> could<00:01:30.640> make<00:01:30.819> something<00:01:31.390> like<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.810> was

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
I could make something like this was

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.499 
I could make something like this was
after<00:01:33.220> only<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.670> few<00:01:33.880> months<00:01:33.970> was<00:01:34.300> pretty

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
after only a few months was pretty

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:43.490 
after only a few months was pretty
exciting

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.899 

when<00:01:44.500> students<00:01:44.920> leave<00:01:45.130> here<00:01:45.159> they<00:01:45.549> will<00:01:45.729> have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
when students leave here they will have

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.120 
when students leave here they will have
the<00:01:46.090> ability<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.570> choose<00:01:47.350> what<00:01:47.619> environment

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
the ability to choose what environment

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.240 
the ability to choose what environment
they<00:01:48.280> working<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.799> whether<00:01:50.799> they<00:01:50.979> want<00:01:51.189> to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
they working and whether they want to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.090 
they working and whether they want to
work<00:01:51.399> for<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.729> cells<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.689> small<00:01:53.140> personal

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
work for the cells in a small personal
