want to teach you before I want to teach
you<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:35.969> notations<00:00:36.510> when<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> hold<00:00:37.380> when

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you some notations when you hold when

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.080 
you some notations when you hold when
you<00:00:37.890> hold<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> cube<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> vertical<00:00:39.300> position

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
you hold the cube in a vertical position

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
you hold the cube in a vertical position
like<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.739> side<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
like this this is the up side and this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.770 
like this this is the up side and this
is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.600> side<00:00:47.149> when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> hold<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is the down side when you hold it in a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
is the down side when you hold it in a
horizontal<00:00:48.930> position<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.100> happens<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.820> be

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
horizontal position this happens to be

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
horizontal position this happens to be
the<00:00:51.030> left<00:00:51.239> side<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> happens<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the left side and this happens to be the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.450 
the left side and this happens to be the
right<00:00:53.010> side<00:00:54.289> when<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> hold<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> wanted

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
right side when you hold if you wanted

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.599 
right side when you hold if you wanted
to<00:00:56.789> change<00:00:57.030> position<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:59.340> change

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to change position like this to change

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.779 
to change position like this to change
the<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:01.140> vertical<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> horizontal

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
the way from from vertical to horizontal

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.189 
the way from from vertical to horizontal
that<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.850> called<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.420> F<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:03.989> you're

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that is called an F because you're

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.789 
that is called an F because you're
facing<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.710> F<00:01:04.970> for<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> advanced<00:01:06.799> tutorial

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
facing it F for the advanced tutorial

you might want to know that this is the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.179 
you might want to know that this is the
back<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:11.390> but<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
ready to begin beginners method okay so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.819 
ready to begin beginners method okay so
the<00:01:40.920> beginners<00:01:41.250> method<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.960> tricky

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the beginners method is a little tricky

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.859 
the beginners method is a little tricky
but<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.880> hard<00:01:45.119> work<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.329> guys<00:01:45.659> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
but I think with hard work you guys can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:55.510 
but I think with hard work you guys can
do<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.220> first<00:01:47.220> scramble<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> cube

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.660 

okay<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.940> looks<00:01:57.120> pretty<00:01:57.660> scrambled<00:01:58.670> next

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
okay this looks pretty scrambled next

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
okay this looks pretty scrambled next
what<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.850> want<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> hold

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
what you want to do is you want to hold
the<00:02:01.650> cube<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.420> you're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:04.080> do

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the cube and you're going to have to do

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.320 
the cube and you're going to have to do
this<00:02:04.380> I'll<00:02:04.680> hold<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.820> this

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
this I'll hold it like this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:17.060 
this I'll hold it like this
um<00:02:06.900> hold<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:14.060> f2u<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.070> it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
um hold like this and you do f2u and it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.780 
um hold like this and you do f2u and it
is<00:02:17.190> solved<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.250> simple

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
is solved so it's that simple

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
is solved so it's that simple
try<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.030> again<00:02:21.300> I'll<00:02:21.480> do<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:21.840> more<00:02:21.990> time

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
try it again I'll do it one more time

try it again I'll do it one more time
with<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.740> guys<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.100> try<00:02:23.280> on

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
with you and then you guys can try on

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.820 
with you and then you guys can try on
your<00:02:23.550> own<00:02:30.410> okay<00:02:31.410> look<00:02:31.710> scrambled<00:02:32.160> enough

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
your own okay look scrambled enough

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.130 
your own okay look scrambled enough
let's<00:02:34.830> try<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> different<00:02:35.520> color<00:02:35.810> orange<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.020> up

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
let's try a different color orange is up

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.400 
let's try a different color orange is up
here<00:02:38.150> yeah<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.480> orange<00:02:43.040> f2<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:46.170> case

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
here yeah this is orange f2 this case

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.030 
here yeah this is orange f2 this case
you<00:02:46.890> invert<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.500> cube<00:02:49.770> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
you invert it and then the cube is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.990 
you invert it and then the cube is
solved<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.120> rectangle<00:02:51.720> varies<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:53.850> is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
solved or rectangle varies now there is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.480 
solved or rectangle varies now there is
a<00:02:54.030> parity<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> I'll<00:02:55.500> teach<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.040> I'll<00:02:56.130> show

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
a parity and I'll teach and I'll show

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.670 
a parity and I'll teach and I'll show
you<00:02:56.550> how<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.270> looks

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
you how it looks

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
you how it looks
parody<00:02:58.680> looks<00:02:58.950> something<00:02:59.430> like<00:03:00.150> let's<00:03:00.720> find

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
parody looks something like let's find

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.680 
parody looks something like let's find
it<00:03:03.470> yes<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.280> parity<00:03:06.080> where<00:03:08.570> they<00:03:09.570> have

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it yes this is parity where they have

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.140 
it yes this is parity where they have
opposite<00:03:10.110> colors<00:03:10.410> red<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.280> orange<00:03:11.790> they're

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
opposite colors red and orange they're

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.960 
opposite colors red and orange they're
opposite<00:03:12.630> yellow<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.709> right<00:03:14.160> or<00:03:14.430> opposite

opposite<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.959> solve<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:25.350> parity<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.280> will

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
opposite to solve this parity you will

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.670 
opposite to solve this parity you will
take<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> it'll<00:03:27.150> take<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> few<00:03:28.200> more<00:03:28.380> steps

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
take the it'll take you a few more steps

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.360 
take the it'll take you a few more steps
so<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.700> ever<00:03:30.000> happen<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.690> come<00:03:30.840> upon<00:03:31.110> it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
so if you ever happen to come upon it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.550 
so if you ever happen to come upon it
don't<00:03:32.370> fear<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.239> solvable<00:03:33.690> I'll<00:03:34.260> teach<00:03:34.440> you

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
don't fear it is solvable I'll teach you

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
don't fear it is solvable I'll teach you
the<00:03:34.590> first<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.340> how<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.489> solve<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the first way on how to solve it the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.470 
the first way on how to solve it the
first<00:03:36.420> method<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.650> cheat<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:39.150> can<00:03:39.300> always

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
first method just a cheat you can always

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.560 
first method just a cheat you can always
disassemble<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> put<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.130> back<00:03:41.160> together

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
disassemble it put it back together

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.160 
disassemble it put it back together
there<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.350> often

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
there you this often

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.470 
there you this often
well<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.290> cheating<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.709> easy<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.820> really

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
well the cheating is easy it is really

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.979 
well the cheating is easy it is really
not<00:03:48.780> as<00:03:49.500> impressive<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.370> actually<00:03:50.910> showing<00:03:51.630> it

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
not as impressive as actually showing it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.380 
not as impressive as actually showing it
off<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.290> your<00:03:52.739> friends<00:03:52.799> saying<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.790> can<00:03:54.150> solve

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
off to your friends saying I can solve

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.539 
off to your friends saying I can solve
the<00:03:54.690> two<00:03:54.840> by<00:03:55.019> one<00:03:55.230> by<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.130> I'm<00:03:56.250> gonna<00:03:56.340> teach

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
the two by one by one so I'm gonna teach

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.000 
the two by one by one so I'm gonna teach
you<00:03:56.700> how<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.850> solve<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.450> parity<00:03:57.900> which<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.860> lot

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you how to solve the parity which a lot

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.560 
you how to solve the parity which a lot
of<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.310> probably<00:03:59.519> will<00:03:59.820> hate<00:04:00.030> because<00:04:00.450> it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
of you probably will hate because it

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.420 
of you probably will hate because it
involves<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.080> little<00:04:01.170> bit<00:04:01.290> more<00:04:01.530> steps<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.280> let

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
involves a little bit more steps but let

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.199 
involves a little bit more steps but let
us<00:04:02.580> speak<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:03.630> parity<00:04:04.020> is<00:04:04.110> simple<00:04:04.790> hold<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.940> to

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
us speak the parity is simple hold it to

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.520 
us speak the parity is simple hold it to
the<00:04:06.360> whites<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:06.990> yellow

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the whites and yellow

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.949 
the whites and yellow
side<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.610> will<00:04:08.790> only<00:04:08.970> work<00:04:09.270> for<00:04:09.300> white<00:04:09.750> and

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
side it will only work for white and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.180 
side it will only work for white and
yellow<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.410> my<00:04:10.440> case<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.680> really<00:04:13.950> daring

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
yellow in my case for the really daring

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.580 
yellow in my case for the really daring
it<00:04:14.520> will<00:04:14.670> work<00:04:14.880> for<00:04:15.180> orange<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.959> red<00:04:16.139> but

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
it will work for orange and red but

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.129 
it will work for orange and red but
that's<00:04:16.980> another<00:04:17.400> algorithm<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.600> it's<00:04:18.870> very

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
that's another algorithm and it's very

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.440 
that's another algorithm and it's very
long<00:04:19.459> right<00:04:20.459> now<00:04:20.489> hold<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
long right now hold it like this the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.879 
long right now hold it like this the
yellow<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.840> top<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.410> white<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.800> the

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
yellow on top and the white on the

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.600 
yellow on top and the white on the
bottom<00:04:24.290> next<00:04:25.290> what<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.470> want<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> do<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:26.430> you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
bottom next what you want to do is you

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:38.510 
bottom next what you want to do is you
want<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.790> do<00:04:27.380> f2<00:04:30.320> u<00:04:31.610> F<00:04:33.980> or<00:04:34.980> R<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:36.680> then<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.919> do<00:04:38.220> a

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
want to do f2 u F or R and then you do a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.560 
want to do f2 u F or R and then you do a
BB<00:04:39.419> which<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.320> turning<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
BB which is turning it like this and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.230 
BB which is turning it like this and
then<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.380> want<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.590> do<00:04:43.800> an<00:04:44.130> F<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:47.820> could<00:04:48.060> also

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
then you want to do an F you could also

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.320 
then you want to do an F you could also
do<00:04:48.710> yeah<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:50.100> was<00:04:50.250> F<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.520> for<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.150> can

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
do yeah this was F in for it you can

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.420 
do yeah this was F in for it you can
also<00:04:51.480> do<00:04:51.840> F<00:04:52.230> F<00:04:52.950> F<00:04:53.610> F<00:04:54.080> until<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.230> get<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.710> but

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
also do F F F F until you get to it but

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.659 
also do F F F F until you get to it but
in<00:04:56.760> my<00:04:56.940> case<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:57.419> did<00:04:57.720> F<00:04:57.930> invert<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.680> there

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
in my case I did F invert it so there

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.000 
in my case I did F invert it so there
you<00:04:59.729> go<00:04:59.880> that's<00:05:00.570> how<00:05:00.720> solve<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.710> beginner

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
you go that's how solve it the beginner

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.159 
you go that's how solve it the beginner
method<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> want<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.630> solve<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.990> the

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
method if you want to solve it the

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.960 
method if you want to solve it the
advanced<00:05:04.470> method<00:05:04.890> I'm<00:05:05.430> gonna<00:05:05.610> teach<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.910> how

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
advanced method I'm gonna teach you how

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.060 
advanced method I'm gonna teach you how
to<00:05:06.000> solve<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:06.540> now<00:05:06.900> that's<00:05:07.590> right

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
to solve it right now that's right

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.810 
to solve it right now that's right
sub<00:05:08.880> one<00:05:09.389> second<00:05:11.570> alright<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:12.810> let's<00:05:13.110> begin

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
sub one second alright so let's begin

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.360 
sub one second alright so let's begin
now<00:05:14.820> the<00:05:15.660> advanced<00:05:16.050> method<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.620> exactly<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
now the advanced method is exactly the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.790 
now the advanced method is exactly the
same<00:05:17.580> as<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.540> inner<00:05:18.690> method<00:05:19.050> just<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.620> will

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
same as the inner method just you will

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.700 
same as the inner method just you will
solve<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.220> below<00:05:21.060> one<00:05:21.390> one<00:05:21.750> second<00:05:22.200> instead<00:05:22.650> of

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
solve it below one one second instead of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.490 
solve it below one one second instead of
a<00:05:22.979> regular<00:05:23.130> doing<00:05:23.850> all<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.390> moves<00:05:24.600> for<00:05:25.470> the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
a regular doing all the moves for the

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.369 
a regular doing all the moves for the
ones<00:05:25.710> for<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:26.250> scramble<00:05:27.240> your<00:05:27.360> cube

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.739 

all<00:05:33.379> right<00:05:33.639> you<00:05:34.639> look<00:05:34.849> at<00:05:34.999> it<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.389> you<00:05:35.449> look<00:05:35.599> at

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
all right you look at it and you look at

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:39.939 
all right you look at it and you look at
the<00:05:35.870> colors<00:05:36.939> this<00:05:37.939> is<00:05:37.999> orange<00:05:38.479> so<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.229> this<00:05:39.650> is

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
the colors this is orange so and this is

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:47.829 
the colors this is orange so and this is
orange<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.210> orange<00:05:44.749> red<00:05:45.099> orange<00:05:46.839> here's

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
orange this is orange red orange here's

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.839 
orange this is orange red orange here's
the<00:05:48.050> red<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.409> red<00:05:48.439> has<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:48.830> go<00:05:48.949> here<00:05:49.279> so<00:05:49.460> all

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
the red the red has to go here so all

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.350 
the red the red has to go here so all
you<00:05:49.969> have<00:05:50.089> to<00:05:50.210> do<00:05:50.330> now<00:05:50.509> is<00:05:50.839> just<00:05:51.770> turn<00:05:52.039> it<00:05:52.330> do<00:05:53.330> a

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
you have to do now is just turn it do a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.230 
you have to do now is just turn it do a
you<00:05:53.839> invert<00:05:54.139> it<00:05:54.400> there<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.520> go<00:05:55.669> the<00:05:55.879> cube<00:05:56.120> is

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
you invert it there you go the cube is

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.489 
you invert it there you go the cube is
solved<00:05:56.569> for<00:05:57.789> parity<00:05:58.789> it's<00:05:59.210> very<00:05:59.539> easy<00:05:59.839> parity

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
solved for parity it's very easy parity

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.700 
solved for parity it's very easy parity
is<00:06:00.589> also<00:06:00.919> easy<00:06:01.099> all<00:06:01.669> you<00:06:02.029> want<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.360> do<00:06:02.479> is<00:06:02.870> you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
is also easy all you want to do is you

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.600 
is also easy all you want to do is you
want<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.039> do<00:06:04.159> it<00:06:04.309> twice<00:06:05.050> there<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.139> go

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
want to do it twice there you go

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.959 
want to do it twice there you go
