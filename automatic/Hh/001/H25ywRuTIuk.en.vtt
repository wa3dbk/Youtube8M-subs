00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.380
 the human brain during its life 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.669
 it usually goes through 5 important structural phases 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.929
 brain configurations 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.229
 that lead to the birth and development of human consciousness 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.510
 already during pregnancy 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.950
 the brain develops along with the rest of the body 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.390
 the brain absorbs the first information without special filters 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.289
 adapts to the external environment 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 without prejudice a prejudice 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.490
 it's very responsive 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.179
 does not possess qualities such as and rationality 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.300
 login 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 I answer you directly to happy stimuli 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.950
 In this sentence 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.020
 the child is not yet aware of himself 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.310
 does not recognize itself in the mirror 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 and like a cat, he looks at the reflection thinking he sees another child 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.750
 the brain has built a first solid brain base and information 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900
 a first me 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050
 a first conscience 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.140
 which also represents his first data-reaction bramble center 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.000
 the response to external stimuli is no longer necessarily necessary 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.730
 direct and reactive 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.830
 but it passes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.730
 always more often 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.830
 through the filter of this cerebral passage 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.289
 which begins to process and influence the answer up 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.890
 this training base 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 becomes an interior reference point 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
 for your own actions 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.879
 it is the absolutely most delicate phase 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.279
 a format is a continuous risk of destruction life 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.869
 of megalomania 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.739
 to become pro pages of another view 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.859
 to become on sale 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:31.260
 parents are the educators for the custodians of this ego until they do not 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:32.939
 it is independent 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.839
 however, they do not fulfill this training task 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.439
 for carelessness 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.329
 actual ita patch ita 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.989
 uff malice 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.499
 with the consequence that their children 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:49.470
 last age scenes will be found at 20 30 40 years 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.300
 robot for life 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300
 in the state drawings independence 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.599
 uniro who has achieved brain independence 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.619
 hardly manipulate them 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.379
 present himself 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.399
 of relationship with the heart 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:09.079
 aware 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.189
 brain independence 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.180
 does not necessarily mean irs of bruises from the florences and the environment 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.579
 around 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.209
 but it means to be aware 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.719
 the influence of the environment around
