 boxing in this video I'm not going to stop 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.199
 here with the game we will dedicate your 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.640
 fortnight as soon as we have a gap 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.440
 to kerosene a boxing so you can see that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.619
 there is in this box in this andress game 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.659
 aggression and gianluca santopietro andratx 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.900
 aggression in case it sounds like something 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.060
 name is the author of one of the best 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 for my taste games of grams or of 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.530
 board depending on how we look at the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.340
 catalog in this case of entertainment 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.740
 and sporting in sports told me with this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.840
 chemical an excellent game that already 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.030
 we will also speak inside of which we 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.729
 let's open the box to remove this 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.710
 seal of 15 x festival that bear here 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.009
 a hp lovecraft can not be otherwise 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.009
 way 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.020
 we need the plastic and we are going to open 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 the box 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 we open the box of tips for festival we 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.799
 it says here by the way a scary 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.280
 festival awaits you in the created city 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 by the gentleman of brians craft and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.710
 inside we find in the first place the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 bill regulation and rebalanced everything 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.709
 color the first time I see it without 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.630
 to doubt something because it is because I am 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.399
 watching right now with new others by 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.439
 first time good looks pretty good 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.950
 maquetado with few images that yes 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 because there are some and with a letter 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.670
 there are some are some parts that have 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 a handwritten letter a bit 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.120
 hard to read and we'll see how 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.069
 answer this manual in the part of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.940
 back a summary of josue at the moment 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.530
 it looks good here we have a sheet but 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.630
 just a sheet of die-cut cardboard 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.970
 these I'm not mistaken are the different 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 the different sects the players that 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.130
 they go by colors yellow red violet 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.840
 black and green and black well like good 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.510
 so that he sees it like this is blue and what 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.510
 we will see 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.250
 four chips must be markers and for 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.470
 another of these are locations we give 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.930
 the turn actually looks like black 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.970
 yellow red violet black and green 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 these four markers here these 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.420
 buildings out of 16 that represent 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.060
 different locations in king sport 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.830
 game board four bullets open it 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.780
 it is called at a glance remembers a little 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.550
 the board alcampo 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.500
 but good much smaller, of course 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.170
 look there we have locations with 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.080
 symbols of cults for what I see and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.560
 some more symbol we have a series of 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.349
 accounts and here are some here 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.260
 we have another this and free seems the 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.310
 typical classic dotted account more 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.220
 accounts on this side 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.780
 and here we will give a flight that I imagine that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.190
 will be for the letters at the end of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.140
 board as he said reminds the one of arkham 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.310
 because it represents the people I imagine that 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.440
 the town of kings port with the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.680
 locations and the connections between 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680
 they 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.620
 we close the board and below we find 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.780
 the other components letters 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.610
 few are we going to try to open them 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.480
 without doing much mess it seems that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.020
 they have easy open 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.840
 it holds 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.490
 here and we have a lot of letters in 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.490
 size so down I would say that that American 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.600
 American standard forgiveness mini a 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.600
 pretty good touch 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.300
 as you can see there are different types 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.460
 Researchers imagine that we will 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.900
 they say here okay these are the bad guys 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.680
 because this game works the other way around 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.570
 I tell you a little more 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.970
 here we have letters I understand that for the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.430
 violet player 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:19.169
 because they are spells for black player 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.669
 to red or yellow and white player or 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.669
 gray or whatever this is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.060
 Y 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.360
 we have a few more letters that are 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.400
 festivals festival letters and here 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.310
 five colors the five cards of 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.340
 reference is worth this as far as in 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.100
 As for loads as you see a few 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.130
 besides these letters we have a bag 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.710
 full of chips viscously 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.780
 quite large cylinders and cubes of 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.060
 colors so I see are all the 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.400
 colors there and there are some white yes 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.110
 same white and there is none of the 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.580
 five with the silk to mark the turn 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.939
 vacuum 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.009
 dice also for the three players 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.200
 violets three blacks three green three 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.140
 yellows and three reds 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.180
 and some chips that are just misleading are 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.180
 the gods we are going to take out the paper 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.400
 and it tells us if they are the 20 gods to the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.310
 we find our friend here is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.800
 say here is the isaf to see if it is 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.800
 here our friend and neighbor here is 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.470
 On the other hand, moody's has a text and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.169
 these are the gods that we have to 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.699
 invoke in this fifth festival 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.800
 You have already seen a content 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.499
 lacking plastic but what does it look like 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.719
 interesting is a game for 3 to 5 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.310
 players and what places us as you have 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.169
 seen on the other side we are the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.569
 sectarians are the bad guys we have to 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.939
 invoke the primal god before 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.029
 the researchers touch feet come to 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:56.060
 destroy our plans evil is the other 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:58.189
 side of arkamo of the right error as 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.270
 you see the game has a board with 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:05.990
 locations and distills true touch me 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.639
 remember Kirchner from the same author in 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.860
 certain touches as the measure of 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.289
 board the color data the chips 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.569
 even the cards but good is a 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.190
 logically different game you have already 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.080
 seen the content and 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.360
 He does not know how to tell us when but 9 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.820
 we will dedicate its corresponding fortnight 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.090
 to this new game based on exit moya 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.560
 in the work of the immortal hp lovecraft 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.330
 well nothing else tomorrow we continue with my 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.320
 drive quest do not miss it 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.320
 thanks for your time
