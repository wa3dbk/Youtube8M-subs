00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.810 

during<00:00:01.079> my<00:00:01.110> years<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.650> experimentation<00:00:02.280> with

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
during my years of experimentation with

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.970 
during my years of experimentation with
food<00:00:03.060> I've<00:00:03.659> discovered<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.319> i<00:00:04.470> like<00:00:04.740> food

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
food I've discovered that i like food

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.650 
food I've discovered that i like food
best<00:00:05.310> when<00:00:05.609> it's<00:00:05.790> cooked<00:00:06.029> for<00:00:06.299> shorter

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
best when it's cooked for shorter

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.020 
best when it's cooked for shorter
periods<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:07.290> time<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.760> lower

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
periods of time or at a lower

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970 
periods of time or at a lower
temperature<00:00:09.150> than<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.139> official<00:00:10.440> cooking

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
temperature than the official cooking

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.490 
temperature than the official cooking
temperatures<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.450> here's<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.809> method<00:00:13.320> for

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
temperatures so here's my method for

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.890 
temperatures so here's my method for
cooking<00:00:13.650> eggs<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:15.120> method<00:00:15.389> doesn't

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
cooking eggs and this method doesn't

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
cooking eggs and this method doesn't
leave<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> greasy<00:00:16.350> pan<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.279> clean<00:00:17.520> up

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
leave a greasy pan to clean up

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.170 
leave a greasy pan to clean up
afterwards<00:00:19.100> first<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.340> heat<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> pot<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.820> water

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
afterwards first you heat a pot of water

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380 
afterwards first you heat a pot of water
to<00:00:21.330> about<00:00:21.710> 160<00:00:22.710> degrees<00:00:23.010> Fahrenheit<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:23.699> about

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit or about

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.560 
to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit or about
72<00:00:25.080> degrees<00:00:25.410> Celsius<00:00:25.920> then<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.060> turn<00:00:27.300> off<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
72 degrees Celsius then you turn off the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.910 
72 degrees Celsius then you turn off the
heat<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> put<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> eggs<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.410> temperature

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
heat and put the eggs in the temperature

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
heat and put the eggs in the temperature
will<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.489> drop<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.510> you'll<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.780> to

will start to drop so you'll have to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780 
will start to drop so you'll have to
turn<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> heat<00:00:34.440> back<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.219> order<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
turn the heat back on in order to get it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.910 
turn the heat back on in order to get it
back<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.270> 160<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.170> 165<00:00:37.860> degrees

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.020 

leave<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.410> eggs<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.920> pan<00:00:45.950> for<00:00:46.220> about<00:00:46.489> 10

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
leave the eggs in the pan for about 10

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.220 
leave the eggs in the pan for about 10
minutes<00:00:48.550> then<00:00:49.550> crack<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.180> eggs<00:00:50.390> into<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.780> warm

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
minutes then crack the eggs into a warm

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.760 
minutes then crack the eggs into a warm
bowl<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:53.110> don't<00:00:54.110> know<00:00:54.230> if<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.530> these

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
bowl I don't know if it's these

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.189 
bowl I don't know if it's these
particular<00:00:55.160> eggs<00:00:55.550> or<00:00:55.879> if<00:00:56.540> it's<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:56.870> cooking

particular eggs or if it's this cooking

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.650 
particular eggs or if it's this cooking
method<00:00:57.520> but<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.670> eggs<00:00:58.820> don't<00:00:59.120> crack<00:00:59.390> very

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
method but the eggs don't crack very

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.509 
method but the eggs don't crack very
easily<00:00:59.900> because<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.710> membrane<00:01:01.129> under<00:01:01.430> the

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
easily because the membrane under the

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.009 
easily because the membrane under the
shell<00:01:01.760> seems<00:01:02.150> to<00:01:02.300> have<00:01:02.390> gained<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.839> lot<00:01:02.960> of

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.770 
shell seems to have gained a lot of
strength<00:01:03.530> sometimes<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.850> egg<00:01:05.030> shells<00:01:05.420> peel

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
strength sometimes the egg shells peel

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.749 
strength sometimes the egg shells peel
off<00:01:06.020> without<00:01:06.590> cracking<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.369> membrane<00:01:09.759> but

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
off without cracking the membrane but

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.399 
off without cracking the membrane but
when<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:11.300> them<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.570> crack<00:01:11.810> properly

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
when you get them to crack properly

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.410 
when you get them to crack properly
you'll<00:01:12.950> discover<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.759> white<00:01:13.970> part<00:01:14.300> of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
you'll discover that the white part of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.300 
you'll discover that the white part of
the<00:01:14.540> egg<00:01:14.720> will<00:01:14.990> be<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> thick<00:01:15.530> liquid<00:01:15.770> rather

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
the egg will be a thick liquid rather

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.520 
the egg will be a thick liquid rather
than<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.550> solid<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.330> yolk<00:01:18.110> will<00:01:18.410> be

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
than a solid and the yolk will be

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.200 
than a solid and the yolk will be
completely<00:01:19.070> liquid<00:01:19.899> if<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:22.729> want<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.060> white

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
completely liquid if you want the white

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.570 
completely liquid if you want the white
part<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.750> be<00:01:23.869> more<00:01:24.170> solid<00:01:24.710> increase<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
part to be more solid increase the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.520 
part to be more solid increase the
temperature<00:01:25.910> by<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> few<00:01:26.539> degrees<00:01:29.289> one<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.410> the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
temperature by a few degrees one of the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.680 
temperature by a few degrees one of the
advantages<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.250> cooking<00:01:31.759> eggs<00:01:31.970> like<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.479> is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
advantages of cooking eggs like this is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.900 
advantages of cooking eggs like this is
that<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.080> don't<00:01:33.289> have<00:01:33.440> any<00:01:33.770> greasy<00:01:34.310> pans<00:01:34.610> to

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
that you don't have any greasy pans to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.149 
that you don't have any greasy pans to
clean

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
clean

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.250 
clean
then<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.460> add<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:38.970> salt<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> stir<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
then I add a little salt and stir the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.620 
then I add a little salt and stir the
mixture<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> fork<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.390> suppose<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
mixture with a fork I suppose this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.030 
mixture with a fork I suppose this
mixture<00:01:43.049> could<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.409> described<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
mixture could be described as a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.149 
mixture could be described as a
low-temperature<00:01:44.850> egg<00:01:45.330> soup<00:01:45.690> or<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.650> base

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
low-temperature egg soup or as a base

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
low-temperature egg soup or as a base
for<00:01:47.460> custard<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.570> tastes<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.170> perfectly

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
for custard it tastes like perfectly

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
for custard it tastes like perfectly
cooked<00:01:53.280> scrambled<00:01:53.880> eggs<00:01:54.060> without<00:01:54.659> any

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
cooked scrambled eggs without any

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
cooked scrambled eggs without any
contamination<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.250> burnt<00:01:56.520> grease<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:58.520> love<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
contamination of burnt grease I love the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
contamination of burnt grease I love the
flavor<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> sometimes<00:02:01.170> eat<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
flavor so much that I sometimes eat it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
flavor so much that I sometimes eat it
just<00:02:02.040> as<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.360> could<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
just as it is you could put it in the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
just as it is you could put it in the
glass<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.680> drink<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> goes<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
glass and drink it but then it goes so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.090 
glass and drink it but then it goes so
quickly<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.050> don't<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> enjoy<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
quickly that you don't get to enjoy it
