00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
home it's just a temporary system all

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.460 
home it's just a temporary system all
right<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.150> finished<00:01:28.390> my<00:01:28.450> new<00:01:28.600> sub<00:01:28.870> box<00:01:29.080> for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
right I just finished my new sub box for

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.090 
right I just finished my new sub box for
my<00:01:29.500> temporary<00:01:30.070> build<00:01:31.410> I'm<00:01:32.410> not<00:01:32.650> too<00:01:32.800> sure

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
my temporary build I'm not too sure

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.190 
my temporary build I'm not too sure
about<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.490> size<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.300> was<00:01:34.780> aiming<00:01:35.170> for

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
about the size of it I was aiming for

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.020 
about the size of it I was aiming for
for<00:01:35.920> for<00:01:36.100> cubic<00:01:36.430> foot<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:38.320> unfortunately<00:01:39.220> I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
for for cubic foot but unfortunately I

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.969 
for for cubic foot but unfortunately I
don't<00:01:40.479> think<00:01:40.600> they're<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.470> our<00:01:41.650> kind<00:01:41.860> of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
don't think they're like our kind of

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.410 
don't think they're like our kind of
bends<00:01:42.160> here<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.520> didn't<00:01:42.760> notice<00:01:42.910> that<00:01:43.210> at

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
bends here and I didn't notice that at

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.160 
bends here and I didn't notice that at
first<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.880> side<00:01:46.119> panels<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:46.750> made<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.080> to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
first so the side panels I made it to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.650 
first so the side panels I made it to
fit<00:01:47.350> above<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.369> but<00:01:49.060> I'm<00:01:49.150> supposed<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.390> go<00:01:49.479> to

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
fit above that but I'm supposed to go to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.859 
fit above that but I'm supposed to go to
up<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.050> here<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:51.190> i<00:01:51.220> just<00:01:51.310> shorten<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.820> up<00:01:51.940> from

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
up to here so i just shorten it up from

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.280 
up to here so i just shorten it up from
38<00:01:53.380> inches<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.950> 26<00:01:54.369> inches<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.869> i'll<00:01:55.990> get<00:01:56.200> to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
38 inches to 26 inches so i'll get to

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.980 
38 inches to 26 inches so i'll get to
the<00:01:56.410> calculations<00:01:57.070> later<00:01:57.460> there<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.780> that's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
the calculations later there but that's

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.669 
the calculations later there but that's
it<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.380> i<00:01:59.800> must<00:01:59.979> say<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:01.000> lot<00:02:01.390> louder<00:02:01.690> it

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
it and i must say it is a lot louder it

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.150 
it and i must say it is a lot louder it
hits<00:02:03.039> harder<00:02:03.490> than<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.289> 1.25<00:02:05.289> cubic<00:02:05.770> foot<00:02:05.950> box

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
hits harder than the 1.25 cubic foot box

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.290 
hits harder than the 1.25 cubic foot box
i<00:02:06.369> had<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.759> in<00:02:06.910> before<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:09.070> lets<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.880> listen<00:02:10.060> to
