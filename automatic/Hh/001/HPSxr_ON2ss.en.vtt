00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
achievements in the 360 version and I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.269 
achievements in the 360 version and I
assume<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.859> trophies<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
assume this is one of the trophies in

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.109 
assume this is one of the trophies in
the<00:00:17.369> ps3<00:00:17.789> version<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:19.730> complete<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> first

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the ps3 version is to complete the first

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.890 
the ps3 version is to complete the first
level<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.630> under<00:00:22.170> 60<00:00:22.740> seconds<00:00:23.189> under<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.490> minute

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
level in under 60 seconds under a minute

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.880 
level in under 60 seconds under a minute
so<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.529> right<00:00:25.590> now

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so we're going to do that right now

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.279 
so we're going to do that right now
let's<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.550> started<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.199> do

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
let's get started what I'm going to do

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
let's get started what I'm going to do
is<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> play<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.830> once<00:00:29.429> fast<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is I'm going to play this once fast and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.840 
is I'm going to play this once fast and
then<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.660> slowly<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.500> worm<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
then go through it slowly to worm so the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.830 
then go through it slowly to worm so the
fast<00:00:33.030> version<00:00:33.120> i'll<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.510> give<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.660> an<00:00:33.780> idea

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
fast version i'll just give you an idea

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.240 
fast version i'll just give you an idea
of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> path<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.440> took<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> slow

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of the path I took and then the slow

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
of the path I took and then the slow
version<00:00:35.460> I'll<00:00:35.940> explain<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:36.989> let's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
version I'll explain some more let's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
version I'll explain some more let's
play<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.100> more<00:00:38.370> detail<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
play in more detail because then some of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.190 
play in more detail because then some of
things<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> bit<00:00:40.649> weird<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.760> understand<00:00:42.270> any

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
things are a bit weird to understand any

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
things are a bit weird to understand any
way<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> want<00:00:43.559> basically<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> highest

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
way you want basically take the highest

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
way you want basically take the highest
path<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.050> find<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> did

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
path you can find which is what I did

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
path you can find which is what I did
and<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> went<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and this is just how I went through it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
and this is just how I went through it
that<00:00:50.070> might<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.430> able<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.610> puff<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that might be able to puff to do it I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.420 
that might be able to puff to do it I
try<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> literally<00:00:52.530> hours<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:53.129> find<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
try it for literally hours to find this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
try it for literally hours to find this
path<00:00:53.870> because<00:00:54.870> i<00:00:54.930> couldn't<00:00:55.170> find<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> path

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
path because i couldn't find this path

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.810 
path because i couldn't find this path
for<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> while<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> find

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
for a while because you have to find

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.260 
for a while because you have to find
that<00:00:56.940> spring<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.539> stone<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.210> do

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that spring is it not stone and I do

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.549 
that spring is it not stone and I do
make<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> lot<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> screw-ups<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> path

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
make a lot of screw-ups on this path

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
make a lot of screw-ups on this path
like<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.370> my<00:01:02.520> first<00:01:02.789> major

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
like there that's my first major

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670 
like there that's my first major
screw-up<00:01:03.449> where<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> spin<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.500> get

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
screw-up where I have to spin up to get

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
screw-up where I have to spin up to get
that<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.580> hill<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> still<00:01:09.000> do

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that little hill but you know I still do

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030 
that little hill but you know I still do
it<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.710> leeway<00:01:10.890> on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it so there is a little bit of leeway on

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
it so there is a little bit of leeway on
how<00:01:11.310> much<00:01:11.430> time<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:12.240> button<00:01:12.840> there

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
how much time you can use button there

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.469 
how much time you can use button there
is<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.380> much<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.000> think<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.060> screw<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.299> again

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
is not much I think I screw up again

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.140 
is not much I think I screw up again
there<00:01:16.100> by<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.520> enemy<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> probably

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there by going into enemy I probably

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
there by going into enemy I probably
should<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.479> homing<00:01:19.200> spinned<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:19.979> book

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
should have homing spinned that one book

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.380 
should have homing spinned that one book
oh<00:01:20.570> well<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> main

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
oh well and now we get back to the main

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
oh well and now we get back to the main
path<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.200> causing<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
path and you can see I'm causing it very

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
path and you can see I'm causing it very
close<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.479> 50<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> seconds<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
close as you can see 50 I seconds and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.090 
close as you can see 50 I seconds and
there<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:28.920> 59<00:01:29.610> seconds<00:01:30.090> 49<00:01:30.770> what<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there we go 59 seconds 49 what are the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
there we go 59 seconds 49 what are the
milliseconds<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.869> milliseconds<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
milliseconds not milliseconds this is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.590 
milliseconds not milliseconds this is
hundredths<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> seconds<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> was

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
hundredths of seconds I think so I was

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.950 
hundredths of seconds I think so I was
very<00:01:39.630> close<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.680> screwed<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.040> twice<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
very close and I screwed up twice but it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
very close and I screwed up twice but it
probably<00:01:43.259> improved<00:01:43.619> upon<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.759> now

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
probably improved upon you know I'm now

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
probably improved upon you know I'm now
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> play<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
going to play it once more and you can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to play it once more and you can
see<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> got<00:01:47.159> achievements<00:01:47.610> unlocked<00:01:47.670> no

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
see you got achievements unlocked no

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.940 
see you got achievements unlocked no
gonna<00:01:48.630> play<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.899> once<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.320> um<00:01:51.619> slower<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
gonna play it once more um slower and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.730 
gonna play it once more um slower and
with<00:01:53.310> some<00:01:53.579> pauses<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:55.290> explain

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
with some pauses just to really explain

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.120 
with some pauses just to really explain
what's<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.759> each<00:01:56.850> point<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.130> let's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
what's going on at each point so let's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
what's going on at each point so let's
go<00:01:59.310> back<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> very<00:01:59.850> beginning<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.810> from

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
go back to the very beginning so from

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
go back to the very beginning so from
the<00:02:01.500> start<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.070> soon<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> start<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.570> need

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the start as soon as you start you need

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
the start as soon as you start you need
to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.840> holding<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.560> obviously<00:02:05.189> but

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to be holding down right obviously but

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.910 
to be holding down right obviously but
there's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> much<00:02:07.079> faster<00:02:07.350> way<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> gain

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there's a much faster way to gain

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
there's a much faster way to gain
momentum<00:02:08.009> than<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.640> holding<00:02:08.940> right<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
momentum than just holding right if you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.949 
momentum than just holding right if you
do<00:02:10.140> homing<00:02:10.530> attacks<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.750> jump<00:02:12.750> home

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
do homing attacks like this jump home

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.510 
do homing attacks like this jump home
jump

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
jump

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
jump
like<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:15.110> can<00:02:15.790> move<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.970> lot<00:02:17.180> faster<00:02:17.230> than

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
like that you can move a lot faster than

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.490 
like that you can move a lot faster than
just<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:20.660> if<00:02:20.810> you're<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.050> holding<00:02:21.200> right

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
just that if you're just holding right

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
just that if you're just holding right
so<00:02:21.830> that's<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.250> good<00:02:22.610> way<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.820> gain

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so that's a really good way to gain

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.420 
so that's a really good way to gain
momentum<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> keep<00:02:24.470> momentum<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.190> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
momentum and to keep momentum and to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.840 
momentum and to keep momentum and to
give<00:02:25.610> yourself<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:25.940> boost<00:02:26.270> later<00:02:26.570> on<00:02:26.810> so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
give yourself a little boost later on so

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.220 
give yourself a little boost later on so
you<00:02:28.850> should<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.570> have<00:02:29.750> enough<00:02:29.960> tough

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
you should you do just have enough tough

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.560 
you should you do just have enough tough
enough<00:02:30.530> space<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:31.160> two<00:02:31.430> homing<00:02:31.880> attacks<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
enough space to do two homing attacks to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.750 
enough space to do two homing attacks to
gain<00:02:32.750> momentum<00:02:32.900> before<00:02:33.860> your<00:02:34.160> first<00:02:34.310> bad<00:02:34.550> Nick

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
gain momentum before your first bad Nick

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.120 
gain momentum before your first bad Nick
comes<00:02:34.970> along<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.500> jump<00:02:36.890> over

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
comes along and then you just jump over

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.340 
comes along and then you just jump over
that<00:02:37.220> easily<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.210> when<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
that easily and when you get to that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.590 
that easily and when you get to that
round<00:02:39.680> pill<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.460> run<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.480> will

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
round pill you run up it and it will

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.870 
round pill you run up it and it will
launch<00:02:42.260> into<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> air<00:02:42.770> when<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.580> get<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
launch into the air when you get to the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.700 
launch into the air when you get to the
very<00:02:43.910> top<00:02:44.480> then<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.020> need<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> use<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> homing

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
very top then you need to use a homing

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.470 
very top then you need to use a homing
attack<00:02:45.770> there<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:47.150> put<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.360> on

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
attack there and that will put you on

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.020 
attack there and that will put you on
this<00:02:47.800> platform<00:02:48.800> here<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.490> run<00:02:49.700> along<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
this platform here just run along the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.130 
this platform here just run along the
rise<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.240> platform<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.720> you'll<00:02:50.840> get<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
rise the platform and you'll get on the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.860 
rise the platform and you'll get on the
spring<00:02:51.530> system<00:02:52.010> keep<00:02:53.000> holding<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:53.570> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
spring system keep holding right and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.450 
spring system keep holding right and
you'll<00:02:53.990> just<00:02:54.380> don't<00:02:54.950> use<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> homing<00:02:55.430> attack

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
you'll just don't use a homing attack

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.010 
you'll just don't use a homing attack
while<00:02:56.210> you're<00:02:56.330> going<00:02:56.450> up<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> springs<00:02:56.870> I've

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
while you're going up the springs I've

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.960 
while you're going up the springs I've
made<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.320> mistake<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.650> few<00:02:57.860> times<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.850> just

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
made that mistake a few times you just

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.450 
made that mistake a few times you just
need<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.210> hold<00:02:59.330> right<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.690> those<00:02:59.840> Springs<00:03:00.460> then

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
need to hold right on those Springs then

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.500 
need to hold right on those Springs then
you<00:03:01.550> will<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.760> propelled<00:03:01.970> into<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.270> air<00:03:02.390> again

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
you will be propelled into the air again

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.140 
you will be propelled into the air again
on<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.260> one<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.980> need<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.460> do<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.850> homing

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
on this one you need to do a homing

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.850 
on this one you need to do a homing
attack<00:03:05.210> just<00:03:05.900> as<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.230> start<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.680> come<00:03:06.830> down

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
attack just as you start to come down

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.240 
attack just as you start to come down
around<00:03:07.700> about<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.620> see<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.830> was<00:03:09.920> just

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
around about there so you see I was just

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.710 
around about there so you see I was just
moving<00:03:10.430> down<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.730> little<00:03:11.090> bit<00:03:11.270> just<00:03:11.450> before<00:03:11.660> I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
moving down a little bit just before I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.650 
moving down a little bit just before I
did<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.950> idea<00:03:13.310> behind<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
did that the idea behind this is it

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.110 
did that the idea behind this is it
should<00:03:14.930> give<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.320> enough<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:16.340> should<00:03:16.730> propel

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
should give you enough it should propel

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.550 
should give you enough it should propel
you<00:03:17.240> far<00:03:17.510> enough<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.810> just<00:03:17.990> get<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.170> over<00:03:18.290> that

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
you far enough to just get you over that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.260 
you far enough to just get you over that
platform<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.280> left<00:03:19.490> of<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.670> screen<00:03:19.760> there

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
platform on the left of the screen there

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.920 
platform on the left of the screen there
and<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:21.410> should<00:03:21.560> also<00:03:21.940> let<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.060> land<00:03:23.330> early

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
and it should also let you land early

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
and it should also let you land early
enough<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.830> run<00:03:25.100> up<00:03:25.220> that

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
enough so that you can just run up that

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.870 
enough so that you can just run up that
hill<00:03:25.700> thing<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:27.080> slope<00:03:27.500> thing<00:03:27.740> anyway<00:03:28.700> that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
hill thing the slope thing anyway that

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.540 
hill thing the slope thing anyway that
I'll<00:03:28.940> pull<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.120> into<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.390> air<00:03:29.480> again<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.550> you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
I'll pull you into the air again and you

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.100 
I'll pull you into the air again and you
can<00:03:31.670> probably<00:03:32.090> make<00:03:32.240> it<00:03:32.300> over<00:03:32.690> these<00:03:32.840> bad

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
can probably make it over these bad

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.330 
can probably make it over these bad
Knicks<00:03:33.350> but<00:03:33.500> i<00:03:33.530> decided<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.980> homing<00:03:34.280> attack

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
Knicks but i decided to homing attack

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.460 
Knicks but i decided to homing attack
the<00:03:34.670> last<00:03:34.850> one<00:03:35.000> anyway<00:03:35.420> just<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.230> be<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the last one anyway just to be on the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.590 
the last one anyway just to be on the
safe<00:03:36.709> side<00:03:37.030> then<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.120> just<00:03:38.240> land<00:03:38.420> on<00:03:38.510> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
safe side then you just land on the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.650 
safe side then you just land on the
platform<00:03:38.750> there<00:03:39.230> spring<00:03:39.830> up<00:03:39.950> there<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.550> couple

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
platform there spring up there a couple

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.240 
platform there spring up there a couple
of<00:03:41.660> how<00:03:41.810> many<00:03:41.870> ties<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.410> past<00:03:42.590> those<00:03:42.800> and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
of how many ties to get past those and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699 
of how many ties to get past those and
then<00:03:43.459> you've<00:03:43.580> got<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.700> spring<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.709> now

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
then you've got a spring there and now

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.350 
then you've got a spring there and now
that<00:03:46.130> there's<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.459> bit<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.670> flat<00:03:46.910> land<00:03:46.940> so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
that there's a bit of flat land so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.030 
that there's a bit of flat land so
you'll<00:03:47.480> want<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.720> do<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.050> jumping<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.680> homing

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
you'll want to do the jumping and homing

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
you'll want to do the jumping and homing
of<00:03:49.270> trick<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.300> couple<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.690> times

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.320 

so<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.130> get<00:03:54.250> on<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.340> spring<00:03:54.760> homing<00:03:55.270> attack

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
so you get on this spring homing attack

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.740 
so you get on this spring homing attack
and<00:03:56.220> then<00:03:57.220> you'll<00:03:57.340> call<00:03:57.490> this<00:03:57.640> Hill<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:58.360> top<00:03:58.660> of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and then you'll call this Hill on top of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.900 
and then you'll call this Hill on top of
this<00:03:58.810> hill<00:03:58.990> there<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> stone<00:03:59.830> used<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.670> jump

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
this hill there is a stone used to jump

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.130 
this hill there is a stone used to jump
on<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> stone<00:04:01.300> and<00:04:01.330> then<00:04:01.510> jump<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.870> spring

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
on the stone and then jump on the spring

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.070 
on the stone and then jump on the spring
in<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> stone<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.390> I've<00:04:04.390> tried<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.750> few

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
in the stone and I've tried a few

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.390 
in the stone and I've tried a few
different<00:04:05.140> paths<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.740> get<00:04:05.860> through<00:04:06.010> its<00:04:06.130> level

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
different paths to get through its level

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.670 
different paths to get through its level
and<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:07.120> top<00:04:07.540> path<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.140> only<00:04:08.290> one<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.620> I

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and this top path is the only one that I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.880 
and this top path is the only one that I
found<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.160> actually<00:04:09.250> worked<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:09.940> me<00:04:10.270> so<00:04:10.300> you

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
found that actually worked for me so you

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.990 
found that actually worked for me so you
know<00:04:11.890> this<00:04:11.980> top<00:04:12.190> path<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.460> find<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:12.850> lot

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
know this top path I find it a lot

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.640 
know this top path I find it a lot
simpler<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.510> lets<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:13.870> go<00:04:14.050> over<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> lot

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
simpler it lets you just go over a lot

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.640 
simpler it lets you just go over a lot
of<00:04:14.800> platforming<00:04:15.520> stuff<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.290> want<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.500> take

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
of platforming stuff so I want to take

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.170 
of platforming stuff so I want to take
this<00:04:17.680> spring<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.250> get<00:04:18.370> over<00:04:18.549> here<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.940> this

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
this spring to get over here and this

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.759 
this spring to get over here and this
top<00:04:19.630> path<00:04:19.810> basically<00:04:20.260> just<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.500> load<00:04:20.650> of

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
top path basically just a load of

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.530 
top path basically just a load of
Springs<00:04:20.890> they<00:04:21.670> can<00:04:21.820> see<00:04:21.940> there's<00:04:22.180> my<00:04:22.300> first

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
Springs they can see there's my first

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.260 
Springs they can see there's my first
major<00:04:22.690> fail<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.430> after<00:04:24.430> taking<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.820> second

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
major fail and after taking the second

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.450 
major fail and after taking the second
spring<00:04:25.540> on<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.720> top<00:04:25.930> bath<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.380> did<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> homing

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
spring on the top bath I did a homing

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.640 
spring on the top bath I did a homing
attack<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:28.510> was<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> bad<00:04:28.990> idea<00:04:29.020> because<00:04:29.440> it

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
attack that was a bad idea because it

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.410 
attack that was a bad idea because it
put<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:30.010> propelled<00:04:30.430> me<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.550> bit<00:04:30.790> too<00:04:30.940> far<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.330> I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
put it propelled me a bit too far and I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.780 
put it propelled me a bit too far and I
landed<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.380> slope<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.490> you'll<00:04:33.670> probably

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
landed on the slope so you'll probably

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.610 
landed on the slope so you'll probably
want<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.150> not<00:04:34.390> use<00:04:34.540> our<00:04:34.690> real<00:04:34.810> time<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.230> just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
want to not use our real time I just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.950 
want to not use our real time I just
have<00:04:35.800> time<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.070> you<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> spin<00:04:36.820> up<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.900> I

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
have time to you do a spin up so so I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.780 
have time to you do a spin up so so I
managed<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.380> salvage<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.640> go

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
managed to salvage that and then you go

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.210 
managed to salvage that and then you go
down<00:04:39.940> here<00:04:40.360> busts<00:04:40.690> through<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.930> wall<00:04:41.220> spring

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
down here busts through the wall spring

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.100 
down here busts through the wall spring
spring<00:04:42.850> now<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.300> need<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> be<00:04:43.690> careful

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
spring now you need to be careful

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.300 
spring now you need to be careful
because<00:04:44.170> there<00:04:44.470> are<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.590> couple<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.860> badniks

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
because there are a couple of badniks

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.010 
because there are a couple of badniks
coming<00:04:45.580> up<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:46.360> need<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.690> homing<00:04:46.960> attack

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
coming up you need to homing attack

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.870 
coming up you need to homing attack
though<00:04:47.350> otherwise<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.100> will<00:04:48.310> get<00:04:48.520> hit<00:04:48.700> by

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
though otherwise you will get hit by

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.050 
though otherwise you will get hit by
them<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:50.470> three<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.770> them<00:04:51.040> then<00:04:51.400> just<00:04:51.760> keep

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
them all three of them then just keep

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.940 
them all three of them then just keep
running<00:04:52.330> basically<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.650> get<00:04:53.800> this

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
running basically you get this

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.140 
running basically you get this
checkpoint<00:04:54.250> now<00:04:54.490> this<00:04:54.610> check<00:04:54.790> by<00:04:54.910> its<00:04:55.030> only

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
checkpoint now this check by its only

checkpoint now this check by its only
reachable<00:04:55.540> by<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:56.050> path<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:58.150> then<00:04:58.990> at

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
reachable by this path so and then at

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.960 
reachable by this path so and then at
this<00:04:59.200> point<00:04:59.320> you'll<00:04:59.890> run<00:05:00.400> into<00:05:00.430> a<00:05:00.610> bad<00:05:00.760> Nick

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
this point you'll run into a bad Nick

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.330 
this point you'll run into a bad Nick
probably<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:02.320> might<00:05:02.530> be<00:05:02.710> able<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.010> homing

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
probably you might be able to homing

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.950 
probably you might be able to homing
attack<00:05:03.400> without<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:04.090> get<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.390> top<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
attack without and get on top of the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.409 
attack without and get on top of the
loop<00:05:05.320> there<00:05:05.680> on<00:05:06.520> top<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.850> loop<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.090> did<00:05:07.240> see

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
loop there on top of the loop I did see

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.680 
loop there on top of the loop I did see
another<00:05:07.600> spring<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.320> can<00:05:08.440> see<00:05:08.650> they're

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
another spring as you can see they're

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.360 
another spring as you can see they're
not<00:05:10.690> sure<00:05:10.870> if<00:05:10.990> that's<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.260> shorter<00:05:11.830> path<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:12.310> I

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
not sure if that's a shorter path but I

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.590 
not sure if that's a shorter path but I
did<00:05:12.669> manage<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:13.120> do<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.990> way<00:05:14.260> so<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.510> then

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
did manage to do it this way so so then

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.670 
did manage to do it this way so so then
if<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:16.810> come<00:05:16.930> down<00:05:16.960> this<00:05:17.169> way<00:05:17.320> this<00:05:17.500> will

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
if you come down this way this will

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.500 
if you come down this way this will
connect<00:05:18.100> you<00:05:18.160> back<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.640> main<00:05:18.850> bottom<00:05:19.300> path

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
connect you back to the main bottom path

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.969 
connect you back to the main bottom path
again<00:05:20.640> just<00:05:22.140> land<00:05:23.140> on<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.320> spring<00:05:23.530> there<00:05:23.710> and

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
again just land on the spring there and

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.860 
again just land on the spring there and
then<00:05:24.070> a<00:05:24.100> couple<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.430> jumping<00:05:25.060> homes<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.630> you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
then a couple of jumping homes and you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.350 
then a couple of jumping homes and you
should<00:05:26.140> be<00:05:26.350> cross<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.430> finish<00:05:27.610> line<00:05:27.669> under<00:05:28.030> 60

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
should be cross the finish line under 60

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.780 
should be cross the finish line under 60
seconds<00:05:28.780> might<00:05:29.620> take<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.860> few<00:05:29.950> attempts<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.610> get

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
seconds might take a few attempts to get

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.180 
seconds might take a few attempts to get
the<00:05:31.120> path<00:05:31.450> right<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.260> get<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.710> jumping

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
the path right and to get the jumping

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.570 
the path right and to get the jumping
and<00:05:33.310> homing<00:05:33.610> right<00:05:34.590> took<00:05:35.590> me<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.740> freaking<00:05:36.430> long

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
and homing right took me a freaking long

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.170 
and homing right took me a freaking long
time<00:05:37.020> but<00:05:38.020> that's<00:05:38.200> how<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.320> did<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.620> I'm

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
time but that's how I did it I'm

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.040 
time but that's how I did it I'm
probably<00:05:40.180> not<00:05:40.390> gonna<00:05:40.510> do<00:05:40.600> anything<00:05:40.750> else<00:05:40.960> in

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
probably not gonna do anything else in

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.450 
probably not gonna do anything else in
this<00:05:41.110> episode<00:05:41.410> so<00:05:41.950> that's<00:05:42.400> pretty<00:05:43.300> much<00:05:43.390> it

think<00:05:51.810> this<00:05:52.810> deity<00:05:52.990> would<00:05:53.320> just<00:05:53.440> came<00:05:53.560> on

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
think this deity would just came on

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.140 
think this deity would just came on
screen<00:05:54.190> like<00:05:54.340> I<00:05:54.430> remember<00:05:54.850> what<00:05:54.940> it's<00:05:55.090> called

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150
