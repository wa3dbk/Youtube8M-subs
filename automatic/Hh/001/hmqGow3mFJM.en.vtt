favorites<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.369> chainsaw<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.779> straight

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
favorites a chainsaw it's a straight

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.400 
favorites a chainsaw it's a straight
diameter<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> chainsaw<00:00:29.400> file<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> half

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
diameter the chainsaw file and the half

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
diameter the chainsaw file and the half
rat<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> curved<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.600> side<00:00:33.899> flat

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
rat so it's a curved on one side flat

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
rat so it's a curved on one side flat
and<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.469> variety<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.980> nice<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and so it different variety is nice to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.260 
and so it different variety is nice to
have<00:00:39.410> we<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.149> the

have we do want to have a look at the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
have we do want to have a look at the
files<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.350> work<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:44.370> are

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
files that see how they work there are

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.350 
files that see how they work there are
teeth<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.360> cut<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.500> direction<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> much

previous video we have cut and trimmed a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
previous video we have cut and trimmed a
fork<00:01:25.530> column<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.820> sharp<00:01:27.210> edge<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.869> the

fork column very sharp edge from the
other<00:01:28.409> hacksaw<00:01:28.829> blade<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.390> we're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
other hacksaw blade so here we're

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.740 
other hacksaw blade so here we're
holding<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> pushing<00:01:31.920> forward<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.600> also

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
holding and pushing forward you can also

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.870 
holding and pushing forward you can also
rotate<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.619> fork<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.329> give<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> nice

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
rotate the fork and give this a nice

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.410 
rotate the fork and give this a nice
nice<00:01:38.880> bevel<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> end<00:01:40.470> here

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
nice bevel right on the end here

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.200 
nice bevel right on the end here
eliminating<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> sharp<00:01:42.899> edge<00:01:43.140> allowing<00:01:43.950> our

compression cone and our top caps to go
right<00:01:48.659> over<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.079> top<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.600> again

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
right over the top of that so again

right over the top of that so again
filing<00:01:52.170> forward<00:01:53.149> that's<00:01:54.149> nice<00:01:56.270> inside<00:01:57.270> we

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
filing forward that's nice inside we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.090 
filing forward that's nice inside we
have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.630> sharp<00:01:57.960> edge<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.590> so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
have a sharp edge as well so

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.230 
have a sharp edge as well so
push<00:02:01.100> forward<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.940> drag<00:02:02.510> back<00:02:02.780> gently<00:02:03.290> and

push forward and drag back gently and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.720 
push forward and drag back gently and
that<00:02:05.240> eliminates<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.320> sharp<00:02:07.010> edge<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.580> the

bolt<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.530> secure<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.950> nut<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.190> there<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.930> when

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
bolt is secure the nut is there so when

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.260 
bolt is secure the nut is there so when
I<00:02:48.140> file<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.830> leaves<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.190> bird<00:02:49.490> we<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.910> bring<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
I file it leaves a bird we can bring the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.390 
I file it leaves a bird we can bring the
nut<00:02:50.450> up<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> help<00:02:51.110> clean<00:02:51.290> off<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.130> thread

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
nut up and help clean off the the thread

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.110 
nut up and help clean off the the thread
so<00:02:52.700> let's<00:02:53.600> get<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> different<00:02:54.050> file<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.760> in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
so let's get a different file here so in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.060 
so let's get a different file here so in
file<00:02:56.510> use<00:02:56.810> again<00:02:57.230> we're<00:02:57.470> saying<00:02:57.710> cutting

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
file use again we're saying cutting

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.390 
file use again we're saying cutting
forward<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.110> then<00:03:00.110> we're<00:03:00.350> coming<00:03:00.530> back<00:03:00.920> so

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
forward and then we're coming back so

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.670 
forward and then we're coming back so
this<00:03:01.550> would<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.870> would<00:03:03.080> be<00:03:03.200> good<00:03:03.380> it's

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
this would be this would be good it's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.880 
this would be this would be good it's
also<00:03:03.860> important<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.640> maintain<00:03:05.290> squareness<00:03:06.290> we

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
also important to maintain squareness we

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.680 
also important to maintain squareness we
want<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.890> not<00:03:10.100> not<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.790> what<00:03:10.940> I'm<00:03:11.090> doing<00:03:11.120> here

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
want to not not do what I'm doing here

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.840 
want to not not do what I'm doing here
we<00:03:11.810> are<00:03:11.930> cutting<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.560> angle<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:13.610> folding

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
we are cutting on it angle I'm folding

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.660 
we are cutting on it angle I'm folding
the<00:03:14.090> file<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.570> an<00:03:14.720> angle<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.260> then<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.220> cut<00:03:16.459> is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the file on an angle and then the cut is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
the file on an angle and then the cut is
now<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:17.150> an<00:03:17.300> angle<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.620> want<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.950> hold<00:03:19.690> hold

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
now on an angle so we want to hold hold

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.780 
now on an angle so we want to hold hold
flat<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:21.860> that's<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:22.550> be<00:03:22.640> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
flat so that's that would be the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.260 
flat so that's that would be the
procedure<00:03:23.209> at<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.440> end<00:03:25.030> when<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.150> were

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
satisfied with our length we could come

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.170 
satisfied with our length we could come
around<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:30.970> belleville<00:03:32.769> give<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.800> little

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
around and belleville give a little

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.160 
around and belleville give a little
angle<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.920> last<00:03:36.920> thread<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.090> then<00:03:38.170> back

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
angle to that last thread and then back

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.220 
angle to that last thread and then back

the sake of the jewelry getting hacked
up<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.279> damaged<00:05:38.729> also<00:05:39.599> getting<00:05:39.809> things

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:40.109 
up and damaged also getting things

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:42.409 
up and damaged also getting things
caught<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:40.679> damage<00:05:41.279> to<00:05:41.489> our<00:05:41.609> hands<00:05:42.239> the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
caught and damage to our hands the

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.049 
caught and damage to our hands the
different<00:05:42.839> machinery<00:05:43.319> we're<00:05:43.559> working<00:05:43.889> around

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:44.059 
different machinery we're working around

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.299 
different machinery we're working around
can<00:05:45.059> definitely<00:05:45.599> cause<00:05:45.809> cause<00:05:46.559> damage<00:05:47.069> there

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:47.309 
can definitely cause cause damage there

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.239 
can definitely cause cause damage there
so<00:05:47.579> we<00:05:47.699> can<00:05:47.819> find<00:05:48.059> a<00:05:48.319> spot<00:05:49.319> on<00:05:49.589> our<00:05:49.619> workbench

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:50.249 
so we can find a spot on our workbench

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.489 
so we can find a spot on our workbench
or<00:05:50.519> in<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.789> pocket<00:05:51.239> or<00:05:51.509> wherever<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.259> like

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:52.499 
or in the pocket or wherever you like

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.569 
or in the pocket or wherever you like
safely<00:05:53.099> there<00:05:53.779> second<00:05:54.779> thing<00:05:54.929> is<00:05:55.139> watches<00:05:55.709> get
