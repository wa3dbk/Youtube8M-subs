 delighted that he is with us 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.960
 tell us why an ere 32 because 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.560
 volkswagen good volkswagen comes then 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.040
 as in history all this that is remote 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.470
 in my car when I was 15 years old 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.200
 that was a volkswagen and volkswagen faw 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.100
 Golf GTI that I have still involved 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.860
 history car 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.840
 Well, always looking for how to continue with 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.330
 the chain, we were looking for a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 series 3 a series four series of the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.580
 that goes to look for the chain and until 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:42.590
 that counts it and 5 and because a ere 32 and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.710
 not a good gti 2.0 if I had followed 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 with the line I would surely have searched 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.170
 a gti from the same series, but 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.630
 it turns out that at this moment the cap of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.569
 line according to performance is not the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.300
 gti but slr 32 as you did for 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.700
 get an ere 32 that I know there's no 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 many r 32 in Colombia in fact or in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.590
 the world not even there how did you get 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.330
 one of 32 here and I looked for it a lot but 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.190
 as I found it with strains and I looked for it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.989
 because I started going to all the workshops 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.239
 to see when to see if they would give us here 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.910
 to make grand key hands go to 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.620
 look for a r 32 9 that end up sad in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.720
 a page of cars and says no 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.790
 I left looking for one or the first 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.860
 series of the second series 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.390
 but do not have to find and I already knew 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.329
 more or less of the existence of some 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.390
 and but there are people that we found 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.150
 The car was still very hot in 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 his furor and then why do I 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 I found this car these cars are that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 imported especially on some 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.299
 asked or how is the history of cars 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.189
 they have brought people in a way 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.140
 independent in ok since one can 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.450
 say to the volkswagen and say I want to 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.560
 Take out a cano on a request say bring 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 midfield 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.069
 and I said I want to bring 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 r 32 and they said no 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.379
 incredible not one would say that I have the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 silver bring me why not but all 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.280
 is based on the history of the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.460
 spare parts and that is that they have to sustain 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.130
 10 years 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.810
 and spare parts and maintenance you say by 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.370
 a single vehicle are not going to get in 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.340
 All models of entrepreneurs are 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.350
 understood with and let's see the heart of 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.570
 This is what the accounts that are in 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.850
 he really good here is where is the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.860
 charm of this device plus yes I'm going 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.180
 to believe now you are a 3,200 from 6 to 15 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.100
 degrees 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.090
 to 250 horsepower in conditions 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.790
 ideals 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.550
 and it has practically the history of 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.730
 pr 62 verza that hung fashionable in 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.970
 Colombia serving them if it was used in 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.069
 the stroke of erasing what these two 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.390
 motors since they were 2.8 of menorca berries and 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.680
 I think 190 horsepower is reached 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.239
 of 90 horses and 180 160 thousand seventy 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.209
 and peak of selling if the version was of 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.819
 2.8 2.9 I think this has traction in 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.269
 the four wheels that's the beauty of 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.729
 see what difference this identity card is 4x4 one 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.590
 review we have v6 engine 24 valves 250 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.830
 horsepower traction in the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.170
 four wheels on horses 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.020
 that is the exact r31 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.990
 this is the 110 edition of 5000 units 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.710
 sold in the world accompany a 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 back in the air 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.710
 i 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.410
