00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Talk about beauty here again for 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.150
 bring you another video about 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.830
 technology and this time we 're going 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.639
 Let's test the great launch of the year 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 gta 5 on the asus notebook heats 50 ln 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.500
 is equipped with an nvidia geforce 842 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.000
 memory jig 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 will this notebook go back to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 to play more anticipated games 2015 with good 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 fps 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.720
 but before province galera no 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.369
 forget to visit our new website 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 digital here the point with it visit 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 our video of the draw of the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.050
 quebec do brasil as soon as he 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 leaves beauty 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.680
 the way this is how it 's a game 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.600
 relatively difficult to rotate the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.750
 minimum requirements are a cpu 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.540
 core 2 quad an nvidia video card 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.070
 9800gt 1 gigabyte invest requirements 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.570
 you may even think that the game is light but 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.879
 remember that these pieces are for 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.870
 desktops when we talk about 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.089
 story is another 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.370
 unfortunately she's made a great cut 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.460
 of the game for pc it is being played in the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.790
 the most varied configurations. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.250
 notebook we tested is blue x 550 ln is 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.830
 equipped with an intel processor and 74 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.350
 1500 MB of 8 GB of RAM and one 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.060
 geforce 840 m 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.800
 we have tested these notebooks in several 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.369
 games that you can check here in this 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.440
 video 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.179
 but with the launch of gta5 it was so 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.679
 great that we decided to make a video only 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.960
 for this game 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.940
 well let's start first we will not 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.979
 we are in the games yet at least 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.380
 as few as possible resolution 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.450
 running with direct x 10 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.460
 this is important in direct x 11 staff 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.140
 it's heavier so I'm using 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.979
 the version 10 that we can win 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 some important fps with this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.940
 with this setting 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.580
 we get an average of 20 to 30 fps 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.640
 But quality is its textures 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.569
 very bad then we raise the resolution 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.520
 to 1,280 by 720 and in that resolution fps 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.390
 starts entering the 20's and 30's 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.580
 again 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.160
 well up to 30 which is fine 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.190
 playable but the textures are not as 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.390
 beautiful as my taste for who 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.819
 do not care much about the quality 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.050
 and wanting one more was 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.849
 stop here 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.709
 At this point the memory consumption is 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.560
 below the 900 mega already in resolution 1366 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.140
 by 768 we reached an average of 20 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.660
 open world species 17 environments with 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 water and closed space fps comes to beat 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.410
 25 and 30 on average 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.129
 moments the species fell to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.420
 low 17 affecting the gameplay a lot 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.129
 here we reach the maximum that the notebook 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.580
 managed to arrive at quality issues. 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:47.379
 versus fps and memory consumption is 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.900
 between 945 megawatts but we will stop for 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.000
 here as it as it is put that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.630
 very robust setup menu would 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.790
 a waste if we do not analyze 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.800
 and deeper as you can see 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.470
 I always kept everything in the minimum of each 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 option 25 and turned off and joking 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.440
 with their resolutions to see the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 memory consumption as it 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 behaved using the tests 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.830
 we have come to the conclusion that in 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.870
 1945 mega is the maximum that the notebook 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.180
 can use to have a performance 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.400
 reasonable then I started to play watch with 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.830
 how each resolution affects the consumption of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.380
 memory after all our tests 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.140
 we conclude that who wants to have better 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.080
 fluidity in the game should be between 880 and 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.600
 up to 905 megawatts of consumption 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.790
 who come to 985 I can play 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.560
 game satisfactorily 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.900
 It should also be noted that some reductions 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.760
 can consume more memory than 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.470
 the nations greater than that said of the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 proportion of the screen then 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.490
 attention to the consumption base that it 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.260
 it only increases sometimes 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.360
 increases then decreases a little later 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.700
 increases again and some of these two 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.190
 resolutions in the middle can be perfect 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
 For you again, notebook. 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.850
 impressed and proved capable of running 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.100
 same time all the solutions in the graph 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.380
 of spending at least one more time game 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.060
 and was launched now in 2015 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.370
 if you have managed to run gta in your 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 six notebooks have succeeded with solutions 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.660
 you used us are wanting 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.430
 then know ost in the comments beauty 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.290
 That's it for now, I hope. 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.480
 liked this video and system in the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.040
 channel to see more videos like this does not 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.870
 forget that you're going to get a 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.370
 This is going to make your cell phone soon. 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.200
 that we are going to upload a video explaining 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.940
 How will the draw work? 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.990
 we'll see you next time 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.990
 Thanks.
