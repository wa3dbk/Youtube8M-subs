each person is born with their fate

written into their own genetic code it's
unchangeable<00:00:11.849> immutable<00:00:14.120> but<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.330> not

all<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.260> life<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.630> finally<00:00:18.630> realized

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
all there is to life I finally realized

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.160 
all there is to life I finally realized
that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.020 

I<00:00:22.230> told<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> before<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.430> reason<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> was

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
I told you before the reason that I was

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.810 
I told you before the reason that I was
interested<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.570> genes<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> DNA<00:00:25.790> because<00:00:26.790> I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
interested in genes and DNA because I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.080 
interested in genes and DNA because I
wanted<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.270> know<00:00:27.300> who<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.600> was<00:00:28.220> where<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.430> came

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
wanted to know who I was where I came

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
wanted to know who I was where I came
from<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:32.930> thought<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> analyzed<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:35.070> DNA

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
from I thought that if I analyzed my DNA

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150 
from I thought that if I analyzed my DNA
I<00:00:35.880> could<00:00:36.090> find<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.600> who<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> was<00:00:37.040> who<00:00:38.040> my

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I could find out who I was who my

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580 
I could find out who I was who my
parents<00:00:38.489> were<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.960> thought<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
parents were and I thought that if I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
parents were and I thought that if I
knew<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.580> I<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:42.330> what<00:00:42.570> path<00:00:42.900> I<00:00:43.199> should

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
knew that then I know what path I should

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.070 
knew that then I know what path I should
take<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.710> life<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.370> wrong<00:00:47.580> I<00:00:48.080> didn't

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
take in life but I was wrong I didn't

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.979 
take in life but I was wrong I didn't
find<00:00:49.410> anything<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.340> didn't<00:00:51.120> learn<00:00:51.269> anything

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.320 

just<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.229> with<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.500> genome<00:00:55.949> soldiers<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
just like with the genome soldiers you

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.030 
just like with the genome soldiers you
can<00:00:57.479> input<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.440> genetic<00:00:58.890> information

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
can input all the genetic information

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.250 
can input all the genetic information
but<00:00:59.729> that<00:01:00.210> doesn't<00:01:00.540> make<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.930> into<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
but that doesn't make them into the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.160 
but that doesn't make them into the
strongest<00:01:01.680> soldiers<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> most<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.839> can<00:01:03.960> say

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
strongest soldiers the most we can say

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170 
strongest soldiers the most we can say
about<00:01:04.290> DNA<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> governs<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.760> person's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
about DNA is that it governs a person's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.200 
about DNA is that it governs a person's
