really and some of the cool stuff it

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.529 
really and some of the cool stuff it
comes<00:04:20.970> with<00:04:21.180> what<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.970> software<00:04:24.390> that

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
comes with what the the software that

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.210 
comes with what the the software that
comes<00:04:24.630> pre-installed

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
comes pre-installed

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.890 
comes pre-installed
and<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.470> think<00:04:28.560> well<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.040> i<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.250> show<00:04:29.490> you

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.540 

the<00:04:34.490> system<00:04:35.490> font<00:04:35.850> it's<00:04:36.330> been<00:04:36.570> made<00:04:36.810> smaller

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
the system font it's been made smaller

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.010 
the system font it's been made smaller
so<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.640> notice<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.420> if<00:04:39.540> i<00:04:39.660> go<00:04:39.780> into<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so you notice that if i go into the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.880 
so you notice that if i go into the
marketplace<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:41.070> fonts<00:04:41.760> not<00:04:41.970> as<00:04:42.090> large<00:04:42.330> and

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
marketplace the fonts not as large and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.590 
marketplace the fonts not as large and
also<00:04:43.890> shows<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.430> top<00:04:44.610> left<00:04:44.880> what<00:04:45.330> an

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
also shows in the top left what an

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.950 
also shows in the top left what an
application<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.560> use<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.820> menu<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.510> also

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
application you use in the menu is also

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.690 
application you use in the menu is also
quite<00:04:49.110> small<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.500> sometimes<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.580> got

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
quite small so sometimes if you got

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.000 
quite small so sometimes if you got
stuffed<00:04:50.940> with<00:04:51.090> huge<00:04:51.330> menus<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.080> loads<00:04:52.830> of

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
stuffed with huge menus and loads of

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.150 
stuffed with huge menus and loads of
options<00:04:53.910> then<00:04:54.680> it's<00:04:55.680> not<00:04:55.800> going<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.010> be<00:04:56.070> off

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
options then it's not going to be off

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.600 
options then it's not going to be off
the<00:04:56.310> screen<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.930> think<00:04:57.930> also<00:04:58.200> he's<00:04:58.500> tweaked<00:04:58.890> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.110 

settings<00:05:02.610> for<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:04.190> touch<00:05:05.190> screen<00:05:05.370> as<00:05:05.640> well<00:05:05.790> so

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
settings for the touch screen as well so

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.900 
settings for the touch screen as well so
it's<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.360> lot<00:05:06.510> smoother<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.470> kind<00:05:08.130> of<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.460> lot

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
it's a lot smoother so kind of a lot

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.610 
it's a lot smoother so kind of a lot

from<00:05:36.750> HTC<00:05:41.360> also<00:05:42.360> i<00:05:42.390> think<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:43.560> made<00:05:44.460> it<00:05:44.700> so<00:05:45.090> that

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
from HTC also i think is made it so that

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:53.150 
from HTC also i think is made it so that
the<00:05:48.229> messaging<00:05:49.229> app<00:05:51.620> uses<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.830> default

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
the messaging app uses the default

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.670 
the messaging app uses the default
windows<00:05:53.940> mobile<00:05:54.150> instead<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:54.900> HTC<00:05:55.410> Sense

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
windows mobile instead of the HTC Sense

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.960 
windows mobile instead of the HTC Sense
so<00:05:55.919> it's<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.100> lot<00:05:56.250> speedier<00:05:57.000> and<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:59.280> that's<00:05:59.760> by

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
so it's a lot speedier and and that's by

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.330
