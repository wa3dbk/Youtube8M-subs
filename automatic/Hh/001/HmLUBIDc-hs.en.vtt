and<00:00:31.840> turning<00:00:32.619> it<00:00:32.710> into<00:00:32.769> a<00:00:32.949> gain<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.460> bunch<00:00:33.850> of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
and turning it into a gain a bunch of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.600 
and turning it into a gain a bunch of
gain<00:00:34.180> like<00:00:34.420> 25<00:00:34.870> dB<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:36.070> came<00:00:36.250> up<00:00:36.400> with<00:00:36.519> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
gain like 25 dB and you came up with the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.969 
gain like 25 dB and you came up with the
idea<00:00:36.850> of<00:00:37.000> taking<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.989> circuit<00:00:38.379> itself<00:00:38.710> and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:38.979 
idea of taking the circuit itself and

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.439 
idea of taking the circuit itself and
removing<00:00:39.370> it<00:00:39.460> from<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.640> microphone<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.390> he

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
removing it from the microphone and he

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.969 
removing it from the microphone and he
makes<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.839> product<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.409> is<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.589> mic

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
makes this product this is a mic

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.590 
makes this product this is a mic
activator<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:42.970> is<00:00:43.089> in<00:00:43.239> fact<00:00:43.390> the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
activator and it is in fact the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.719 
activator and it is in fact the
electronics<00:00:44.110> from<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.350> mic<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.159> essentially

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
electronics from the mic so essentially

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.579 
electronics from the mic so essentially
if<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.970> feed<00:00:46.239> this<00:00:46.420> with<00:00:46.629> signal<00:00:47.080> with

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
if you feed this with signal with

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.380 
if you feed this with signal with
phantom<00:00:48.070> power<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.549> it<00:00:48.699> what<00:00:48.879> comes<00:00:49.059> out<00:00:49.239> is

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
phantom power in it what comes out is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.619 
phantom power in it what comes out is
the<00:00:49.510> same<00:00:49.720> signal<00:00:50.170> ultra<00:00:50.920> clean<00:00:51.190> 25<00:00:51.879> DB<00:00:52.390> hotter

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
the same signal ultra clean 25 DB hotter

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.340 
the same signal ultra clean 25 DB hotter
and<00:00:52.900> it's<00:00:53.470> available<00:00:53.680> in<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.220> mono<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.350> stereo

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
and it's available in a mono and stereo

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.979 
and it's available in a mono and stereo
version<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.280> mono<00:00:57.460> maps<00:00:57.790> for<00:00:57.970> 149<00:00:58.780> dollars

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
version the mono maps for 149 dollars

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
the stereo maps for 249 dollars but we

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.780 
the stereo maps for 249 dollars but we
had<00:01:02.470> people<00:01:02.619> asking<00:01:03.070> us<00:01:03.159> can<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.400> give<00:01:03.549> us<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
had people asking us can you give us a

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.250 
had people asking us can you give us a
finer<00:01:04.000> sense<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.420> control<00:01:04.720> with<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.049> would

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
finer sense of control with this would

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.380 
finer sense of control with this would
be<00:01:05.350> nice<00:01:05.619> so<00:01:06.340> Roger<00:01:06.549> came<00:01:06.850> up<00:01:06.969> with<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.210> this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
be nice so Roger came up with this this

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.240 
be nice so Roger came up with this this
is<00:01:07.450> his<00:01:07.689> newest<00:01:07.990> product<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.829> is<00:01:08.890> called<00:01:09.189> a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
is his newest product this is called a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.520 
is his newest product this is called a
cloud<00:01:09.490> lifter<00:01:09.880> Z<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.810> cloud<00:01:11.020> lift<00:01:11.229> jersey

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
cloud lifter Z and the cloud lift jersey

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.870 
cloud lifter Z and the cloud lift jersey
is<00:01:11.649> essentially<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.280> same<00:01:12.460> thing<00:01:12.520> as<00:01:12.759> the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
is essentially the same thing as the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.310 
is essentially the same thing as the
single<00:01:13.180> channel<00:01:13.329> cloud<00:01:13.659> lifter<00:01:13.990> as<00:01:14.079> you<00:01:14.200> can

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
single channel cloud lifter as you can

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.620 
single channel cloud lifter as you can
see<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:14.680> one<00:01:14.920> channel<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.579> out<00:01:15.700> but<00:01:16.420> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
see it's one channel in and out but it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.050 
see it's one channel in and out but it
gives<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.289> the<00:01:17.409> ability<00:01:17.679> to<00:01:17.920> match<00:01:18.789> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
gives you the ability to match the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.310 
gives you the ability to match the
impedance<00:01:19.539> of<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.780> microphone<00:01:20.200> that's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
impedance of the microphone that's

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.399 
impedance of the microphone that's
plugged<00:01:20.619> in<00:01:20.920> or<00:01:21.929> intentionally<00:01:22.929> mismatched

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
plugged in or intentionally mismatched

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.709 
plugged in or intentionally mismatched
the<00:01:23.710> impedance<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.850> kind<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.090> an<00:01:25.210> EQ<00:01:25.509> type

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
the impedance so for kind of an EQ type

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.959 
the impedance so for kind of an EQ type
of<00:01:25.869> effect<00:01:26.170> two<00:01:27.070> other<00:01:27.250> additions<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.789> the

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
of effect two other additions to the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.490 
of effect two other additions to the
cloud<00:01:28.149> lifter<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.810> cloud<00:01:28.990> lifters<00:01:29.350> he

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
cloud lifter that the cloud lifters he

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.160 
cloud lifter that the cloud lifters he
has<00:01:29.710> are<00:01:30.039> this<00:01:30.729> this<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.270> rumble<00:01:31.689> filter<00:01:31.990> so

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
has are this this is a rumble filter so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.300 
has are this this is a rumble filter so
if<00:01:32.259> you've<00:01:32.350> got<00:01:32.469> a<00:01:32.499> whole<00:01:32.619> bunch<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:32.979> low<00:01:33.130> end

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
if you've got a whole bunch of low end

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.190 
if you've got a whole bunch of low end
happening<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:33.939> kind<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.299> distorting

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
happening and it's kind of distorting

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
happening and it's kind of distorting
things<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.530> can<00:01:35.649> actually<00:01:35.920> roll<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.280> off

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
things you can actually roll that off

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.690 
things you can actually roll that off
but<00:01:37.689> it's<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.869> little<00:01:38.079> bit<00:01:38.200> more<00:01:38.549> musical<00:01:39.549> than

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
but it's a little bit more musical than

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.090 
but it's a little bit more musical than
