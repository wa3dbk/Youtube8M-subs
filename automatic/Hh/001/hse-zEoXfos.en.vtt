Gardens calm and today we're going to be
talking<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:05.339> fragging<00:00:06.060> favia<00:00:06.600> brain

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
talking about fragging favia brain

talking about fragging favia brain
corals<00:00:09.349> so<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:10.530> still<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> little<00:00:11.070> bit<00:00:11.219> up<00:00:11.370> in

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
corals so it's still a little bit up in

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.940 
corals so it's still a little bit up in
the<00:00:11.610> air<00:00:11.759> whether<00:00:12.090> favia<00:00:12.719> make<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.799> good

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the air whether favia make really good

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.799

the<00:00:16.529> major<00:00:16.770> issue<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.400> them<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the major issue with them is that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
the major issue with them is that
they're<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> slowest<00:00:19.380> growing<00:00:19.619> stony

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they're one of the slowest growing stony

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
they're one of the slowest growing stony
corals<00:00:20.400> out<00:00:20.580> there<00:00:21.410> still<00:00:22.410> they're<00:00:23.510> fairly

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
corals out there still they're fairly

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.429 
corals out there still they're fairly
easy<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.960> propagate<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.330> even<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:28.170> their

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
easy to propagate and even with their

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
easy to propagate and even with their
growth<00:00:29.010> rate<00:00:29.189> issues<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.570> learned

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
growth rate issues a lot can be learned

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.910 
growth rate issues a lot can be learned
from<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.289> practicing<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:31.949> them<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
from just practicing on them so as the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.620 
from just practicing on them so as the
title<00:00:35.130> indicated<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.210> using

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
title indicated we're going to be using

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a liquid-cooled diamond bladed bandsaw

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 
a liquid-cooled diamond bladed bandsaw
to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.770> cutting<00:00:41.040> these<00:00:41.129> corals<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.300> really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to be cutting these corals and it really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.330 
to be cutting these corals and it really
is<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.110> best<00:00:43.230> tool<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> job<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
is the best tool for the job here you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.069 
is the best tool for the job here you
can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.730> why<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.180> using<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> saw<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
can see here why I like using the saw so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
can see here why I like using the saw so
much<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.489> precise<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
much it's so precise that you can

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.189 
much it's so precise that you can
basically<00:00:51.840> isolate<00:00:52.770> single<00:00:52.980> polyps<00:00:54.199> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
basically isolate single polyps you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.540 
basically isolate single polyps you
would<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> saw<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
would think with the saw like this that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.799 
would think with the saw like this that
I<00:00:56.579> could<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.910> buzz<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.480> through<00:00:57.660> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I could just buzz right through this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
I could just buzz right through this
coral<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> reason<00:00:58.859> why<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.129> taking<00:00:59.460> my

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
coral but the reason why I'm taking my

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
coral but the reason why I'm taking my
time<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> particular<00:01:01.680> coral

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
time is because this particular coral

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.299 
time is because this particular coral
was<00:01:02.670> recently<00:01:03.300> imported<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.110> most<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
was recently imported and most of the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
was recently imported and most of the
time<00:01:05.549> corals<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.390> coming<00:01:06.630> straight<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
time corals are coming straight from the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
time corals are coming straight from the
ocean<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.830> much<00:01:08.189> denser<00:01:08.670> skeletons<00:01:09.240> than

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
ocean have much denser skeletons than

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.230 
ocean have much denser skeletons than
corals<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:09.990> aquacultured

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.850 

what<00:01:16.240> I'm<00:01:16.360> showing<00:01:16.600> here<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.410> technique

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
what I'm showing here is the technique

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.950 
what I'm showing here is the technique
that<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.130> call<00:01:18.160> undercutting<00:01:18.850> what<00:01:19.840> I'm

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
that I call undercutting what I'm

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440 
that I call undercutting what I'm
basically<00:01:20.320> trying<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.770> do<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.370> cut<00:01:21.670> away<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
basically trying to do is cut away the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.570 
basically trying to do is cut away the
bottom<00:01:22.840> portion<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.320> skeleton<00:01:23.890> now<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
bottom portion of the skeleton now the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.550 
bottom portion of the skeleton now the
reason<00:01:24.940> for<00:01:25.120> this<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:25.480> because<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.230> lot<00:01:26.320> of

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
reason for this is because a lot of

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.930 
reason for this is because a lot of
times<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:27.100> bottom<00:01:27.460> portion<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
times that bottom portion of the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.820 
times that bottom portion of the
skeleton<00:01:28.420> has<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.900> lot<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.260> dead<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.740> decaying

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
skeleton has a lot of dead and decaying

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.220 
skeleton has a lot of dead and decaying
matter<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.720> don't<00:01:31.780> want<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.110> to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
matter in it and I don't want that to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.200 
matter in it and I don't want that to
adversely<00:01:32.650> affect<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.160> new<00:01:33.310> cuttings<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
adversely affect the new cuttings the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.760 
adversely affect the new cuttings the
second<00:01:37.630> perk<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.320> actually<00:01:38.470> gives

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
second perk is that it actually gives

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.260 
second perk is that it actually gives
you<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.920> nice<00:01:39.070> flat<00:01:39.430> surface<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:39.970> you<00:01:40.240> can

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
you a nice flat surface that you can

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:52.130 
you a nice flat surface that you can
later<00:01:40.570> glue<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.470> fry<00:01:41.680> plugs

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.570 

now<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.439> pieces<00:01:53.680> are<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.040> cut<00:01:54.280> it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
now that the pieces are all cut it's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.880 
now that the pieces are all cut it's
time<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> glue<00:01:55.119> them<00:01:55.299> down<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.630> substrate

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.500 

a<00:02:02.130> question<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.490> lot<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.940> how<00:02:04.210> long

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
a question that I get a lot is how long

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.600 
a question that I get a lot is how long
does<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.810> take<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.320> coral<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.800> dry<00:02:06.010> once<00:02:06.370> it's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
does it take the coral to dry once it's

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.029 
does it take the coral to dry once it's
mounted<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.570> answer<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.709> give<00:02:08.920> is

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
mounted and the answer that I give is

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.880 
mounted and the answer that I give is
not<00:02:09.069> long<00:02:09.759> at<00:02:10.090> all<00:02:10.380> basically<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> only<00:02:11.590> takes

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
not long at all basically it only takes

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.300 
not long at all basically it only takes
a<00:02:12.010> few<00:02:12.130> seconds<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.990> actually<00:02:14.310> cyanoacrylate

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
a few seconds and actually cyanoacrylate
