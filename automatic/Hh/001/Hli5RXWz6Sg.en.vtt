00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.980

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.289

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.980
 capcom more precisely from the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.570
 Developers brace studios the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.699
 unfortunately have been closed 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.420
 yourself with the bluetooth or a name 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.699
 have made 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.439
 okami strikes in the same spot as 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.809
 However, zelda does not play here 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.480
 toy scars but a wolf's 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.829
 blessed with divine powers is yours 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.840
 task it is a multi-headed 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.989
 tremendously destroy that japan 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.520
 Terrified as long as this monster on 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.590
 life is cooling the land is getting more and more 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.989
 everything withered and demon pull through 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.940
 the area and direct comparison to 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.649
 nintendo's action adventure is here 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.780
 No countless tools that you 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.090
 needed to solve the puzzle but 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.820
 just paint one instrument 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.960
 In the course of the adventure you learn this 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 in different ways 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 to use 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.450
 At the touch of a button, you switch to the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 sign mode then it will be up to you 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.420
 your in the right place in the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.320
 landscape the right gods saying 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.850
 brings to paper 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.030
 the operational areas are pretty 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.950
 varied you can trees again 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 help blossom yesterday the objects 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 blast away at certain flowers 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.680
 along pull up small platforms 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 create water and much more 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.700
 that's how it basically went after 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.380
 following principle you enter a village 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.940
 or a city in the first time 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.410
 some dwellers must help 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.420
 the brush is also here yours 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.250
 main tool he parries to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.869
 for example, water mills or rescues 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.850
 spilled children from a cave 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.420
 then it is about the cleansing of the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.420
 landscape 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.470
 in every area of â€‹â€‹japan arrives 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.280
 divine tree he lives again 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.050
 breathe 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.209
 After that, the enemies slowly draw 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.870
 back again, however, is located 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.610
 this tree always at the end of a dungeon 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.560
 here is a varied 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 mixture of skill and self 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.129
 deposits on the program with you 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.440
 only your nimble fingers something 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.480
 brainwash and, of course, the brush 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.580
 can help here it is then to 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.799
 ask how do I get there somehow 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.849
 How can I activate an item? 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.849
 and so on 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.709
 Of course, okami also works hard 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.900
 fought while you're happy through the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.180
 territory draws the opponent only as a small 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.650
 Icon above the screen was touched 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 this symbol will be in a separate 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 Purchase screen appears here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.650
 you also with whom he has to do it 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.379
 and attacks the fantasy beings with the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.609
 square button on 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.859
 like every case he needs one 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.020
 all but one thing is constant 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.090
 together 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.010
 your opponents stay after their own beat 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.460
 for a short time operates on the ground 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.680
 lie 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.960
 Here you turn again in the sign 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.240
 modus packed brush from a designated 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.740
 straight line 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.420
 this causes a clean cut 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.960
 and draw twice as much energy 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.960
 from 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.299
 every brushstroke consumes of course 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.069
 color is the sometime you have to go 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.379
 wait a bit and continue to paint 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.720
 can or but it ensures that in 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.760
 The father for me says so 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.620
 you two choices either you 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.390
 dying trees find me again 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.120
 breathe life or go on forage 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.159
 fork can eat different 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.360
 In every village, you buy addiction to the animal 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.370
 then check out with them 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.750
 friends 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.730
 every happy little animal donates you 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.109
 divine points you then against 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.120
 higher energy or more 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.310
 Inkfish exchanges in regular 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.870
 distances you come across mini events 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.579
 Last time we have your teeth 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.409
 shown in us a wooden trunk on 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.810
 had to stop a torrential river 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.419
 This time, the funny is like grave 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.919
 a water point feels it applies here 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.750
 to come down as fast as possible 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.199
 without your companion to the States 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.270
 booked 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.030
 otherwise there is a tough time 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.830
 deduction these mini-games are all great 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.780
 nice and above all varied 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.449
 failed and make a nice 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.919
 distraction to the main adventure at it and 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.570
 that can not only be due to the 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.570
 let see dreamlike optics 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.100
 Everything is beautifully designed 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.540
 Become some on your journey 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.280
 fairy tale places I have theirs 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.730
 whimsical residents know and love 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.890
 learn 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.700
 For example, we would have a hotel that 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.380
 is completely run by sparrows the 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.490
 entire world is just so loving 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.410
 that one feels like in a good one 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.840
 wants to lose history in it 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.430
 also at the playability of the riddle and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.090
 There is really nothing to do with leveldesign 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.130
 shake 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.500
 the playing time is also fully in 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.680
 well-trained gamblers are just under 30 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.690
 busy hours is the only drawback 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.670
 the missing speech output by 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.800
 sound murmur were replaced 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.780
 that's a bit annoying because of that 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.780
 play has failed to dialoglastig 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.600
 and apart from that we can 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.430
 but every ps2 owner and action 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.010
 adventure friend only guess this 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.420
 pearl to stand in the house 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.980
 The divine wolf is simply the one 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.180
 hammer 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.610
 Here again my thanks to the clubbers 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.080
 studios the game really 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.850
 worthy farewell gift to the 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.610
 zoo community on their legs 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.930
 By the way , you have her right now 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.970
 English version seen 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.970
 the German version translated to flat
