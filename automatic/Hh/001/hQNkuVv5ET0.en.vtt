a<00:01:08.189> week<00:01:08.400> ago<00:01:08.670> today<00:01:08.880> went<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.299> record<00:01:09.510> as

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
a week ago today went on record as

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
a week ago today went on record as
saying<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.860> trend<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.460> correction

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
saying I think the trend the correction

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730 
saying I think the trend the correction
that<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:12.930> reversed<00:01:13.320> itself

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that was going on has reversed itself

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
that was going on has reversed itself
and<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.820> an<00:01:14.939> upward

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and we're now going in an upward

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
and we're now going in an upward
direction<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.990> fact<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.799> happened

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
direction in fact that has happened

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
direction in fact that has happened
since<00:01:17.520> last<00:01:17.670> Wednesday<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
since last Wednesday with you know a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
since last Wednesday with you know a
couple<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> hiccups<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.890> nothing<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> any

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
couple of hiccups but nothing of any

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
couple of hiccups but nothing of any
consequence<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
consequence what do you think has the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
consequence what do you think has the
trend<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.430> mind<00:01:23.640> reverse<00:01:24.030> itself<00:01:24.360> grand

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
trend in your mind reverse itself grand

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
trend in your mind reverse itself grand
well<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> likelihood<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
well I think I think the likelihood is

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.760 
well I think I think the likelihood is
that<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.670> has<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> mean<00:01:27.240> obviously<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:28.320> fall<00:01:28.560> go

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that it has I mean obviously you fall go

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
that it has I mean obviously you fall go
for<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> long<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> know

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
for a long time like I have and you know

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690 
for a long time like I have and you know
you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.810> never<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.170> certain<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:32.579> not

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you can never be certain that we're not

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.830 
you can never be certain that we're not
going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.090> any<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.360> corrections

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
going to see any more corrections

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to see any more corrections
because<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
because it's just that kind of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
settled down very quickly it formed a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.480 
settled down very quickly it formed a
nice<00:01:49.049> base<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.680> started<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> move<00:01:50.159> higher

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

another got you know problems in the US
we've<00:02:02.430> got<00:02:02.549> problems<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.969> China<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.509> know

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
we've got problems in China you know

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
we've got problems in China you know
there<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:03.869> shortage<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> potential

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
there are no shortage of potential

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.449 
there are no shortage of potential
catalysts<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.990> even<00:02:07.110> rock<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> gold<00:02:08.039> higher

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
catalysts not even rock it gold higher

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.969 
catalysts not even rock it gold higher
but<00:02:08.910> certainly<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> put<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> decent

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
but certainly it's going to put a decent

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.979 
but certainly it's going to put a decent
bit<00:02:11.129> under<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.610> price<00:02:11.910> oh<00:02:11.940> yeah<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
bit under the price oh yeah I think the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.400 
bit under the price oh yeah I think the
chance

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
chance

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.950 
chance
a<00:02:13.440> more<00:02:14.400> than<00:02:14.550> likely<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.600> we've

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
a more than likely that you know we've

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.390 
a more than likely that you know we've
seen<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> bottom<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.680> we're<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> move

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
seen the bottom and we're going to move

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520 
seen the bottom and we're going to move
