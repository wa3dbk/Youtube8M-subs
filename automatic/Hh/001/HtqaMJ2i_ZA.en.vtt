00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
truly believe that then why do you think

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
truly believe that then why do you think
all<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.449> being<00:00:30.810> played<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.289> now

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
all this is being played out right now

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319 
all this is being played out right now
especially<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.790> months<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.300> all

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
especially the last two months with all

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.970 
especially the last two months with all
the<00:00:33.660> teams<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.050> seems<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> last<00:00:34.649> two

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the teams it seems like the last two

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160 
the teams it seems like the last two
years<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.030> him<00:00:36.570> leaving<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> door

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
years as well and him leaving the door

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340 
years as well and him leaving the door
wide<00:00:37.200> open<00:00:38.239> well<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.450> he<00:00:39.809> wanted<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> keep

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
wide open well I think he wanted to keep

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
wide open well I think he wanted to keep
the<00:00:40.500> pressure<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> Cavaliers<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.480> want

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the pressure on the Cavaliers and I want

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
the pressure on the Cavaliers and I want
to<00:00:42.750> say<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.500> Mike<00:00:43.710> Brown<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.280> Dan<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to say I think that Mike Brown and Dan a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
to say I think that Mike Brown and Dan a
series<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.559> screwed<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
series I think they got screwed by the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.670 
series I think they got screwed by the
Cavaliers<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.480> did<00:00:48.719> everything<00:00:49.170> possible

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
Cavaliers they did everything possible

Cavaliers they did everything possible
to<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.430> them<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.760> help

I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.210> if<00:01:24.210> LeBron<00:01:24.450> James<00:01:25.080> who<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I think if LeBron James who I think is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740 
I think if LeBron James who I think is
the<00:01:26.070> best<00:01:26.310> player<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> NBA<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.360> he's<00:01:27.540> gonna

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the best player in the NBA if he's gonna

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.440 
the best player in the NBA if he's gonna
go<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> legend<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
go down as a legend I think he has to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.899 
go down as a legend I think he has to
win<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> championship<00:01:31.650> by<00:01:32.100> itself

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
win the championship by itself

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
win the championship by itself
I<00:01:33.030> mean<00:01:33.420> clearly<00:01:33.659> he's<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.990> need<00:01:34.170> better

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I mean clearly he's gonna need better

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.270 
I mean clearly he's gonna need better
players<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> piggy<00:01:36.360> bank<00:01:36.619> piggy<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
players but the piggy bank piggy back on

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
players but the piggy bank piggy back on
the<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> Wigan<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.180> he<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> Miami

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the way and Wigan if he goes to Miami

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.740 
the way and Wigan if he goes to Miami
it's<00:01:40.530> clearly<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> Wayne's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it's clearly going to be the Wayne's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
it's clearly going to be the Wayne's
team<00:01:43.200> he's<00:01:43.500> already<00:01:43.829> won<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> championship

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
team he's already won a championship

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
team he's already won a championship
I<00:01:45.149> got<00:01:45.630> great<00:01:45.899> respect<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> Chris<00:01:46.770> Bosh<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
I got great respect for Chris Bosh but

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
I got great respect for Chris Bosh but
if<00:01:47.820> LeBron<00:01:48.240> James<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
if LeBron James could think about this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
if LeBron James could think about this
and<00:01:49.829> I'll<00:01:49.890> use<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> analogy<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:51.420> finally

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and I'll use this analogy we finally

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710 
and I'll use this analogy we finally
just<00:01:51.960> start<00:01:52.619> giving<00:01:53.130> Kobe<00:01:53.490> Bryant<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.420> do

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
just start giving Kobe Bryant is just do

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.800 
just start giving Kobe Bryant is just do
when<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:55.710> won<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.640> first<00:01:56.939> championship

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
when he won the first championship

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.980 
when he won the first championship
without<00:01:58.110> Shaq<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> again<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> second<00:02:00.869> one

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
without Shaq and again on the second one

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.200 
without Shaq and again on the second one
and<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.130> something<00:02:02.700> different<00:02:02.729> about

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and it's just something different about

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.959 
and it's just something different about
that<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.659> he<00:02:03.810> goes<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.350> Miami<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.829> wins<00:02:05.100> with

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that if he goes to Miami and wins with

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.330 
that if he goes to Miami and wins with
Dwyane<00:02:06.329> Wade<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.899> won't<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.649> same<00:02:07.920> as

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
Dwyane Wade it won't be the same as

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.630 
Dwyane Wade it won't be the same as
winning<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.750> Shaq<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.289> Kobe<00:02:10.349> Kobe<00:02:11.220> didn't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
winning like Shaq and Kobe Kobe didn't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.880 
winning like Shaq and Kobe Kobe didn't
get<00:02:11.790> his<00:02:11.940> respect<00:02:12.480> until<00:02:13.410> he

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
get his respect until he

the championship he can team up with
Dwyane<00:03:06.750> Wade<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.860> gonna<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
Dwyane Wade and think it's gonna be the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.420 
Dwyane Wade and think it's gonna be the
same<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:09.330> Emily<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.080> Cavaliers<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:11.310> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
same as Emily and the Cavaliers to the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.100 
same as Emily and the Cavaliers to the
championship<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.269> will<00:03:12.450> not<00:03:12.660> be<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
championship because it will not be the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.140 
championship because it will not be the
same<00:03:13.160> Charles<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.250> tried<00:03:14.550> their<00:03:14.700> best<00:03:14.760> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
same Charles they tried their best in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.729 
same Charles they tried their best in
Cleveland<00:03:15.480> especially<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.140> year<00:03:16.320> what<00:03:16.470> has

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
Cleveland especially this year what has

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.069 
Cleveland especially this year what has
to<00:03:16.950> happen<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.370> he<00:03:17.459> decides<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.150> stay<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
to happen if he decides to stay with the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.069 
to happen if he decides to stay with the
Cavaliers<00:03:19.560> what<00:03:19.769> has<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.220> change<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:21.079> well

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
Cavaliers what has to change there well

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.960 
Cavaliers what has to change there well
I<00:03:22.110> think<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.650> best<00:03:22.860> deal<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.310> probably<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.820> do

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
I think the best deal is probably to do

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
I think the best deal is probably to do
a<00:03:24.000> silent<00:03:24.390> read<00:03:24.930> whether<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
a silent read whether it's with the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.000 
a silent read whether it's with the
Phoenix<00:03:26.340> Suns<00:03:26.610> for<00:03:27.510> Amar'e<00:03:27.840> Stoudemire<00:03:28.230> or

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
Phoenix Suns for Amar'e Stoudemire or

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.000 
Phoenix Suns for Amar'e Stoudemire or
with<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> Toronto<00:03:30.030> Raptors<00:03:30.570> or<00:03:31.049> Chris<00:03:31.380> Bosh<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
with the Toronto Raptors or Chris Bosh I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.370 
with the Toronto Raptors or Chris Bosh I
mean<00:03:32.220> clearly<00:03:32.489> he<00:03:32.700> needs<00:03:32.970> some<00:03:33.180> help<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:34.140> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
mean clearly he needs some help but I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.979 
mean clearly he needs some help but I
don't<00:03:34.739> think<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.310> designs<00:03:36.209> are<00:03:36.480> gonna<00:03:36.690> give<00:03:36.959> a

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
problem with his eyes and I've had a

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.120 
problem with his eyes and I've had a
doctor<00:04:48.000> tell<00:04:48.240> me<00:04:48.270> he's<00:04:48.990> one<00:04:49.290> poking<00:04:49.830> his<00:04:49.979> eye

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
doctor tell me he's one poking his eye

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.730 
doctor tell me he's one poking his eye
away<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:50.880> maybe<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.389> in<00:04:51.510> its<00:04:51.690> career<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.350> the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
away but maybe it in its career and the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.360 
away but maybe it in its career and the
third<00:04:53.010> reason<00:04:53.340> is<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.960> he's<00:04:55.440> not<00:04:55.770> ever<00:04:56.070> been

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
third reason is it he's not ever been

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.790 
third reason is it he's not ever been
the<00:04:56.490> best<00:04:56.760> player<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.180> his<00:04:57.360> team<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.470> would

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
the best player on his team so I would

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.920 
the best player on his team so I would
not<00:04:58.949> give<00:04:59.310> him<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.520> maximum<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.570> I<00:05:00.660> think

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
not give him the maximum and I think

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.659 
not give him the maximum and I think
those<00:05:01.110> are<00:05:01.139> three<00:05:01.470> legitimate<00:05:02.250> reasons

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
those are three legitimate reasons

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.640 
those are three legitimate reasons
that's<00:05:02.789> nothing<00:05:03.120> against<00:05:03.360> him<00:05:03.600> it's<00:05:04.350> terrific

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
that's nothing against him it's terrific

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.740 
that's nothing against him it's terrific
player<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:06.060> business<00:05:06.300> there's

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
player but this is business there's

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
player but this is business there's
nothing<00:05:07.110> personal
