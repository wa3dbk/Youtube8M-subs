00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.510
 many battles have been fought 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.510
 over the years 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.779
 but none has been like this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.959
 we are destined to destroy ourselves between 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.610
 we can change our 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:22.070
 essence and join 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.070
 it is the truly unalterable future 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.470
 mutants we are on the verge of 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.470
 extinction 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.050
 you will have to go to the past you have to finish 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.050
 this war before it starts 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.950
 use your power to meet the sixth 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.949
 We will have to work together in a 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.640
 time we could not be more 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640
 separated 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.370
 and what matters most to me 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.370
 maybe you did not fight hard enough 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.490
 we have a new enemy the mutants 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 we need a new weapon I know what 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 I have to do is we or them 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.100
 so many years lost fighting between 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 us chau 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.460
 of seen die many people 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 friends 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.250
 a second chance 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.990
 and guide directs us 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 and I do not want 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.030
 a future 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.030
 we should protect it 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.900
 you are afraid I remember
