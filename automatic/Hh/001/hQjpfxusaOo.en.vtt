again pulling off back to five and from
here<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.379> inside<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
on the eighth fret B string which leads

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
on the eighth fret B string which leads
back<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.359> down<00:00:54.600> stroke<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> fifth<00:00:55.379> fret

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
back to a down stroke on the fifth fret

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
back to a down stroke on the fifth fret
high<00:00:55.800> E<00:00:55.829> string<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> liquid<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.850> repeat

the<00:01:02.160> eighth<00:01:02.309> fret<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
the eighth fret now this is one of a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.390 
the eighth fret now this is one of a
couple<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.200> ways<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.560> execute<00:01:10.800> this<00:01:11.160> type<00:01:11.370> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
couple of ways to execute this type of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
couple of ways to execute this type of
lick<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.450> common<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
lick and it's also very common to see a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.570 
lick and it's also very common to see a
play<00:01:13.320> following<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> momentum<00:01:14.370> of<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
play following the momentum of the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.430 
play following the momentum of the
alternate<00:01:15.060> picking<00:01:15.270> outside<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.200> string

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
alternate picking outside the string

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:25.600 
alternate picking outside the string
approach<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:17.520> would<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.180> down<00:01:18.990> down

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.450 

to<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> peak<00:01:26.909> hooking<00:01:27.270> round<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> string<00:01:28.460> as

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
to the peak hooking round the string as

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.999 
to the peak hooking round the string as
opposed<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> our<00:01:30.119> other<00:01:30.240> approach

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.039 

which<00:01:34.579> keeps<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.969> pic<00:01:35.149> inside<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.750> stream

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
which keeps the pic inside the stream

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.499 
which keeps the pic inside the stream
now<00:01:37.009> both<00:01:37.219> techniques<00:01:37.610> work<00:01:37.880> well<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.390> you

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
now both techniques work well and you

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.029 
now both techniques work well and you
should<00:01:38.539> experiment<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.320> see<00:01:39.469> what<00:01:39.590> feels<00:01:39.860> more

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
should experiment to see what feels more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.100 
should experiment to see what feels more
natural<00:01:40.430> for<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.450> inside<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.899> string

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
natural for you the inside the string

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.660 
natural for you the inside the string
approach<00:01:42.409> may<00:01:42.619> be<00:01:42.679> more<00:01:42.950> natural<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.429> players

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
approach may be more natural to players

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.069 
approach may be more natural to players
that<00:01:43.909> use<00:01:44.030> economy<00:01:44.479> picking<00:01:44.719> as<00:01:44.899> their

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
that use economy picking as their

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.870 
that use economy picking as their
default<00:01:45.259> technique<00:01:45.890> whereas<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.490> outside

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
default technique whereas the outside

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.310 
default technique whereas the outside
version<00:01:47.299> may<00:01:47.450> feel<00:01:47.659> more<00:01:47.689> natural<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
version may feel more natural to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.319 
version may feel more natural to
alternate<00:01:48.860> Pickers<00:01:49.189> there's<00:01:49.939> very<00:01:50.149> little

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
alternate Pickers there's very little

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.029 
alternate Pickers there's very little
difference<00:01:50.569> in<00:01:50.869> potential<00:01:51.350> speed<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:51.950> I'd

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
difference in potential speed but I'd

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.529 
difference in potential speed but I'd
say<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.340> inside<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.789> string<00:01:53.000> version<00:01:53.270> is

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
say the inside the string version is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.899 
say the inside the string version is
smoother<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:53.960> more<00:01:54.170> legato<00:01:54.759> whereas<00:01:55.759> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
smoother and more legato whereas the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.399 
smoother and more legato whereas the
alternate<00:01:56.360> picking<00:01:56.539> version<00:01:56.990> may<00:01:57.140> let<00:01:57.319> you

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
alternate picking version may let you

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.139 
alternate picking version may let you
dig<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.799> little<00:01:57.829> bit<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.310> or<00:01:58.549> use<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.819> palm

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
dig in a little bit more or use a palm

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.539 
dig in a little bit more or use a palm
mute<00:01:59.179> sound<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.799> also<00:02:00.979> depends<00:02:01.490> on

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
mute sound I think it also depends on

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.100 
mute sound I think it also depends on
and<00:02:01.729> how<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.880> works<00:02:02.240> within<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> context<00:02:03.020> of

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
and how it works within the context of

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.380 
and how it works within the context of
the<00:02:03.229> other<00:02:03.350> areas<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.770> your<00:02:03.890> playing<00:02:04.189> style<00:02:04.429> so

the other areas of your playing style so
