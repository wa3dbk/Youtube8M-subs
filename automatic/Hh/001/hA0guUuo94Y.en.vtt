you experience this is a fairly standard
RPG<00:00:53.850> mechanic<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.570> by<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> time<00:00:54.809> you're

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
RPG mechanic and by the time you're

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
RPG mechanic and by the time you're
capped<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.219> ogre<00:00:56.430> gaining<00:00:56.789> experience

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
capped out on an ogre gaining experience

capped out on an ogre gaining experience
you<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> killed<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> stuff<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you have killed some of the stuff is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
you have killed some of the stuff is
stuff<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> world<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.109> done

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
stuff in the world you're probably done

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.479 
stuff in the world you're probably done
with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> game<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.129> you've<00:01:02.250> killed

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
with the game because you've killed

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
with the game because you've killed
almost<00:01:02.760> everything<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> our

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
almost everything so it's kind of our

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
almost everything so it's kind of our
approach<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.100> soft<00:01:05.369> cap<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
approach it's more of a soft cap and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
approach it's more of a soft cap and
there<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> point<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> stop

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
there will be a point at which you stop

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
there will be a point at which you stop
leveling<00:01:07.530> somewhere<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.540> honest

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
leveling somewhere which to be honest

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.770 
leveling somewhere which to be honest
makes<00:01:10.200> perfect<00:01:10.619> sense<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:12.299> seems<00:01:12.510> more

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
makes perfect sense this seems more

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
makes perfect sense this seems more
natural<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.439> free-flowing<00:01:14.159> than<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.970> hey

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
natural more free-flowing than just hey

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.990 
natural more free-flowing than just hey
you've<00:01:15.299> reached<00:01:15.330> level<00:01:15.810> 90<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> now

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
you've reached level 90 that's it now

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
you've reached level 90 that's it now
rather<00:01:18.000> than<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.420> being<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.659> case<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
rather than just being in case of the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
rather than just being in case of the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
enemies of becoming far too low level

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
enemies of becoming far too low level
for<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> you're<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.350> even<00:01:22.530> gaining<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
for you and you're not even gaining a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
for you and you're not even gaining a
single<00:01:23.580> experience<00:01:24.150> point<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:24.900> killing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
single experience point from killing

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
single experience point from killing
them<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> seems<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.540> fluid<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.630> organic

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
them that seems more fluid and organic

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
them that seems more fluid and organic
and<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.040> slightly<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.479> want

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and just more slightly more I don't want

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.060 
and just more slightly more I don't want
to<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> word<00:01:30.960> realistic<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> seems

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to use the word realistic but it seems

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
to use the word realistic but it seems
less<00:01:32.340> gamey<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.299> level<00:01:33.600> 90<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.259> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
less gamey then your level 90 that's it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
less gamey then your level 90 that's it
that's<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.640> seems<00:01:36.329> more<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's your not it seems more of a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
that's your not it seems more of a
natural<00:01:37.040> growth<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> progression<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.850> your

natural growth and progression of your

natural growth and progression of your
character<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.689> you're<00:01:39.810> getting<00:01:40.020> too

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
character and then you're getting too

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.590 
character and then you're getting too
strong<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.549> monsters<00:01:42.119> sort<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> went

strong for these monsters sort of went
you<00:01:42.720> literally<00:01:43.020> can't<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.530> any<00:01:43.649> stronger<00:01:43.979> by

you literally can't get any stronger by

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.679 
you literally can't get any stronger by
difficulty<00:01:44.700> limb<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.509> defeat

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
difficulty limb because you can defeat

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.960 
difficulty limb because you can defeat
them<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.200> swing<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> whatever<00:01:47.009> which

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
them with one swing or whatever which

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
them with one swing or whatever which
makes<00:01:48.240> perfect<00:01:48.659> sense<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> course<00:01:49.259> every<00:01:49.530> RPG

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
makes perfect sense of course every RPG

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.190 
makes perfect sense of course every RPG
has<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:51.030> form<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> level<00:01:51.750> cap<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
has to have some form of level cap but I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
has to have some form of level cap but I
like<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> idea<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.189> soft<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> level<00:01:54.000> cap

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
like the idea of a soft and level cap

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
like the idea of a soft and level cap
just<00:01:54.990> makes<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> world<00:01:55.500> feel<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.009> less<00:01:56.219> gave

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
just makes the world feel not less gave

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
just makes the world feel not less gave
me<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:58.350> touch<00:01:58.890> with

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
me a little bit more in touch with

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.789 
me a little bit more in touch with
reality<00:01:59.299> of<00:02:00.299> course<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.049> traditional<00:02:01.619> way<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
reality of course a traditional way is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.490 
reality of course a traditional way is
you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.700> once<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.570> you've<00:02:04.079> maxed<00:02:04.409> out

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you know once you get you've maxed out

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.899 
you know once you get you've maxed out
with<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.680> talents<00:02:05.040> maxed<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.520> everything

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
with your talents maxed out everything

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.029 
with your talents maxed out everything
that's<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.990> level<00:02:07.320> camp<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that's it that's your level camp and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.139 
that's it that's your level camp and
they'll<00:02:08.429> probably<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.700> something<00:02:08.970> like

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
they'll probably have something like

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.940 
they'll probably have something like
that<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.360> well<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.690> there's<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.200> only<00:02:10.410> certain

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that as well as there's an only certain

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.380 
that as well as there's an only certain
amount<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.160> experience<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.879> pour<00:02:12.150> into

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
amount of experience you can pour into

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
amount of experience you can pour into
your<00:02:12.660> skills<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.349> whatnot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
your skills and whatnot

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
your skills and whatnot
but<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:15.090> won't<00:02:15.420> necessarily<00:02:15.540> stop<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.290> from

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
but that won't necessarily stop you from

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.710 
but that won't necessarily stop you from
gaining<00:02:16.590> experience<00:02:17.100> as<00:02:17.490> long<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.120> you're

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
gaining experience as long as you're

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.930 
gaining experience as long as you're
still<00:02:19.050> not<00:02:19.500> stupidly<00:02:20.130> high<00:02:20.400> level<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
still not stupidly high level for the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.970 
still not stupidly high level for the
monsters<00:02:21.390> at<00:02:21.930> which<00:02:22.170> point<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.530> stop<00:02:22.740> giving

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
monsters at which point they stop giving

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.410 
monsters at which point they stop giving
you<00:02:23.070> experience<00:02:23.610> well<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:23.940> remains<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.330> be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
you experience well that remains to be

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.060 
you experience well that remains to be
seen<00:02:24.780> you'll<00:02:25.110> probably<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.650> several

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
seen you'll probably have to be several

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.710 
seen you'll probably have to be several
levels<00:02:26.370> higher<00:02:26.790> than<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.150> enemies<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
levels higher than the enemies for that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.690 
levels higher than the enemies for that
to<00:02:27.870> happen<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.560> probably<00:02:28.950> won't<00:02:29.220> happen<00:02:29.430> when

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
to happen it probably won't happen when

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.740 
to happen it probably won't happen when
you're<00:02:29.820> only<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.300> levels<00:02:30.600> higher

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you're only like two levels higher

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
you're only like two levels higher
that'll<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.050> rather<00:02:31.260> silly<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.100> say<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> 20

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that'll be rather silly but say the 20

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.860 
that'll be rather silly but say the 20
levels<00:02:32.850> higher<00:02:33.210> or<00:02:33.450> something<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
levels higher or something like that

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.450 
levels higher or something like that
yeah<00:02:34.350> they'll<00:02:34.590> probably<00:02:34.800> stop<00:02:35.100> giving<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
yeah they'll probably stop giving you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.860 
yeah they'll probably stop giving you
experience<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.240> kind<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.510> level<00:02:36.660> of

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
experience is that kind of level of

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
experience is that kind of level of
course<00:02:37.350> I'm<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.680> speculating<00:02:37.890> now

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
course I'm just speculating now

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.190 
course I'm just speculating now
unfortunately<00:02:38.760> might<00:02:39.270> not<00:02:39.630> go<00:02:39.780> into<00:02:39.900> great

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
unfortunately might not go into great

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.170 
unfortunately might not go into great
detail<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.890> surely<00:02:41.670> we'll<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.000> more

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
detail but surely we'll have more

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
detail but surely we'll have more
information<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.110> coming<00:02:43.410> days<00:02:43.560> regarding

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
information in the coming days regarding

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.010 
information in the coming days regarding

dragon age inquisition in general and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020 
dragon age inquisition in general and
hopefully<00:02:46.620> we'll<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.100> nice<00:02:47.640> neat

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
hopefully we'll get a nice neat

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.970 
hopefully we'll get a nice neat

breakdown or ever how everything works
or<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.910> we<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:51.390> find<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.750> for
