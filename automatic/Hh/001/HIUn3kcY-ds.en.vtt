00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.510
 Parliament I assure you that this is a 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.240
 therapy because you're busy you're not 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:12.590
 thinking of nothing and it's very easy with 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.540
 little things with good elements only 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.539
 with three little things half of a necklace this 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.419
 guy eyes and the mayor a little bit of the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.720
 color that I like color life me 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.720
 like 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.800
 some golden rings of hours that 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.870
 touch more as mayor denied what can you 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.449
 use with a destroyer you can use it 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.730
 that a band what I like the most is that 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.329
 the necklace is elongated which is a way 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:46.670
 very nice to use your image with a 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.350
 with an ink according how you want 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.800
 exactly half what we're going to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.769
 need a super easy an absolute 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.480
 clear remember to combine the colors that 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.699
 put contrast in this case I used 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.760
 a gray and we're going to use it with some 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.760
 pompoms I really like 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.470
 dale dale I explain good guys 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.430
 as I had told you some pompoms in the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.290
 color of your taste 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.420
 a cord either a point no more low 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.360
 a totally incessant tone for 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 contrast we have a joanes cabin and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.950
 a golden chain you can choose the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.500
 everything they like is golden 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.830
 because it gave me more warmth and we have 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.560
 these aids that come in a few pouches 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.570
 You can get it at any store and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.820
 is what will bind the entire necklace 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 together let's start we need 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.280
 first long money what we would do 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.380
 I 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.570
 this one that we have here I had a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.810
 long because you can put it more 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.210
 short little color or long type that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.680
 days later up to the chest we're going to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.619
 start using the pom poms the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.170
 They took out in the rings I show you 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.720
 here with some with different what we are going 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.880
 to do is that we are going to open them as 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.479
 we open them if you show me here the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.239
 tricks 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.720
 we can open it with a clamp grasping 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.239
 and with the other 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.209
 Now we simply turn it around with 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.640
 that same clip of the had the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.590
 they'll find out about the pom-poms and at home 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.739
 12 years ago they are going to go through the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.410
 chain in the sierra extremely easy and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.599
 so they add one by one until 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.510
 help at the end of the necklace and then 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.060
 when they have all excellent put 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.510
 step is to pass it and well I can tell you 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.730
 something quickie when they cut their 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 structure your cord remember to put it 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.739
 together with the transparent silva because 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.840
 because if they are not going to be 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.030
 will last nothing the necklace with two 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.690
 I already told you yes to look 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 they simply link one by one 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.270
 those habits that I put them in the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.430
 zone 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:08.220
 and they are having fun fun 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.470
 the final product will create them like this 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 you can put it long short here what 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.660
 important is to renew your wardrobe and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.270
 asked if everything brings them a 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.460
 no happiness touch and he puts a 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.560
 smile is deciding in what way 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.100
 a little bit wrong with this hanging just to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.100
 subtle better
