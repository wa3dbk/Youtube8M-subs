we<00:00:00.930> are<00:00:01.079> working<00:00:01.319> on<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.920> tibia<00:00:02.899> the<00:00:03.899> tibia<00:00:04.380> is

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
we are working on the tibia the tibia is

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.140 
we are working on the tibia the tibia is
a<00:00:04.620> large<00:00:05.009> bone<00:00:05.400> with<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.940> flat<00:00:06.980> top<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.309> it

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
a large bone with the flat top and it

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.890 
a large bone with the flat top and it
has<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.630> hook<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.610> bottom<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.599> tibia

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
has a hook on the bottom on the tibia

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.330 
has a hook on the bottom on the tibia
this<00:00:13.259> hook<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> called<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.250> malleolus<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:16.680> hook

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
this hook is called a malleolus the hook

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.540 
this hook is called a malleolus the hook
and<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> point<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.930> remember

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
interior or medial side so then this

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730 
interior or medial side so then this
would<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.039> medial<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.599> call<00:00:27.840> make<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.800 

opposite<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> medial<00:00:40.140> malleolus<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:44.810> the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
opposite the medial malleolus is the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:59.869 
opposite the medial malleolus is the
fibular<00:00:46.680> notch

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.790 

again<00:01:00.879> opposite<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> malleolus<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.469> the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
again opposite the malleolus is the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.740 
again opposite the malleolus is the
fibular<00:01:03.449> notch<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.729> distinguish<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.420> front

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
fibular notch to distinguish the front

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.830 
fibular notch to distinguish the front
we<00:01:11.650> look<00:01:11.890> for<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:13.530> tip<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:15.840> tibial

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:32.010 

again<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.560> tibial<00:01:25.130> tuberosity

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.490 

as<00:01:33.020> seen<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.590> our<00:01:33.860> textbook<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.900> tibial

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
as seen in our textbook the tibial

as seen in our textbook the tibial
tuberosity

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.109 

in<00:01:44.320> my<00:01:44.710> reference<00:01:44.950> book<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.640> tibial

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
in my reference book the tibial

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.039 
in my reference book the tibial
tuberosity<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.740> lets<00:01:48.010> us<00:01:48.190> know<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.549> front

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
tuberosity this lets us know the front

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.359 
tuberosity this lets us know the front
seeing<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.290> this<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> front<00:01:51.100> or

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
seeing that this is the front or

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.330 
seeing that this is the front or
anterior<00:01:52.180> view<00:01:52.479> point<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:53.979> the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
anterior view point and this is the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.320 
anterior view point and this is the
medial<00:01:54.760> side<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.759> would<00:01:57.970> be<00:01:58.150> our

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
medial side then this would be our

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.280 
medial side then this would be our
sternum<00:01:59.080> and<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:01.000> looking<00:02:01.390> at<00:02:01.509> anatomical

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
sternum and we're looking at anatomical

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
sternum and we're looking at anatomical
position<00:02:02.860> since<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> front<00:02:04.600> facing

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
position since this is the front facing

position since this is the front facing
sternum<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.899> is<00:02:08.110> left<00:02:08.789> viewing<00:02:09.789> angle<00:02:10.270> right

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
sternum this is left viewing angle right

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.010 
sternum this is left viewing angle right
viewing<00:02:11.530> angle<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.640> anatomical<00:02:13.569> position

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
viewing angle so anatomical position

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.910 
viewing angle so anatomical position
reverses<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.700> would<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:16.000> my<00:02:16.209> left

reverses that and this would be my left

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
reverses that and this would be my left
tibia<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.550> would<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.850> my<00:02:19.030> right<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.600> mean

left tibia

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.440

because<00:02:29.680> anatomical<00:02:30.430> position<00:02:30.850> reverses

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
because anatomical position reverses

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.080 
because anatomical position reverses
left<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.930> right<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.560> left<00:02:33.090> reversing

left and right this is left reversing
that<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.420> would<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.720> right<00:02:34.989> tibia<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.190> this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
is my right viewing angle reversing that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.309 
is my right viewing angle reversing that
it<00:02:39.130> would<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.400> my<00:02:39.550> left<00:02:40.350> tibia<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.420> of

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
it would be my left tibia on the back of

it would be my left tibia on the back of
the<00:02:44.590> tibia<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:46.180> find<00:02:46.480> instead<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.680> tibial

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the tibia we find instead of the tibial

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:58.830 
the tibia we find instead of the tibial
tuberosity<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.959> find<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:51.360> cont<00:02:53.670> cave<00:02:54.670> surface

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.839 

and<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> articular<00:03:00.819> facet<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
and this is the articular facet for the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.710 
and this is the articular facet for the
fibula<00:03:03.849> again<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.849> fibular<00:03:06.849> knotch

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
fibula again we have the fibular knotch

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.190 
fibula again we have the fibular knotch
the<00:03:10.720> medial<00:03:11.230> malleolus<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:16.200> medial

this<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.030> top<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:34.050> called<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.650> medial

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
this on the top is called the medial

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.380 
this on the top is called the medial
condyle<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.140> called<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.710> I<00:03:38.390> mean

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.350 
condyle and this is called the I mean
this<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.780> called<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.170> medial<00:03:40.620> condyle

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
this is called the medial condyle

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.790 
this is called the medial condyle
because<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:42.570> on<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> same<00:03:42.990> size<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.290> medial

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
because it's on the same size the medial

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.890 
because it's on the same size the medial
malleolus<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:45.180> would<00:03:45.360> be<00:03:45.480> called<00:03:45.720> the

malleolus and this would be called the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.860 
malleolus and this would be called the
lateral<00:03:46.170> condyle

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:03.410

see<00:04:11.360> if<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.570> could<00:04:11.720> determine<00:04:12.650> using<00:04:12.920> freeze

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
see if you could determine using freeze

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:32.160 
see if you could determine using freeze
frames<00:04:13.730> which<00:04:15.549> bone<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.790> is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.470 

again<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:33.650> would<00:04:33.770> look<00:04:33.980> see<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.030> depression

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
again you would look see this depression

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.570 
again you would look see this depression
knowing<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.350> back<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.310> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
knowing this is the back this is the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.780 
knowing this is the back this is the
medial<00:04:37.970> side<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.960> medial<00:04:39.350> malleolus

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
medial side is the medial malleolus

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.960 
medial side is the medial malleolus
medial<00:04:40.790> condyle<00:04:41.410> lateral<00:04:42.410> condyle<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:43.790> then

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
medial condyle lateral condyle so then

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.330 
medial condyle lateral condyle so then
my<00:04:44.150> sternum<00:04:44.480> would<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.740> medial<00:04:46.130> side

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
my sternum would be this is medial side

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.190 
my sternum would be this is medial side
my<00:04:46.640> stern<00:04:46.850> will<00:04:47.030> be<00:04:47.120> here<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.510> is<00:04:47.570> my<00:04:47.720> left

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
my stern will be here this is my left

00:04:48.200 --> 00:05:00.660 
my stern will be here this is my left
tibia<00:04:56.530> medial<00:04:57.530> side<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:59.150> back<00:04:59.360> depression

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
tibia medial side the back depression

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.140 
tibia medial side the back depression
sternum<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:02.030> way<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:04.430> this<00:05:04.640> would<00:05:04.820> be<00:05:04.940> my

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
sternum is this way so this would be my

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.430 
sternum is this way so this would be my
right<00:05:05.690> tibia<00:05:08.920> again<00:05:09.920> in<00:05:10.130> anatomical<00:05:10.550> position

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
right tibia again in anatomical position

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.800 
right tibia again in anatomical position
the<00:05:12.440> left<00:05:12.740> becomes<00:05:12.980> right<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:14.300> this<00:05:14.480> again<00:05:14.750> is

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
the left becomes right so this again is

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:25.390 
the left becomes right so this again is
my<00:05:15.080> right<00:05:15.320> tibia<00:05:20.560> medial<00:05:22.060> epicondyle<00:05:24.400> tip

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:29.799 

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:34.619 

tuberosity<00:05:31.629> this<00:05:32.629> is<00:05:32.869> again<00:05:33.379> is<00:05:33.559> my<00:05:33.769> sternum

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
tuberosity this is again is my sternum

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.079 
tuberosity this is again is my sternum
this<00:05:35.629> is<00:05:35.839> a<00:05:35.869> medial<00:05:36.289> side<00:05:37.089> anatomical

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.089 
this is a medial side anatomical

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.089 
this is a medial side anatomical
position<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.689> right<00:05:38.869> becomes<00:05:39.049> left<00:05:39.379> so<00:05:39.949> this

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
position the right becomes left so this

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.629 
position the right becomes left so this
is<00:05:40.249> left<00:05:40.489> this<00:05:40.759> is<00:05:40.939> right<00:05:41.179> viewing<00:05:41.919> my<00:05:42.919> viewing

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
is left this is right viewing my viewing

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.929 
is left this is right viewing my viewing
position<00:05:44.299> right<00:05:44.569> becomes<00:05:44.929> left<00:05:45.939> anatomical

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
position right becomes left anatomical

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.169 
position right becomes left anatomical
position<00:05:47.389> this<00:05:47.779> means<00:05:48.289> this<00:05:48.469> is<00:05:48.619> my<00:05:48.649> left

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:49.179 
position this means this is my left
