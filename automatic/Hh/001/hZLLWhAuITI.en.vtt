00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
Sun today the third of August 2011 we've

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.220 
Sun today the third of August 2011 we've
had<00:00:05.940> two<00:00:06.150> more<00:00:06.299> m<00:00:06.450> players<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.930> coronal

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
had two more m players in the coronal

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.410 
had two more m players in the coronal
mass<00:00:07.379> ejection<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.849> moderate<00:00:09.090> level<00:00:09.360> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
mass ejection so this moderate level of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.200 
mass ejection so this moderate level of
solar<00:00:09.660> activity<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.200> continuing<00:00:11.120> over<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
solar activity is continuing over the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.339 
solar activity is continuing over the
last<00:00:12.389> few<00:00:12.540> weeks<00:00:12.599> we've<00:00:12.900> talked<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.200> lot<00:00:13.290> about

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
last few weeks we've talked a lot about

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.550 
last few weeks we've talked a lot about
coronal<00:00:13.920> mass<00:00:14.040> ejections<00:00:15.020> so<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> day<00:00:16.230> trivia

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
coronal mass ejections so the day trivia

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.439 
coronal mass ejections so the day trivia
question<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> how<00:00:17.520> long<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.880> known<00:00:18.000> about

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
question is how long have we known about

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.029 
question is how long have we known about
coronal<00:00:18.990> mass<00:00:19.140> ejections<00:00:19.619> always<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.980> they

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
coronal mass ejections always that they

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.920 
coronal mass ejections always that they
were<00:00:20.130> known<00:00:20.310> then<00:00:20.520> coronal<00:00:21.029> transients<00:00:21.600> at

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
were known then coronal transients at

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.130 
were known then coronal transients at
how<00:00:22.289> were<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.590> discovered<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.810> answer<00:00:25.080> will

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
how were they discovered the answer will

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 
how were they discovered the answer will
be<00:00:25.230> given<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.650> end<00:00:26.330> from<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> girls<00:00:27.660> x-ray

be given at the end from the girls x-ray
plot<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> we've<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.859> six<00:00:29.160> see

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
plot we see that we've had six see

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.170 
plot we see that we've had six see
pheasant<00:00:29.880> 11<00:00:30.210> players<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> last<00:00:30.779> 24<00:00:31.320> hours

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
pheasant 11 players in the last 24 hours

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
pheasant 11 players in the last 24 hours
interestingly<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.989> 2m<00:00:34.350> prayers<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.770> from

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
interestingly the 2m prayers are from

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
interestingly the 2m prayers are from
different<00:00:35.070> regions<00:00:35.600> region<00:00:36.600> 1261<00:00:37.200> produced

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
different regions region 1261 produced

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.119 
different regions region 1261 produced
one<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.280> 1263<00:00:38.790> produced<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> other

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
one of them and 1263 produced the other

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.440 
one of them and 1263 produced the other
so<00:00:41.129> these<00:00:41.250> two<00:00:41.460> regions<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.910> showing<00:00:42.210> quite<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so these two regions are showing quite a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
so these two regions are showing quite a
bit<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> activity<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.620> let's<00:00:43.770> take<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.129> at

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
bit of activity so let's take a look at

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.560 
bit of activity so let's take a look at
the<00:00:44.280> regions<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.879> what's<00:00:45.059> been<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.480> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the regions and see what's been going on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.520 
the regions and see what's been going on
there<00:00:46.850> we've<00:00:47.850> lost<00:00:48.000> region<00:00:48.360> 12<00:00:48.570> 65<00:00:49.079> over<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
there we've lost region 12 65 over the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.090 
there we've lost region 12 65 over the
Northwest<00:00:50.160> slim<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.360> region<00:00:51.690> 1264<00:00:52.440> died<00:00:52.829> away

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Northwest slim and region 1264 died away

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
Northwest slim and region 1264 died away
in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> southern<00:00:53.640> hemisphere<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> we're<00:00:55.440> left

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
in the southern hemisphere so we're left

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
in the southern hemisphere so we're left
with<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:56.190> numbered<00:00:56.520> regions<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
with just three numbered regions on the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
with just three numbered regions on the
disc<00:00:57.440> region<00:00:58.440> 1260<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.340> seems<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
disc region 1260 which seems to be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.170 
disc region 1260 which seems to be
decaying<00:01:00.000> somewhat<00:01:01.280> bridget<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.430> 61<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
decaying somewhat bridget all 61 and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
decaying somewhat bridget all 61 and
1263<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.260> I've<00:01:04.379> said<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> main

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
1263 which as I've said it in the main

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.210 
1263 which as I've said it in the main
sources<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> activity<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> new

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sources of activity but we do have a new

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.060 
sources of activity but we do have a new
region<00:01:08.520> coming<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> North<00:01:09.299> East<00:01:09.630> slim

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
region coming over the North East slim

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.609 
region coming over the North East slim
which<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.580> yet<00:01:11.790> been<00:01:11.970> numbered<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> let's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
which is not yet been numbered so let's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.539 
which is not yet been numbered so let's
take<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> look<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> development<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
take a look at the development of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
take a look at the development of
regions<00:01:14.909> 12<00:01:15.150> 61<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.689> 63<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.150> white<00:01:18.150> light

continued spectacular development over
the<00:01:24.990> last<00:01:25.049> few<00:01:25.439> days<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.700> almost

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the last few days and is almost

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
the last few days and is almost
unrecognizable<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.840> day<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> day<00:01:28.670> however

unrecognizable from day to day however
is<00:01:29.970> very<00:01:30.150> difficult<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:30.869> major

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
is very difficult to see any major

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.560 
is very difficult to see any major
changes<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.680> region<00:01:32.009> 1263<00:01:32.549> which<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.420> why<00:01:33.540> i

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
watch it carefully and see if you can

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.120 
watch it carefully and see if you can
see<00:01:37.549> any<00:01:37.700> major<00:01:37.880> changes<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.679> the<00:01:39.679> transition

see any major changes in the transition
region<00:01:40.219> data<00:01:40.579> let's<00:01:40.789> take<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:41.000> look<00:01:41.210> at<00:01:41.329> some

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
region data let's take a look at some

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.080 
region data let's take a look at some
prominences<00:01:42.140> there<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.189> one<00:01:43.399> prominent<00:01:43.789> on

prominences there is one prominent on

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.789 
prominences there is one prominent on
the<00:01:44.390> north<00:01:44.570> west<00:01:44.869> linn<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.380> looked<00:01:45.530> very

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
the north west linn that looked very

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.980 
the north west linn that looked very
likely<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.640> lift<00:01:46.939> off<00:01:47.119> in<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.390> next<00:01:47.479> few<00:01:47.750> days

some posh in a couple of small spots but

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
some posh in a couple of small spots but

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379

answer to the trivia question is that

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.350 
answer to the trivia question is that
coronal<00:04:20.919> mass<00:04:21.040> ejections<00:04:21.609> were<00:04:21.820> discovered

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
coronal mass ejections were discovered

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.200 
coronal mass ejections were discovered
by<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.630> NRL<00:04:23.229> instrument<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:23.979> ozo<00:04:24.850> 7

so<00:04:29.160> that's<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.640> today<00:04:29.880> keep<00:04:30.450> safe<00:04:30.690> bye<00:04:31.290> for

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.560 
so that's it for today keep safe bye for
now
