now<00:00:01.050> what<00:00:01.199> I've<00:00:01.290> done<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.589> taken<00:00:01.770> the

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:02.389 
now what I've done is taken the

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.420 
now what I've done is taken the
fiberglass<00:00:03.560> which<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.279> whole

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
fiberglass which is this is the whole

fiberglass which is this is the whole
sheet<00:00:05.779> -<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.049> little<00:00:07.290> bit<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.500> area<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.069> I've

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
sheet - a little bit of area and I've

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.470 
sheet - a little bit of area and I've
realigned<00:00:09.469> central<00:00:10.469> core<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.150> then<00:00:12.150> put<00:00:12.389> it

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
realigned central core and then put it

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.150 
realigned central core and then put it
back<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.900> pipe<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.559> still<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
back in a pipe and you can still see the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.660 
back in a pipe and you can still see the
edges<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.480> haven't<00:00:15.630> cleaned

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
edges here which I haven't cleaned

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.950 
edges here which I haven't cleaned
what's<00:00:17.670> isn't<00:00:17.880> interesting<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
what's isn't interesting about this is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779 
what's isn't interesting about this is
this<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.320> thing<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.529> didn't<00:00:19.830> know<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
this one thing I didn't know this was a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.650 
this one thing I didn't know this was a
nice<00:00:21.029> little<00:00:23.090> instructions<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.420> moose

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
nice little instructions that moose

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
nice little instructions that moose
racing<00:00:25.080> gives<00:00:25.289> I've<00:00:25.830> never<00:00:26.039> dealt<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.340> them

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
racing gives I've never dealt with them

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
racing gives I've never dealt with them
before<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> says<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> well<00:00:28.199> packed

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
before but it says a well packed

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.370 
before but it says a well packed
silencer<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.029> core<00:00:30.480> gives<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
silencer which is this a core gives you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799 
silencer which is this a core gives you
more<00:00:31.590> than<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.099> quiet<00:00:32.309> engine<00:00:32.809> the

more than just a quiet engine the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
exhaust system back pressure which makes

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
exhaust system back pressure which makes

sense and tail pipe effective diameter

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.020 
sense and tail pipe effective diameter
are<00:00:38.520> both<00:00:38.670> critical<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:40.020> engine<00:00:40.410> performance

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
are both critical to engine performance

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.430 
are both critical to engine performance
over<00:00:42.030> time<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.540> filaments<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.230> bike's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
over time the filaments and your bike's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
over time the filaments and your bike's
muffler<00:00:43.920> becomes<00:00:44.719> packing<00:00:45.719> becomes<00:00:46.320> fracture

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
muffler becomes packing becomes fracture

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
muffler becomes packing becomes fracture
and<00:00:46.950> break<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.250> leaving<00:00:47.520> less<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> less

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and break off leaving less and less

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.119 
and break off leaving less and less
glass<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> says<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
glass in here so what it says is that

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
glass in here so what it says is that
the<00:00:56.129> packing<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> remains<00:00:57.030> becomes<00:00:57.420> clogged

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the packing that remains becomes clogged

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
the packing that remains becomes clogged
with<00:00:57.989> oily<00:00:58.410> carbon<00:00:58.829> everyone<00:00:59.219> knows<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
with oily carbon everyone knows this

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.799 
with oily carbon everyone knows this
leads<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> noisy<00:01:00.510> bike<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.739> correct

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
leads to a noisy bike which is correct

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
leads to a noisy bike which is correct
but<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.229> says<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.909> engine

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
but what it also says is that the engine

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.390 
but what it also says is that the engine
was<00:01:06.390> designed<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> tailpipe<00:01:07.830> with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
was designed to use a tailpipe with

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.210 
was designed to use a tailpipe with
specific<00:01:09.060> dimensions<00:01:10.250> length<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> diameter

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
specific dimensions length and diameter

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.060 
specific dimensions length and diameter
as<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:14.549> over<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.830> first<00:01:16.830> coat<00:01:17.040> of

as we go over to my first coat of
ceramic<00:01:17.640> paint<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
ceramic paint here and you can see the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
ceramic paint here and you can see the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
length in diameter as the muffler

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.770 
length in diameter as the muffler
packing<00:01:26.850> wears<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.920> stinger<00:01:28.920> diameter

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
packing wears out the stinger diameter

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
packing wears out the stinger diameter
which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:32.780> muffler<00:01:33.780> part<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.140> here
