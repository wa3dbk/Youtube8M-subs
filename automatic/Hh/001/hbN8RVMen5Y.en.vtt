 [Music] 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.380
 science in slow motion today run for 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.810
 a species that no longer needs to hunt 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.330
 escape predators the running has 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.240
 become a recreational sports activity or 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.370
 even therapeutic biomechanics studies 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.070
 among other things the way in which 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.780
 we run what muscles we use and what 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.269
 movements performs every part of the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.699
 body with the help of our super 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:49.449
 camera we can analyze in detail how 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:52.089
 we run we can start each cycle of 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.309
 trunk of the legs in three phases the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.289
 support phase that goes from one of 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.269
 the feet touch the ground until the 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.979
 center of gravity of the body is 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.999
 find with the vertical support of the 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.649
 standing there starts the momentum phase that 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:09.040
 it extends until the foot stops 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.110
 touching the ground is called the flight phase 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.729
 to the brief moment when none of 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.210
 the two feet is in contact with the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.250
 ground if we pay attention to the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 musculature we see that in each of 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 these phases are activated different 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.310
 muscles to meet different 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.860
 functions when the foot contacts the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.259
 soil at the beginning of phase support 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 the muscles of the quadriceps contract 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.789
 tibial muscle and flexor muscles and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.909
 extensors of the plant and fingers 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.890
 of the foot these muscles receive the 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.420
 impact and keep the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.009
 joints of the knee and the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.580
 ankle so that it does not flex 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.890
 too 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.110
 then one of the muscles of the quadriceps 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.600
 the rectus femoris continues to contract 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 and helps to accelerate the hip towards 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 ahead 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.469
 during the impulse phase they contract 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.240
 the glutes the twins and the soleus for 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.240
 push the hip forward 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.650
 in addition the twins the soleus and the plantar 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.560
 push the heel together 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.900
 upwards extending the foot flexes the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.590
 knee and along with the flexors of the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.810
 fingers give speed to the displacement in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.110
 the phase of flight the biceps muscle 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.480
 femoral is contracted by bringing the leg 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 of the thigh at this stage 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.020
 you always lose speed because the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.180
 body by not being in contact with the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.060
 soil can not generate any force 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.250
 that push it but running is not only 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.700
 move the legs on the top 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.350
 of the body is also happening all 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.110
 the arms accompany the movement of 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.400
 legs to maintain balance 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.860
 when the right leg goes towards 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.440
 forward the left arm also goes 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.480
 forward the broader the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 wider leg movement 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.130
 will be the arms in turn each 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.530
 arm counteracts the movement of the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.580
 leg on the same side favoring the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.460
 mechanical efficiency of displacement 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.160
 the muscles of the torso are relaxed 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.920
 this is particularly evident 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.840
 in the pectorals that move a lot 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.130
 every time a foot hits the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.070
 floor if we analyze the center of gravity 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.190
 of the body we will see that it oscillates in 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.530
 vertical drawing a parabola this 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.990
 parabola is proportional to the speed 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.420
 of the race and it is said that you should not 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.340
 exceed 24 centimeters to be 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.700
 efficient in terms of energy and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.400
 speed but that vertical oscillation 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.200
 she is not the only one who suffers the body if 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.780
 we draw the vertical of the center 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.360
 seriousness we will notice that the body oscillates 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.340
 towards your sides this is caused by 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.550
 the movement of the legs and the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.460
 Impact on the ground 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.780
 observe how the inclination of the 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.290
 hip in response to the support of the feet 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.670
 this series of hip movements 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.850
 minimizes the transmission of forces 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.440
 towards the upper part of the trunk 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 while the hip goes up and down 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.660
 in turn the shoulders are kept 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.670
 stable with respect to the horizontal 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.280
 the biomechanical analysis of 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.380
 runners is widely used in 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.510
 the world of sports to improve the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.060
 way to move when running increase 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.420
 the speed of mechanical efficiency and 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.450
 decrease extra energy expenses like 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.820
 close we leave you some tips on 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.760
 foot support should not be on the heel 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.280
 but closer to the tip the torso 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.000
 it has to be slightly inclined 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.950
 forward and with the head aligned 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.290
 the arms should move in the direction 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.560
 of the race and not crossing it ahead 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.650
 of the torso 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.380
 and as always warm up stretch 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.660
 the muscles hydrate and especially 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.080
 have a good time doing sports 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.060
 [Music] 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.720
 thank you very much Jorge for the demonstration 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.730
 scientific 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.570
 [Music] 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.120
 seemingly running in slow motion 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.210
 tires the same as running at speed 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.210
 normal
