00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hello UTB burn with fire and this is a pixel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.580
 world channel for those who have a taste 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.000
 black as old as a forester from the game 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 no of course i'm so old bloody 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.820
 how the hell not even a little more than a cradle 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.769
 up about like that definitely here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 so bloody scared me up 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.260
 shithead than I was even afraid to approach anyone 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 because of her the very thought of what it is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 in general, you can play caused me 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 disruption of all valves figuratively 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 Of course, although I was an unusually cycle 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.390
 you are a dick whip you will know his flood 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 same not breath introduced us park 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.559
 brought me to work sat down 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 ass on a chair tucked under his arm, his hand on 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 put another clav before his nose 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 the monitor and said play and I played 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 damn not literally long enough 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.170
 get it though then everything seemed to me 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 big through actually also rather 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.830
 just passed 1 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.690
 all due to the fact that I would be moody 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.310
 child and from that categorically 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 refuses to keep that bastard in 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.700
 hands and being on a row on cement 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.560
 I tested the tractor driver to everything that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.290
 it was only in the end I forgot about it on 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.310
 a couple of years until one my friend or girlfriend 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.960
 I do not remember 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 did not show me the second part of this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.260
 great game but about this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 stillborn freak i say no 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 I'll just be this unfortunate creature 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.130
 reminded me of my big brother and I 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.500
 being an ardent supporter of the mouse with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.950
 happily agreed again understand old 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.170
 kind of wonder how many new 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 learned about the game no i'm not talking about errors 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.180
 such films and works as 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:57.080
 fantasy ominous dead crows 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:58.729
 and also to many others i'm talking about 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.530
 so that carioca has something other than 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.229
 fucking dying from every country and 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.010
 Products that there is something about 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.010
 can kill 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.230
 find the keys and opens the door 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.810
 in general, everything is just like in real life 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.910
 with a glass of juice in the hands of paul whether the game 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 definitely not valegro suitable 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.170
 all i was when i played it 1 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 time 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.060
 Do I advise you to play it definitely 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.930
 but this is what is now fashionable to call 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.989
 old school 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.080
 have you been on fire everyone thank you all 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.080
 until
