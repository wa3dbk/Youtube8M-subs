00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.520
 so this league 1 we find ourselves for 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.379
 a real-time tool on a cabin at a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 wall ie a kind of armor 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 armor or that gathers the four armor 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.070
 of the game finally the 4 most 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 essential that is leather 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 to diamonds without going through the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600
 mesh rating is the rumor the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.100
 less used of the game by the less 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.029
 used way speak because we can 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 not used at all 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.130
 finally short if necessary it is painard you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.990
 will choose an armor between 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 four there and it's choosing those in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.380
 diamonds so you're going to wait for a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.320
 little bit that the torch hello for you 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 indicate that the armor has arrived safely on 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.059
 can wait a few minutes in the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 a few seconds 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 hmm so that's good it happened 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 so I beg you thanks to these is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.239
 a little bit special 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.710
 good for those who posed feels a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.270
 want to understand how that makes it 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.340
 pop and hop here I have my little armor 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.149
 the torch off and that's good 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.039
 now I 'm going to break myself 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.379
 I have my armor I have everything he has me 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 So here we go round I'm dressed 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.420
 quietly i'm painard that's it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.250
 so en route system is really good 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 frankly it not bad what in euros and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 armor for example diamond permit 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 where I clicked go let's say it's 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.470
 the whole section the sea ​​that goes that goes 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.450
 group all the equipment 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.380
 selarl from head to toe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.900
 there I now matter what like 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.340
 like equipment for example at the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.509
 Thursday all the equipment when I 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.960
 clicked will all go in the east have 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.479
 scare and leave in every disposition 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.860
 and round the torch there is going to be forgotten 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.630
 a crime sponsors for the last 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 has hours to show that everything is 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.310
 to be so good so it's a little bit 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 same basis as this system there so I'm going 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 show you as an example you are going to us 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.329
 do the same thing again during the game 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 put back it's an armor are never 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.250
 something there there too you can 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.720
 do not have to put armor too 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 could put equipment all 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.009
 just then that aliens slip on the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 button of a way that is reported you go 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.720
 cross all blogs 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.180
 to drop and who will go to reject 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.070
 an item so logically there is camille 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.240
 theme will not paradrent wanted to issue that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.620
 helmets for example it will do 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.410
 obliged to explain a headset up and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.400
 hop a people's helmet finally boots 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.570
 in plastron and people whose in one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.010
 other equipment it's a bit the same 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.560
 thing that is going to happen the crisis is only serving 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
 So here I am, I did not cut that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.110
 you'll see how it's going to be 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.370
 I put with two arms two errors that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.860
 I will make a small presentation 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.570
 so this tutorial I had already done before 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.980
 but finally already done I had already turned 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.630
 but I had a little mess in the video 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.520
 I was a little disturbed during I spoke 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.730
 so suddenly for the nook I had turned 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.050
 that and neck wholesale so that's when 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.300
 it's intuition would be like I you 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.480
 said all boxed items expelled 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.100
 in the big scared or partially and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.140
 that will be directed to a dee 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.820
 spencer so there it is that she already 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.450
 the head so the head is connected to this 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.790
 dispensary 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 so basically there is the boss who is going 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.040
 too tied to that there after so on 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.660
 legs there and feet there so in 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.709
 big when the last ones arrive here 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.200
 because it's those who take the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.150
 more time 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.680
 I put a signal finally a comparator 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.780
 who will detect items that went into 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.630
 the block and as long as it stays in the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.430
 block and ben the torch will stay on 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.870
 to show that there are always the items 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.940
 so basically if you take that the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.410
 part there the side wrongly I remain 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.900
 so it's kind of like that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.560
 if there would still be name armor 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.060
 so that's the fact a little 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.190
 demonstration I take back the armor in 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.200
 diamond take a little bit of time 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.890
 for example there are young helmet the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.290
 plastron hop it will happen 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.470
 and here is the tench is lit so 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.400
 here are the diamond boots by 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.640
 example if I take the boots in 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.640
 diamonds 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.330
 toasted hop so here I 'm dressed of 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.940
 from head to toe we round to hand so 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.750
 you saw the box left and the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.600
 extinct torch 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.370
 so basically it showed you that 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.560
 it was well connect the system is 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.000
 really not bad at a leather of course at 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 build I advise you then do 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.680
 it gives an underground base 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.080
 Finally, if you are in touch with sensations 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.360
 strong to live like in ermine in 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.920
 a cave after a good is your 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.610
 problem 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.790
 frankly I advise you rather 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.720
 oi to live in a cave with that 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.430
 finally the butcher a cave 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.350
 it's really a good thing because 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.400
 otherwise it takes a lot of space because 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.580
 that for example the if you make a 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.160
 ptit to market so that could do it 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.720
 but finally you understood me what that 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.400
 will be a little weird with all the 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.080
 Systems wide after good all the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000
 reston system must lara stone 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.350
 it's a bit logical so here we go 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.790
 will give the first system it was 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.220
 like that I wanted to make super compact 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.900
 but it does not work 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.510
 I do not know if by the way larionov 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.260
 will find the euro simply because 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.030
 that the items are going to make fun here 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.110
 my little block there because of the torch 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.000
 who sends dance to court and you 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.610
 afraid it was a just system all 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.380
 just to put some says 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.550
 think 1 over the other and hop it takes 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.460
 do it at least twice to make it 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.810
 not even his share so not in 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.180
 big so here it was pretty crappy 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.500
 move so fell I thought so go 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.380
 that's long I hope this tutorial has you 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.640
 please do not worry about the chain 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.680
 because you must have noticed that I 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.240
 do not do too many videos since I have 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.550
 saw work for a week and 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.240
 again next week 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.010
 Well, that's why I have 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.560
 started posting known game testing 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.210
 I did not have too many connections 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.230
 I posted some of them 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.490
 do not worry what in the third 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.460
 which costs abc game good icon game 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:45.070
 damn shit that's okay it's going to cut 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.340
 in the end it will cut all of a sudden 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.960
 just because everything fits 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.610
 simply because in fact at the end 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.669
 I bothered so I cut a 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.450
 blow not worry this is not a 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.700
 joke it's just like that 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.950
 so basically so these are the batteries at the 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.740
 end of the video my I tell you that I 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.290
 break me and that finally here is hope 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.970
 this series already interests you that I 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.140
 do not know I launched like that I 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.360
 did not even in 4 hours I already 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.160
 finished there are 22 episodes and where so 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.800
 so here I hope that this series you 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.150
 will please and that this tutorial too so I will you 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.400
 tell next to the next 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.400
 episodes on tutorials and all
