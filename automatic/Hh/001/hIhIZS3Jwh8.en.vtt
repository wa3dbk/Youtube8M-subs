use<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.739> circuit<00:03:27.160> for<00:03:27.989> burglar

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
use it here is the circuit for burglar

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.330 
use it here is the circuit for burglar
alarm<00:03:29.400> similar<00:03:30.400> one<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:31.420> only<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.920> led

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
alarm similar one that only but the led

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.839 
alarm similar one that only but the led
which<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.849> have<00:03:34.120> used<00:03:34.300> earlier<00:03:34.569> here<00:03:35.849> instead

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
which I have used earlier here instead

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.290 
which I have used earlier here instead
of<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.150> led<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:38.640> taken<00:03:39.640> out<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.910> LED

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
of that led I have taken out that LED

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.590 
of that led I have taken out that LED
and<00:03:40.540> put<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.110> buzzer<00:03:41.319> pin<00:03:41.709> over<00:03:41.950> there<00:03:42.600> diet

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
and put the buzzer pin over there diet

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.070 
and put the buzzer pin over there diet
from<00:03:43.930> pin<00:03:44.590> 1519<00:03:46.380> yeah<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.420> provided<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
from pin 1519 yeah so I have provided a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.979 
from pin 1519 yeah so I have provided a
source<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.440> light<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:53.019> LDR<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:55.209> instead

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
source of light here for LDR so instead

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.580 
source of light here for LDR so instead
of<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.470> tube<00:03:56.680> light<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:58.630> will<00:03:58.690> use<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.110> LED

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
of the tube light we will use this LED

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.610 
of the tube light we will use this LED
as<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.010> source<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.370> light<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:01.349> this<00:04:02.349> you<00:04:02.470> can

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
as the source of light and this you can

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.949 
as the source of light and this you can
attach<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.970> LED<00:04:04.450> with<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.349> battery<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
attach this LED with the battery to the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.890 
attach this LED with the battery to the
one<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:09.160> side<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.610> door<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.660> next

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
one one side of the door and to the next

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.199 
one one side of the door and to the next
door<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.349> can<00:04:11.500> attach<00:04:11.799> LDR<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.850> circuit

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
door you can attach LDR and this circuit

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.650 
door you can attach LDR and this circuit
of<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> circuit<00:04:17.609> switch<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.789> two<00:04:19.450> plates

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
of the circuit switch of the two plates

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.560 
of the circuit switch of the two plates
I<00:04:21.060> am<00:04:22.060> attaching<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.600> battery<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.240> source

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
I am attaching the battery so a source

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.520 
I am attaching the battery so a source
of<00:04:28.720> light<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.140> provided<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> LDR<00:04:31.500> when<00:04:32.500> I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
of light is provided to the LDR when I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.000 
of light is provided to the LDR when I
block<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.220> source<00:04:33.640> of<00:04:33.789> light<00:04:34.000> or<00:04:34.720> if<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.710> open

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
block the source of light or if I open

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.490 
block the source of light or if I open
the<00:04:36.100> door<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:37.270> LDR<00:04:37.630> will<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:38.050> receive<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the door the LDR will not receive the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.879 
the door the LDR will not receive the
light<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.360> happens<00:04:40.870> like<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.440> the

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
light so it happens like this and the

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.620 
light so it happens like this and the
buzzer<00:04:42.100> will<00:04:42.340> be

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.070 

can<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.720> hear<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.450> ldr<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:52.870> not

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
can you hear it so the ldr is not

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.700 
can you hear it so the ldr is not
receiving<00:04:53.500> light<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.760> buzzer<00:04:55.120> will<00:04:55.389> beep

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
receiving light and the buzzer will beep

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:06.550 
receiving light and the buzzer will beep
like<00:04:56.710> this

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.650 

so<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.889> is<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.039> simple<00:05:08.520> circuit<00:05:08.669> for<00:05:09.180> burglar

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
so this is a simple circuit for burglar

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.990 
so this is a simple circuit for burglar
alarm
