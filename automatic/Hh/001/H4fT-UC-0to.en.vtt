00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
to get those ends on there because the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.789 
to get those ends on there because the
if<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.510> interest<00:03:53.870> rate<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.349> kind<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.620> messes

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
if the interest rate it kind of messes

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.580 
if the interest rate it kind of messes
up<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.250> look<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.970> then<00:03:58.970> this<00:03:59.269> curl<00:03:59.690> I'm<00:04:00.079> going

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
up the look and then this curl I'm going

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.629 
up the look and then this curl I'm going
to<00:04:00.950> roll<00:04:01.849> going<00:04:02.480> towards<00:04:02.780> my<00:04:03.379> face<00:04:03.739> by

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
to roll going towards my face by

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.280 
to roll going towards my face by
alternating<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:06.230> way<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.560> roll<00:04:07.450> your<00:04:08.450> hair

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
alternating the way you roll your hair

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.159 
alternating the way you roll your hair
it<00:04:09.530> gives<00:04:09.889> more<00:04:10.250> volume<00:04:10.819> so<00:04:11.180> every<00:04:11.629> curl<00:04:11.959> is

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
it gives more volume so every curl is

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.650 
it gives more volume so every curl is
not<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:13.280> same<00:04:13.549> and<00:04:13.879> it's<00:04:14.030> not<00:04:14.209> going<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.569> the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
not the same and it's not going in the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.319 
not the same and it's not going in the
same<00:04:14.900> direction<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.400> time<00:04:16.609> I'm<00:04:16.849> going<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
same direction so this time I'm going to

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.289 
same direction so this time I'm going to
roll<00:04:17.599> it<00:04:17.840> going<00:04:18.709> toward<00:04:19.310> my<00:04:19.639> face<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.209> I'm

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
going to alternate that going all the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.940 
going to alternate that going all the
way<00:04:22.400> around<00:04:22.580> my<00:04:22.969> head

broken<00:05:24.880> off<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.360> feel<00:05:25.570> like<00:05:25.630> it's<00:05:25.840> due<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.200> that

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
broken off I feel like it's due to that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.880 
broken off I feel like it's due to that
so<00:05:26.710> I'm<00:05:26.830> gonna<00:05:27.070> stick<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.910> all<00:05:28.300> natural<00:05:29.169> and

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.659 

then<00:05:32.890> i<00:05:32.919> use<00:05:33.310> my<00:05:33.580> olive<00:05:34.030> oil<00:05:34.570> is<00:05:34.900> control<00:05:35.890> on<00:05:36.340> my
