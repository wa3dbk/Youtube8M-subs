aren't nurtures your soul it gives you

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.390 
aren't nurtures your soul it gives you
another<00:00:09.870> way<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> looking<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.679> things<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
another way of looking at things it

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.129 
another way of looking at things it
takes<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> places<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.900> wouldn't

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
takes you to places that you wouldn't

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.099 
takes you to places that you wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:13.259> go<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:14.340> own<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:15.120> does<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> lot

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
necessarily go on your own it does a lot

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
necessarily go on your own it does a lot
of<00:00:16.170> different<00:00:16.470> things<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.730> pieces<00:00:18.090> in

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
of different things these pieces in

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.800 
of different things these pieces in
particular<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> bubble<00:00:19.320> tubes<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:20.570> think<00:00:21.570> have

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
particular the bubble tubes I think have

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.259 
particular the bubble tubes I think have
that<00:00:22.050> component<00:00:22.410> where<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.670> enjoy<00:00:23.820> them

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that component where you can enjoy them

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.410 
that component where you can enjoy them
on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.350> art<00:00:25.560> level<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.240> there's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
on the art level but I think there's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200 
on the art level but I think there's
also<00:00:27.630> something<00:00:28.050> else<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:29.910> they're<00:00:30.179> very

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
also something else I think they're very

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.549 
also something else I think they're very
meditative<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:33.050> everybody<00:00:34.050> knows<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
meditative and everybody knows at this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
meditative and everybody knows at this
point<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.130> meditation<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.239> good<00:00:36.480> for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
point the meditation is really good for

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
point the meditation is really good for
you<00:00:36.809> anything<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.190> slow<00:00:39.090> your

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you anything you can do to slow your

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
you anything you can do to slow your
brain<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:40.219> is<00:00:41.540> beneficial<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.140> problem<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
brain down is beneficial the problem is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
brain down is beneficial the problem is
it's<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.879> darn<00:00:45.149> hard<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.629> meditate<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.829> know

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it's so darn hard to meditate you know

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
it's so darn hard to meditate you know
our<00:00:47.070> brains<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> move<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> fast<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
our brains want to move so fast that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.720 
our brains want to move so fast that
it's<00:00:48.719> hard<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.200> take<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> step<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.250> slow

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's hard to take a step back and slow

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.779 
it's hard to take a step back and slow
it<00:00:50.879> down<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.320> find<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> watch

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it down but I find that when you watch

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:06.620 
it down but I find that when you watch
these<00:00:54.059> pieces<00:00:55.039> it<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> takes<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.879> there

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.649 

art<00:01:07.630> special<00:01:08.229> in<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.680> many<00:01:08.860> ways<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.270> very

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
art special in so many ways on a very

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.590 
art special in so many ways on a very
basic<00:01:10.960> level<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.800> think<00:01:12.550> art<00:01:12.940> is<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:13.240> makes<00:01:13.420> us

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
basic level I think art is what makes us

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.010 
basic level I think art is what makes us
human<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:15.640> we<00:01:15.790> look<00:01:15.970> at<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> entire<00:01:16.509> Animal

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
human when we look at the entire Animal

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.290 
human when we look at the entire Animal
Kingdom<00:01:17.049> there<00:01:18.009> are<00:01:18.280> lots<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.880> creatures<00:01:19.090> that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
Kingdom there are lots of creatures that

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.090 
Kingdom there are lots of creatures that
have<00:01:19.600> language<00:01:20.080> there<00:01:20.500> are<00:01:20.530> lots<00:01:20.950> of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
have language there are lots of

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.010 
have language there are lots of
creatures<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.550> use<00:01:21.850> tools<00:01:22.240> there<00:01:22.630> are<00:01:22.750> other

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
creatures that use tools there are other

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.080 
creatures that use tools there are other
things<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.680> think<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.159> being<00:01:24.430> special

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
things that we think of as being special

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.630 
things that we think of as being special
but<00:01:26.340> we're<00:01:27.340> not<00:01:27.460> unique<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:29.190> but<00:01:30.190> in<00:01:30.310> art<00:01:30.490> we

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
but we're not unique in but in art we

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.770 
but we're not unique in but in art we
are<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:32.020> can't<00:01:32.590> think<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:33.100> other<00:01:34.000> animals<00:01:34.240> play

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
are I can't think of other animals play

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.810 
are I can't think of other animals play
but<00:01:35.289> I<00:01:35.320> don't<00:01:35.560> know<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.890> any<00:01:36.070> other<00:01:36.190> animals

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
but I don't know of any other animals

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.749 
but I don't know of any other animals
