00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.549
 Personal speech is starting another tone. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 well in the kitchen today we will 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.500
 teach you how to make a sandwich 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.080
 eggplant and sandwich is delicious that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.639
 taxed as mortadella and cheese 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.850
 but you can leave with several other 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.180
 Things so let's learn to do is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.990
 very easy you will see it just start to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.410
 cut our eggplant and medium slices 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 more or less like you're seeing there is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 more or less a finger wide 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 just cut all your slices each 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.000
 slice will be one side of your sandwich 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 so now what are you going to do? 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 will separate the next slices 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 then each next slice will be a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 sandwich to fit and the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.140
 sandwich stay in legal format the people 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.420
 so will start withdrawing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.129
 I'm putting a little cheese 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 a bit of mortadella and that's when I 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.039
 I place cheese on top not important 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.379
 stuffing that full is not that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.200
 smell that is sticking out it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.680
 need to stay inside the sandwich 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 So you calm down, do not try to close 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 So much for not jumping out. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.030
 and as I said at the beginning of the video you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.979
 you can use other fillings, I think it 's 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
 one cool thing that should stay here is the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.350
 salame salame a little saltier than 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.799
 the mortadella so I think it's up to a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.329
 little better here with the eggplant 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.600
 when we have eggplant ready 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.570
 closed, we are going to prepare the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.880
 our fingers are just putting two eggs 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.860
 in a bowl a little milk one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.439
 a little salt a little pepper 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.439
 ground and beat with a fork 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.690
 and we can now defrost each of the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.479
 sandwiches 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.040
 just get your sandwich to pass a 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.810
 little in the flour 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.630
 You do not have to spend much on flour. 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.420
 of wheat is a light layer after 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.430
 flour you will take then to the egg goes 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.430
 cover everything very well with beaten egg 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.670
 and after the egg you will carry the flour 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.489
 now you're going to eat 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 rather than normal flour 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.280
 until everything is well covered 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 and so that you stay very well in the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.459
 sides is just turning around like you 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.640
 Seeing that it catches a lot 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.340
 thread flour then repeating again 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.500
 it is in wheat flour just a little 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.069
 then the beaten egg and finally the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.069
 breadcrumbs 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.410
 you are doing it with all the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.470
 your sandwiches and now you're ready 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.030
 to bring it to the oven in a way 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 with aluminum foil you will play a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.359
 little olive oil under each 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.099
 sandwich 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.220
 so just toss a little olive oil 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:18.379
 put the sandwich on top of each 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.379
 entry you give in your form 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.660
 now you're going to roll quite a bit 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.660
 parmesan on top of each sandwich 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.830
 and you'll end up with one more 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.200
 a little olive oil on top of each one 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.500
 it is important for you to place the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.260
 olive oil because it will give a fry and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.150
 will crispy leave your sandwich 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.780
 You'll take it to the oven for more or 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.210
 ten minutes at 220 degrees but ten 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.730
 minutes on each side then after 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.800
 You draw after ten minutes. 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.800
 You will turn each one of your sandwich 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.099
 will roll a little more cheese in 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:11.019
 each one of them and you will take it again 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.819
 to the oven at 200 20 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.349
 your sandwich is ready 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.320
 Did you see that he's a little bit longer? 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.870
 dark it is very hot and now a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.830
 very important tip is very important 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.690
 that you leave this sandwich and cool 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.580
 fully before eating it is not a 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.790
 sandwich to eat hot when he 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.130
 For cooling it will improve the taste. 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.820
 It gets better and better 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.139
 less trawling gets really hot 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.310
 and the filling gets too much. 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.530
 the eggplant 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.590
 I hope you liked it then. 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.340
 healthy recipe 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.539
