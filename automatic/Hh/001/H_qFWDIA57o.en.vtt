 The package is shorter than 100 grams. 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.990
 let's see what's here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.380
 is generally like the seller packed everything 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.959

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.429
 nozzles well, here's a wide one 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:56.090
 worth these leashes grinding buy on 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.200
 there is no box to destroy the package all 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.959
 yourself first or it just we donâ€™t know 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.329
 here we opened in short here such here 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.150
 original box 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.980
 there was a graphic sticker here 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.560
 some 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.230
 all designations that go here 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.799
 use millimeter jack all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.250
 quotes relies microphone there 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:29.090
 Headphones are available in seven colors. 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.849
 I ordered the greens let's open it 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.909
 and that the first we see here is such 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:41.249
 such a box is a case 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:46.710
 instruction in Chinese and English 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:49.140
 in the language of such a case 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.970
 there is some kind of plastic 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 it turns out always has this form 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.400
 case itself and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 headphones are not likely to fall out 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.280
 just here if the attack and hold up let 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.230
 you have to stand rezinochki dreams 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.980
 Ottoman who lead slept but not 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.430
 breaks down 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.030
 what's strange then go the headphones themselves 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.660
 I certainly expected that the color will be slightly 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.300
 a little better i thought green would 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.220
 bright sun or is it yellow actually 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.560
 red-yellow headphones last not 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.010
 sent yellow although I order endowed 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.720
 we can see that green is here to add 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.140
 this metal from me came on yellow 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.150
 study does not go so confusing 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.240
 it will be difficult and here is such a microphone 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.910
 microphone headphones here is nothing 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.640
 regulated it is written in this one 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.940
 the thing is metal is what next 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.170
 then comes here is such a box 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.870
 here we see 4 nozzles are obtained as 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.200
 would just come complete 3 live 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.940
 nozzles that's where the little two big 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.950
 here is one and average what else to say 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.620
 really want like nothing put 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.660
