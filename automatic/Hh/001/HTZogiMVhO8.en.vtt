of<00:02:21.599> concept<00:02:22.140> albums<00:02:22.470> where<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.250> would<00:02:23.430> play

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
of concept albums where you would play

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.360

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
the whole album and it would feel like

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.949 
the whole album and it would feel like
you<00:02:26.370> know<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.700> movie<00:02:27.120> never<00:02:27.330> being<00:02:27.540> filmed

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
you know like a movie never being filmed

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.470 
you know like a movie never being filmed
so<00:02:28.440> I've<00:02:28.590> always<00:02:28.800> tried<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.180> own

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
so I've always tried when I make my own

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.800 
so I've always tried when I make my own
CDs<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.650> make<00:02:31.800> albums<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.269> could<00:02:33.480> start

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
CDs to make albums that you could start

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.020 
CDs to make albums that you could start
and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:35.010> could<00:02:35.190> listen<00:02:35.850> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and then you know you could listen to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170 
and then you know you could listen to
instead<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.900> having<00:02:37.680> an<00:02:37.980> album<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.549> 15

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
instead of having an album with 15

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.970 
instead of having an album with 15
individual<00:02:39.930> tracks<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.769> basically

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
individual tracks that you can basically

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.430 
individual tracks that you can basically
make<00:02:41.340> mix<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.269> match<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.989> would<00:02:43.140> still<00:02:43.380> be

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
make mix and match and it would still be

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.350 
make mix and match and it would still be
you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> same<00:02:44.340> thing<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.760> love<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you know the same thing I love the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240 
you know the same thing I love the
storytelling<00:02:45.930> every<00:02:46.410> project<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.010> take

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
storytelling every project that I take

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.720 
storytelling every project that I take
on<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.790> try<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.330> rethink<00:02:49.310> how<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> could<00:02:50.610> do

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
on I try to rethink how I could do

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.789 
on I try to rethink how I could do
things<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.239> how<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.450> could<00:02:51.840> not<00:02:52.170> only<00:02:52.319> push<00:02:52.620> my

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
things and how I could not only push my

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.240 
things and how I could not only push my
own<00:02:52.950> boundaries<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.760> also<00:02:55.250> pushing

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
own boundaries but also pushing

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.979 
own boundaries but also pushing
boundaries<00:02:56.580> for<00:02:56.880> music<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.390> general<00:02:57.510> that's

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
boundaries for music in general that's

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.440 
boundaries for music in general that's
the<00:02:58.230> beauty<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> working<00:02:59.549> on<00:02:59.819> films<00:03:00.150> because

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the beauty of working on films because

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.360 
the beauty of working on films because
he<00:03:00.630> gets<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.080> much<00:03:01.530> opportunity<00:03:01.739> especially

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
he gets so much opportunity especially

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.759 
he gets so much opportunity especially
in<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.000> film<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.660> Robert<00:03:04.200> he<00:03:04.290> gave<00:03:04.470> me<00:03:04.590> so

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
in this film with Robert he gave me so

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.220 
in this film with Robert he gave me so
much<00:03:04.920> freedom<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.519> experiment<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.989> try<00:03:07.140> all

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
much freedom to experiment and try all

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
much freedom to experiment and try all
kinds<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.709> different<00:03:08.040> things<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.519> that's<00:03:09.480> why

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
kinds of different things and that's why

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.880 
kinds of different things and that's why
it<00:03:09.720> worked<00:03:10.049> out<00:03:10.170> really<00:03:10.230> well

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
