00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
what's the easiest way to get out of

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.350 
what's the easiest way to get out of
your<00:01:00.070> way<00:01:00.220> well<00:01:00.820> let's<00:01:00.970> just<00:01:01.120> make<00:01:01.210> an

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
your way well let's just make an

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.880 
your way well let's just make an
assumption<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:02.290> don't<00:01:02.440> have<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.590> believe<00:01:02.710> it

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
assumption you don't have to believe it

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.289 
assumption you don't have to believe it
but<00:01:03.100> let's<00:01:03.250> just<00:01:03.340> assume<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.000> then<00:01:04.089> see

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
but let's just assume it and then see

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.380 
but let's just assume it and then see
where<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.479> go<00:01:04.689> with<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.960> if<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:06.369> assume<00:01:06.759> that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
where you go with it if you assume that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.580 
where you go with it if you assume that
you<00:01:07.780> are<00:01:08.159> divinity<00:01:09.159> or<00:01:09.400> love<00:01:10.090> or<00:01:10.450> source<00:01:11.200> or

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
you are divinity or love or source or

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.990 
you are divinity or love or source or
energy<00:01:13.439> those<00:01:14.439> things<00:01:14.890> are<00:01:15.340> all<00:01:15.700> represented

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
energy those things are all represented

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.260 
energy those things are all represented
through<00:01:16.600> perfection<00:01:17.409> that's<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.250> love<00:01:18.970> isn't

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
through perfection that's it love isn't

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.130 
through perfection that's it love isn't
not<00:01:19.930> perfect<00:01:20.590> divinity<00:01:21.370> source<00:01:22.180> nature

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
not perfect divinity source nature

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.950 
not perfect divinity source nature
energy<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:24.010> actually<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:24.430> neutral<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.840> all

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
energy is actually just neutral so all

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.140 
energy is actually just neutral so all
those<00:01:26.110> things<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.470> perfect<00:01:26.680> so<00:01:27.460> anytime<00:01:27.909> you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
those things are perfect so anytime you

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.770 
those things are perfect so anytime you
think<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.600> thought<00:01:28.930> about<00:01:29.500> yourself<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
think a thought about yourself that is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500 
think a thought about yourself that is
less<00:01:32.049> than<00:01:32.080> perfect<00:01:32.590> you're<00:01:33.490> not<00:01:33.760> honoring

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
less than perfect you're not honoring

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.870 
less than perfect you're not honoring
the<00:01:34.900> perfection<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.560> who<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:35.860> are<00:01:36.010> so<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:36.850> you

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the perfection of who you are so all you

the perfection of who you are so all you
got<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.180> try<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.390> do<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.930> stop<00:01:38.350> thinking<00:01:38.830> and

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
got to try to do is stop thinking and

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.800 
got to try to do is stop thinking and
telling<00:01:39.430> yourself<00:01:39.790> things<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.510> are<00:01:40.630> not<00:01:40.780> in

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
telling yourself things that are not in

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.859 
telling yourself things that are not in
alignment<00:01:41.200> with<00:01:41.470> what<00:01:41.860> your<00:01:42.549> perfection<00:01:43.150> so

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
alignment with what your perfection so

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.149 
alignment with what your perfection so
easy<00:01:44.940> but<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:47.290> we're<00:01:47.619> trying<00:01:47.950> to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
easy but not because we're trying to

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.830 
easy but not because we're trying to
beat<00:01:48.310> ourselves<00:01:48.430> up<00:01:48.850> with<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.390> things<00:01:49.630> that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
beat ourselves up with the things that

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.810 
beat ourselves up with the things that
we<00:01:49.960> constantly<00:01:50.380> tell<00:01:50.680> ourselves<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:51.460> are

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
we constantly tell ourselves that are

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
we constantly tell ourselves that are
not<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.330> alignment<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.299> I'm<00:01:55.630> going

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
not in alignment with that so I'm going

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.590 
not in alignment with that so I'm going
