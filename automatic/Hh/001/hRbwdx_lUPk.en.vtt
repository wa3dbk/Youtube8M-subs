00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 jack jack what is 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.210
 2 ideas have appeared yes I have some 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.090
 but for a start they think we will go to that city 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.460
 shared and read that letter at leisure and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.260
 you know there is my benefit too 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.000
 I guess I'll go with you but only 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 I think it will not harm you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.699
 so do not worry 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.490
 you know, for a start, climb a mountain there 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.070
 still near the church stands overall i remember 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.710
 from there review win how many ships 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.070
 now the city can be 1 up to succeed 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.989
 whistle on I have a couple of ideas well 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.170
 in general, itâ€™s worth to go first 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 even so prepare your gear 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 take a gun and a little food path will be 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.460
 long well what jack what what i think 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 now it's not far away 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.399
 roads are not already there will soon be a new 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 the road is even in front of the city 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.799
 you know before people died in these 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 places 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.729
 now it seems like travelers are walking nothing 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.229
 What's so unusual about what happened before 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.630
 every animal you know watch bandits 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:24.619
 there is no road no one will find rain 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 you see it wolves leaders don't shoot 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.750
 too early if we start now with 3 years 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 no one will end up with anything good 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.159
 so move away 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.289
 the main thing that they did not devour 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.119
 hide in the bushes go here think 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.409
 wait a little bit like they are bitten 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.360
 some kind of partridge 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.270
 maybe you're a puck yes no travelers here 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.170
 rarely do I definitely hardly go before 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.819
 but they died too now 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.490
 as long as there is no other way 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.100
 sea she is my fishing boat especially 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.060
 you don't go far 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.120
 so so so okay try to get through 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.829
 here the main thing is not to hurry and not attracting 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.190
 yourself their attention comes we go damn 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.190
 mountain 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.680
 should try to go along the mountain 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.569
 I hope they don't mind us, that's all 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.700
 killed we came here she is the outskirts of nothing 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 imagine what a frigate such a never 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.140
 saw a beautiful ship of something the operator 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.890
 By the way, little go and got drunk already yes 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.670
 went to sleep and someone in the taverns sits like this 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.760
 so but there is a couple of sentries on the ship 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.069
 to you on volume 1 but just a pitiful handful 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.349
 there used to be such crowds 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.400
 you are not attaching the path there now and 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.500
 will decorate the ship 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 No, of course, that just went 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
 despite the fact that they are not all 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.319
 even if we kill you, you know very strongly 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.170
 do not come close to them or they may 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.400
 notice such an idea means 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.769
 we have to do a red herring 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.390
 for this we need gunpowder the city is 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.549
 one person who can help us 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.120
 Well, for a fee, but I have a certain amount 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.920
 Your own benefit helps you so much to us 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 need gunpowder here close and old 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.209
 spanish vault they have long been 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.880
 abandoned but pores stayed there i remember 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.639
 very close you can go on my 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.549
 fishing boat collect pores from there 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.639
 blow up some building or ship 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.980
 they are clearly going to come running and at that moment we 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.069
 we can go to the empty frigate 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.410
 pick it up and go to the open sea you 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:56.250
 you think it will work and we have others 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:59.280
 options no okay it's time to leave then already 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.750
 sleep hunt listen zhka here two or three 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.870
 Spaniard cooks miles left 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.690
 I think not far 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.330
 Pavelko stand certainly not so 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.860
 this fishing vessel happened 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.079
 listen to me very urgently need to deliver 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.090
 this letter if I do not deliver it can 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.880
 war will happen 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 I understand it has its benefits have you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.050
 spoke and we can say common goals 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.270
 just me a little but in the other side 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.449
 you do not worry everything will be fine and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.789
 a letter from you deliver yashka as if 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.490
 rejuvenated 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.150
 we just have to go for 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.500
 cook some food finally jack i 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.370
 smell the sea 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:54.520
 after all, and blows my hair, my God, how 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.350
 great to be afloat okay 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.070
 watch tantra you have not eaten forest and then 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.970
 how could we not even raise 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.970
 what
