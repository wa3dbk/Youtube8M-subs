00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 or if I'm back with a video for 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.360
 I have my months again 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 gefallen together from the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.500
 december logically so the big one 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.269
 christmas month and i have at 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 Find month favorites 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.250
 I actually realized that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 christmas in my month's favorites 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 that has manifested itself on the one hand 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 in this bright red lips color here 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 that is patrice's manifestation 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.679
 majors days with the polish in let's get 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 loud and that's a really nice one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.550
 cherry red and I found it at christmas 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 just totally great, I say Christmas Eve 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 on the lips and also I think so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 even to New Year's Eve and also 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.230
 That's what it was at the beginning of December 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.030
 really somehow I have such a thing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 already thought of christmas and have on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.120
 red lipstick thought on eyelashes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.129
 I also have a little bit different 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.980
 worn as usual and this one here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.129
 by leni lesch this is number 114 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.800
 and they were just the more glamorous ones 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 hamzic zack pattern and have easy 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 a little more special 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
 I usually wear eyelashes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 which look relatively natural, then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.060
 not today but otherwise 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.100
 and these were just a lot 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.830
 more glamorous and therefore a lot 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 Christmassy and then I have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.350
 again a very long loved palette 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 unearthed the one night in the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 rocco and has so dreamy 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 eyeshadow so she has lips too 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.570
 colors but I do not like and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 never use them but these 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.479
 eyeshadow colors are so incredible 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 nice the palette are between relative 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.540
 hard to get but if you are 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 somehow approaches and such colors 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.189
 like the shadows, then it really works 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.320
 they are wonderfully pigmented 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.600
 Apply very well and shimmer 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.649
 nice and i just love her because of it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 Then you're pretty cold again 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.520
 in december has my skin 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.530
 Really a whole lot of extra care 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 used and I like full 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 here this mask taken by alcina the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.579
 That's the red miracle 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.030
 and that is actually red and has 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.799
 so a very strange such 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.329
 consistency so she looks like going 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.980
 but if you wear them on then she is 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.400
 somehow relative 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.130
 So I would have run away completely 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.320
 It also smells very good and looks good too 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.870
 very light red then out of open face 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.060
 and very shiny so it somehow 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.610
 unlike others, you usually masquerade like that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.470
 had and that really supplies the skin 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.110
 I am really good with moisture 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 urgently needed in winter 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.590
 and before that I always have from that one 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.890
 this is where this scrub is applied 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.100
 The often peeling that is a chemical 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.140
 So do not peel with small peeling 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.630
 particles in it but just one with 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 Enzyme and that's a powder in here 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.360
 and you just do it on the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.550
 palm or you can do it in such a way 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.110
 do small bowl or something in 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.920
 It's enough for me, it's just enough 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.950
 to do the hand 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.840
 and then you do a little bit 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.630
 cool water you can not compete 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.580
 Warm water can do this otherwise 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.190
 enzymes and they break down a bit 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 just cool water on it and then 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.870
 If you lend that it will be relative 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 but all so very white foam 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620
 and then you can just face it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.300
 give and then let it go a bit 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 and you can either dry it 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.459
 let it go over and over again 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.540
 with wet hands then it is too 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.130
 So I do it quite like in the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.810
 I'll take care of that and then 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.440
 again and again with the hands short 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.390
 zoom go 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.550
 and then afterwards the mask and the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.989
 Both are really good in the team 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.120
 I have this for my hair 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.820
 rausgekramt again that is the macadamia 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.800
 Healing a treatment and that was what I had 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.300
 really like to use my hair 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.790
 were very long but there I had 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 partly also the feeling it has 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.100
 a nice effect but not so 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.540
 not that rich enough for mine 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.340
 Hair as I had the feeling I 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.620
 need with the long hair then 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.450
 more fat and then have pure coconut oil 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.160
 taken and then that's why for 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.750
 side posed and then the hair 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.370
 they were as good as short 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.940
 no use, I also care 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.010
 not used 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.020
 and now that she's at least one again 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 Idea has been coming for a while 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.830
 really good again and I have it again 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 rausgeholt and it has such a nice 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.780
 oily consistency but complains the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.239
 Do not hair too much and I do 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 always just after washing your hair 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.360
 so the tips do not come in 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.100
 approach I do not need but so 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.320
 in the top and the hair are after 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.730
 pretty good to know that at the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.040
 Frankly, I seldom complain 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.840
 problem is but they let themselves 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.550
 easy to manage and feel afterwards 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.280
 Good and the tips feel 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.350
 just a little bit well kept there and 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.490
 it's actually my foot right now 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.290
 fell asleep because I was there all the time 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.390
 here sitting cross-legged on the sofa 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.250
 I like that fragrance in december 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.850
 That's right from Christina 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.910
 aguilera 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.980
 the puma phone and that has something 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.430
 Light clooney is actually mine 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.800
 opinion after no winter air 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.450
 well, where I find it very difficult too 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.880
 say I would say that you are 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.130
 even in winter and in spring and also 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.570
 I do not wear so well in the summer 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.580
 can 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.580
 it's kind of between 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.570
 flowery and not too heavy and yet 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.390
 somehow very luxurious I am very 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.490
 own what is likely and only finds 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.950
 rarely a few funds what I like 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.240
 and was surprised that I did that 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.460
 Here you can go again 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.950
 through my last favorites video and 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.140
 click on an entire favorites playlist 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.910
 with all favorite videos i 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.730
 I've ever done it and I can 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.020
 say that's pretty much meanwhile 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.520
 and I wish you a miracle 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.290
 wonderful day and hope we see 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.290
 We soon bit again bye
