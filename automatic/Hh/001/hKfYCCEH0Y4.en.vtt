00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.410 
all right today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.469 
all right today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:02.620> to<00:00:02.680> break<00:00:02.980> into<00:00:03.220> a<00:00:03.399> master<00:00:03.940> lock<00:00:04.149> done

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:04.479 
how to break into a master lock done

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:06.900 
how to break into a master lock done
lock<00:00:04.979> it's<00:00:05.979> pretty<00:00:06.279> simple

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
lock it's pretty simple

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.620 
lock it's pretty simple
-<00:00:07.809> spring<00:00:08.170> loaded<00:00:10.530> caption<00:00:11.530> right<00:00:11.740> here<00:00:12.630> just

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
- spring loaded caption right here just

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.080 
- spring loaded caption right here just
push<00:00:13.960> it<00:00:14.140> in<00:00:14.260> back<00:00:14.560> and<00:00:14.769> forth<00:00:15.010> and<00:00:15.670> what<00:00:15.820> does

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
push it in back and forth and what does

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.489 
push it in back and forth and what does
those<00:00:16.359> teeth<00:00:16.769> grab<00:00:17.769> on<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.220> the<00:00:18.339> tumbler<00:00:18.759> here

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:19.499 
those teeth grab on to the tumbler here

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.529 
those teeth grab on to the tumbler here
I've<00:00:20.499> already<00:00:20.740> disassembled<00:00:21.640> everything

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
I've already disassembled everything

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.929 
I've already disassembled everything
taking<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:22.960> apart<00:00:23.230> taking<00:00:23.739> off<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.730> rubber

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
taking it apart taking off the rubber

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.700 
taking it apart taking off the rubber
pad<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.570> you<00:00:25.630> get<00:00:25.839> an<00:00:25.929> idea<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.439> how<00:00:26.650> the

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
pad so you get an idea of how the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.579 
pad so you get an idea of how the
mechanics<00:00:27.400> work<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.849> this<00:00:28.029> so<00:00:29.019> what<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.199> do<00:00:29.439> is

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
mechanics work on this so what I do is

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.280 
mechanics work on this so what I do is
go<00:00:29.710> ahead<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:29.980> put<00:00:30.069> it<00:00:30.189> back<00:00:30.279> together<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:31.290> you

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
go ahead and put it back together so you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.920 
go ahead and put it back together so you
can<00:00:32.560> see<00:00:32.800> what<00:00:33.070> you<00:00:33.190> got<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.430> do<00:00:33.840> even<00:00:34.840> though

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
can see what you got to do even though

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.020 
can see what you got to do even though
it's<00:00:35.140> not<00:00:35.290> on<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.500> gun<00:00:35.800> right<00:00:36.250> now<00:00:36.460> you<00:00:36.820> can

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
it's not on a gun right now you can

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.240 
it's not on a gun right now you can
still<00:00:37.390> do<00:00:37.990> it<00:00:38.140> while<00:00:38.320> it's<00:00:38.500> on<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.710> gun<00:00:38.950> that's

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
still do it while it's on the gun that's

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.160 
still do it while it's on the gun that's
the<00:00:39.340> whole<00:00:39.490> purpose<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.090> video<00:00:40.390> what<00:00:41.140> I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
the whole purpose of the video what I

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.960 
the whole purpose of the video what I
want<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:41.620> get<00:00:42.070> understanding<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.760> how<00:00:42.910> it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
want you to get understanding of how it

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.510 
want you to get understanding of how it
works<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.320> while<00:00:44.560> it's<00:00:44.740> still<00:00:45.010> on<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:45.250> trigger

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
works so while it's still on the trigger

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.290 
works so while it's still on the trigger
guard<00:00:45.760> you<00:00:46.180> can<00:00:46.210> get<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.660> off<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.610> we<00:00:48.760> get<00:00:49.000> get

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
guard you can get it off so we get get

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.980 
guard you can get it off so we get get
you<00:00:49.450> a<00:00:49.480> screwdriver<00:00:49.930> no<00:00:50.500> bigger<00:00:50.800> than<00:00:51.100> this

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
you a screwdriver no bigger than this

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.670 
you a screwdriver no bigger than this
about<00:00:52.990> 3/16<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.100> an<00:00:54.400> inch<00:00:54.520> wide<00:00:55.560> stick<00:00:56.560> it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
about 3/16 of an inch wide stick it

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.410 
about 3/16 of an inch wide stick it
through<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.950> trigger<00:00:57.370> guard<00:00:57.640> get<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.240> down

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
through the trigger guard get it down

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.630 
through the trigger guard get it down
there<00:00:59.640> where<00:01:00.640> this<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.690> going<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.640> disengage

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
there where this is going to disengage

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.300 
there where this is going to disengage
that<00:01:04.360> lock

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.310 
that lock

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.710 
that lock
remember<00:01:06.310> it's<00:01:06.490> spring-loaded<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:09.480> just<00:01:10.480> get

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
remember it's spring-loaded so just get

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.940 
remember it's spring-loaded so just get
it<00:01:10.840> down<00:01:11.020> there<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.350> get<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.770> off<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.580 
it down there and get it off the
tumblers<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.750> might<00:01:19.930> be<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.080> little<00:01:20.290> bit<00:01:20.380> better

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
tumblers it might be a little bit better

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
tumblers it might be a little bit better
view<00:01:21.040> for<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.520> there<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:23.500> see<00:01:23.530> up<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.190> there

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
getting your screwdriver ran through the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.730 
getting your screwdriver ran through the
trigger<00:01:51.729> guard<00:01:52.000> -<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.900> about<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.380> point

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
trigger guard - just about this point

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.640 
trigger guard - just about this point
and<00:01:53.950> pushing<00:01:54.880> back<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.990> will<00:01:56.200> release

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
and pushing back and that will release

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.149 
and pushing back and that will release
the<00:01:56.680> tumbler<00:01:58.080> if<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.170> can<00:01:59.350> see<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.710> movement

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
the tumbler if you can see the movement

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.179 
the tumbler if you can see the movement
or<00:02:00.250> not<00:02:00.430> but<00:02:00.580> that's<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.240> just<00:02:02.189> push

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.350 

and<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:13.030> will<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:14.080> trigger<00:02:14.970> lock<00:02:15.970> off

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and that will get your trigger lock off

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.260 
and that will get your trigger lock off
your<00:02:16.720> firearm<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.560> lost<00:02:17.800> your<00:02:18.040> keys<00:02:18.310> or

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
gun that has one on there and the owner

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590
