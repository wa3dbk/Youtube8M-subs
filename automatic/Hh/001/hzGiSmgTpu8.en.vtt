gradient<00:05:36.260> overlay<00:05:36.320> on<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.919> put<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.550> on<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:38.000> soft

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
gradient overlay on it put it on to soft

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:50.820 
gradient overlay on it put it on to soft
light<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:41.169> just<00:05:45.099> wrong<00:05:46.099> there<00:05:49.330> pick<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.479> from

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
light and just wrong there pick it from

light and just wrong there pick it from
the<00:05:51.830> onion<00:05:52.760> just<00:05:53.270> change<00:05:53.479> that<00:05:53.539> one<00:05:53.720> too<00:05:53.780> black

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
the onion just change that one too black

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.899 
the onion just change that one too black
to<00:05:54.020> gradient<00:05:54.530> or<00:05:54.740> you<00:05:55.370> can<00:05:55.550> have<00:05:55.669> a<00:05:55.699> light

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
to gradient or you can have a light

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.719 
to gradient or you can have a light
phone<00:05:56.090> white<00:05:56.349> however<00:05:57.349> you<00:05:57.500> want<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.740> just

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
phone white however you want it just

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.550 
phone white however you want it just
gonna<00:05:58.909> have<00:05:59.030> mine<00:05:59.270> on<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.720> little<00:06:00.110> bit<00:06:00.229> from

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
gonna have mine on a little bit from

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.680 
gonna have mine on a little bit from
grey<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.810> make<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:03.080> look<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.680> lot<00:06:04.300> make<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.510> look

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
grey to make it look a lot make it look

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.379 
grey to make it look a lot make it look
more<00:06:06.970> darker<00:06:09.580> so<00:06:10.580> I<00:06:10.610> hon<00:06:10.880> explain<00:06:11.240> myself

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
more darker so I hon explain myself

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.879 
more darker so I hon explain myself
properly<00:06:11.840> dividers<00:06:12.409> really<00:06:13.220> bad<00:06:13.370> float<00:06:15.430> and

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
properly dividers really bad float and

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.339 
properly dividers really bad float and
sometimes<00:06:18.889> you<00:06:19.190> want<00:06:19.340> to<00:06:19.430> just<00:06:19.669> put<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:21.080> in

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
sometimes you want to just put you in

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:28.149 
sometimes you want to just put you in
then<00:06:22.010> on<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.610> give<00:06:22.789> it<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:22.970> nice<00:06:24.880> and<00:06:26.949> change<00:06:27.949> it

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
then on to give it a nice and change it

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.700 
then on to give it a nice and change it
to<00:06:28.190> a<00:06:28.400> white

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:43.220 

a<00:06:35.060> new<00:06:36.060> layer<00:06:38.060> merge<00:06:39.060> those<00:06:41.090> x-rays<00:06:42.090> 100%<00:06:43.020> you

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
a new layer merge those x-rays 100% you

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.310 
a new layer merge those x-rays 100% you
can<00:06:43.410> see<00:06:43.620> what<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:44.010> changes<00:06:44.520> I've<00:06:44.730> done<00:06:45.320> if

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
can see what the changes I've done if

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.980 
can see what the changes I've done if
you<00:06:46.530> go<00:06:46.680> on<00:06:46.740> this<00:06:46.950> layer<00:06:48.410> right<00:06:49.410> all<00:06:49.800> right<00:06:50.990> you

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
you go on this layer right all right you

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.200 
you go on this layer right all right you
can<00:06:52.050> see<00:06:52.680> what<00:06:53.190> you<00:06:53.460> just<00:06:53.520> make<00:06:53.760> that<00:06:53.790> big<00:06:54.060> it<00:06:54.180> a

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
can see what you just make that big it a

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.860 
can see what you just make that big it a
bit<00:06:54.620> toxic<00:06:56.270> slow<00:06:57.270> it<00:06:57.450> up<00:06:57.570> and<00:06:58.250> just<00:06:59.690> you<00:07:00.690> can

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
bit toxic slow it up and just you can

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.640 
bit toxic slow it up and just you can
see<00:07:01.080> there's<00:07:02.270> less<00:07:04.640> dawns<00:07:05.640> on<00:07:05.880> the<00:07:06.000> bottom

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
see there's less dawns on the bottom

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.420 
see there's less dawns on the bottom
it's<00:07:07.650> not<00:07:08.040> line<00:07:08.640> property<00:07:09.120> in<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.390> tenth<00:07:10.430> the

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
it's not line property in the tenth the

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.490 
it's not line property in the tenth the
depth<00:07:11.940> of<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.330> it<00:07:12.510> looks<00:07:13.260> just<00:07:14.220> like<00:07:14.880> unedited

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
depth of it it looks just like unedited

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.470 
depth of it it looks just like unedited
unedited<00:07:16.500> so<00:07:17.490> if<00:07:17.550> you<00:07:17.670> come<00:07:17.820> on<00:07:17.970> here<00:07:18.210> you<00:07:18.240> can

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
unedited so if you come on here you can

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.660 
unedited so if you come on here you can
see<00:07:18.720> there's<00:07:18.960> a<00:07:19.250> lot<00:07:20.250> more<00:07:22.130> so<00:07:23.130> if<00:07:23.190> it's<00:07:23.430> a<00:07:23.520> bit

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
see there's a lot more so if it's a bit

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.530 
see there's a lot more so if it's a bit
sketchy<00:07:24.540> it's<00:07:24.720> just<00:07:24.930> I'm<00:07:25.260> on<00:07:25.470> 200<00:07:26.130> sir<00:07:26.420> so<00:07:27.420> you

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
sketchy it's just I'm on 200 sir so you

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.820 
sketchy it's just I'm on 200 sir so you
can<00:07:27.630> see<00:07:27.810> there's<00:07:28.020> more<00:07:28.050> debt<00:07:28.500> from<00:07:28.710> the

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
can see there's more debt from the

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.390 
can see there's more debt from the
bottom<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.810> between<00:07:30.810> then<00:07:31.200> where<00:07:31.770> that<00:07:32.160> you

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
bottom and between then where that you

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.100 
bottom and between then where that you
can<00:07:32.550> see<00:07:32.760> them<00:07:33.000> will<00:07:33.840> shape<00:07:34.110> the<00:07:34.140> way<00:07:34.440> in<00:07:36.110> go

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
can see them will shape the way in go

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.540 
can see them will shape the way in go
back<00:07:37.290> to<00:07:37.380> 100<00:07:37.770> you<00:07:38.010> can<00:07:38.130> see<00:07:38.280> there's<00:07:38.490> more

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.550 
back to 100 you can see there's more

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.770 
back to 100 you can see there's more
color<00:07:39.110> there's<00:07:40.110> more<00:07:40.380> reflection<00:07:40.980> on<00:07:41.100> it<00:07:41.250> and

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
color there's more reflection on it and

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.690 
color there's more reflection on it and
it<00:07:42.780> just<00:07:42.810> looks<00:07:43.170> nicer<00:07:44.270> to<00:07:45.270> in<00:07:45.420> my<00:07:45.630> opinion

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700 
it just looks nicer to in my opinion

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.790 
it just looks nicer to in my opinion
this<00:07:47.700> is<00:07:47.760> my<00:07:48.240> first<00:07:48.510> tutorial<00:07:49.110> on<00:07:49.680> this

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.230 
channel and trying to expand it I've got

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.960
