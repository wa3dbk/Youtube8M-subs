see<00:03:17.140> now<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.770> was<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:19.330> installed<00:03:19.600> on

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
see now this was I just installed on

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.830 
see now this was I just installed on
this<00:03:19.900> system<00:03:20.110> on<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.650> ordinarily<00:03:21.840> you

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
this system on it so ordinarily you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.150 
this system on it so ordinarily you
probably<00:03:23.080> wouldn't<00:03:23.290> be<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.410> top<00:03:23.650> pane<00:03:23.920> it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
probably wouldn't be the top pane it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.500 
probably wouldn't be the top pane it
will<00:03:24.250> probably<00:03:24.370> be<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.670> bottom<00:03:25.030> right<00:03:25.209> but

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
will probably be in the bottom right but

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.640 
will probably be in the bottom right but
you<00:03:25.630> know<00:03:25.720> other<00:03:25.840> programs<00:03:26.230> UX<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.500> have

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
you know other programs UX I have

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
installed so most like it's going to be

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.009 
installed so most like it's going to be
down<00:03:27.970> here<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.390> you're<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:28.540> going<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> pretty
