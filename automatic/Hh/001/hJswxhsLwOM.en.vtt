00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
white background so it's a little bit

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.069

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it shouldn't wrap anymore we can also

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.539

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
little bit and let's change the color so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.459 
little bit and let's change the color so
we'll<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.689> change<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.290> blue<00:01:55.920> okay<00:01:57.469> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
we'll just change it to blue okay so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
we'll just change it to blue okay so
feel<00:01:58.710> free<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.920> style<00:01:59.189> your<00:01:59.340> text<00:01:59.490> however<00:01:59.759> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
feel free to style your text however you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.959 
feel free to style your text however you
wish<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.810> matches<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.229> site<00:02:01.969> let's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
wish so that it matches your site let's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.179 
wish so that it matches your site let's
look<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> rest<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> options<00:02:03.990> here

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
look at the rest of the options here

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.289 
look at the rest of the options here
okay<00:02:05.189> let<00:02:05.399> me<00:02:05.490> shrink<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.270> have

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
okay let me shrink that a bit so we have

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.650 
okay let me shrink that a bit so we have
more<00:02:06.509> room<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.459> okay<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.239> options

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
more room to see okay so in our options

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270 
more room to see okay so in our options
flyout<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> next<00:02:10.500> thing<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> select

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
flyout the next thing we have to select

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
flyout the next thing we have to select
is<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> says<00:02:11.790> animation<00:02:12.510> type<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.170> Brad

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
is it says animation type and in Brad

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
is it says animation type and in Brad
it's<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.830> I'll<00:02:14.730> explain<00:02:15.090> why<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.360> says<00:02:15.690> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it's in I'll explain why it says in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.960 
it's in I'll explain why it says in
later<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:16.590> basically<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.340> set<00:02:17.670> two

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
later but basically you can set two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.430 
later but basically you can set two
different<00:02:18.330> types<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.660> animations<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
different types of animations for a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.230 
different types of animations for a
single<00:02:19.740> block<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.040> text<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:21.180> we

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
single block of text so right now we

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.410 
single block of text so right now we
have<00:02:21.330> fly<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:22.920> but<00:02:23.730> let's<00:02:24.240> do

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
have fly in and up but let's do

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.870 
have fly in and up but let's do
something<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.709> saw<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.670> coding

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
something like we saw on the coding

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.760 
something like we saw on the coding
night<00:02:27.120> site<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.810> was<00:02:27.990> actually<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.380> fade

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
night site and that was actually a fade

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.140 
night site and that was actually a fade
in<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.120> select<00:02:30.300> fade<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
in so if I select fade in it's going to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
in so if I select fade in it's going to
regenerate<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.660> preview<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:34.709> can<00:02:35.100> set

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
regenerate a preview and now we can set

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.970 
regenerate a preview and now we can set
some<00:02:35.580> timing<00:02:35.910> options<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> delay

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
some timing options so we have a delay

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.920 
some timing options so we have a delay
time<00:02:38.280> before<00:02:38.640> playing<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.450> majority<00:02:39.870> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
time before playing the majority of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.780 
time before playing the majority of
users<00:02:40.230> are<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> want<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.250> set<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.580> at

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
users are going to want to set this at

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.430 
users are going to want to set this at
zero<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.510> means<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> play

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
zero that means it's just going to play

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.370 
zero that means it's just going to play
instantly<00:02:44.270> we<00:02:45.270> have<00:02:45.300> an<00:02:45.510> animation<00:02:45.870> time<00:02:46.200> for

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
instantly we have an animation time for

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.650 
instantly we have an animation time for
each<00:02:46.530> character<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.459> basically<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.209> is<00:02:48.450> how

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
each character so basically this is how

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
each character so basically this is how
long<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.050> single<00:02:49.470> character<00:02:49.920> takes<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.340> appear

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
long a single character takes to appear

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.030 
long a single character takes to appear
and<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.180> next<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:51.600> below<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.260> delay<00:02:52.709> time

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and the next one below is the delay time

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
and the next one below is the delay time
between<00:02:53.310> characters<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.300> amount<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.540> time

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
between characters so the amount of time

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.770 
between characters so the amount of time
before<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.800> next<00:02:55.920> character<00:02:56.459> comes<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.940> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
before your next character comes up so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.479 
before your next character comes up so
in<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.080> example<00:02:58.230> let's<00:02:58.739> set<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> animation

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
in this example let's set the animation

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
in this example let's set the animation
time<00:02:59.670> for<00:02:59.850> each<00:02:59.910> character<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.510> say<00:03:00.720> 30<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
time for each character to say 30 and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.800 
time for each character to say 30 and
this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.760> milliseconds<00:03:04.100> okay<00:03:05.390> now<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this is in milliseconds okay now the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.259 
this is in milliseconds okay now the
last<00:03:06.840> few<00:03:07.319> checkboxes<00:03:07.830> we<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.790> we

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
last few checkboxes we have here is we

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.030 
last few checkboxes we have here is we
can<00:03:09.450> come<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:09.989> at<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.200> random<00:03:10.470> character

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
can come in at a random character

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.949 
can come in at a random character
sequence<00:03:11.519> which<00:03:11.910> means<00:03:12.209> rather<00:03:12.450> than<00:03:12.569> it's

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
sequence which means rather than it's

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.650 
sequence which means rather than it's
starting<00:03:13.440> from<00:03:13.560> left<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.280> going

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
starting from left to right and going

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.330 
starting from left to right and going
MUSC<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:15.900> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> come<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.440> all<00:03:16.739> randomly

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
MUSC it's going to come in all randomly

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.880 
MUSC it's going to come in all randomly
we<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.420> also<00:03:18.570> animate<00:03:19.079> all<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.500> characters

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
we can also animate all the characters

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.280 
we can also animate all the characters
at<00:03:20.040> once<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.579> come<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.910> at<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.660> time<00:03:21.989> and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
at once so they come in at one time and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.949 
at once so they come in at one time and
in<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.340> final<00:03:23.670> check<00:03:23.850> box<00:03:24.090> says<00:03:24.540> loop

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
in this final check box says loop

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.620 
in this final check box says loop
animation<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.890> right<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.000> checked<00:03:27.329> and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
animation and right now it's checked and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.569 
animation and right now it's checked and
what<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.140> does<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.590> enables<00:03:28.890> this<00:03:29.340> kind

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
what that does is it enables this kind

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.699 
what that does is it enables this kind
of<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.790> second<00:03:30.209> half<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.810> box<00:03:31.140> which<00:03:31.470> is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
of the second half of this box which is

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.310 
of the second half of this box which is
the<00:03:31.920> out<00:03:32.150> animation<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.299> your<00:03:33.810> animation<00:03:34.230> is

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
the out animation if your animation is

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.900 
the out animation if your animation is
looping<00:03:34.680> obviously<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.250> needs<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.549> come<00:03:35.730> in

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
looping obviously it needs to come in

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
looping obviously it needs to come in
and<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.390> needs<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.660> come<00:03:36.810> out<00:03:36.959> somehow<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.680> this

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and it needs to come out somehow so this

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.590 
and it needs to come out somehow so this
just<00:03:38.040> allows<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.549> control<00:03:38.940> for<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.390> for

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
just allows that control for the for

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000 
just allows that control for the for
this<00:03:39.690> example<00:03:40.019> I'm<00:03:40.350> just<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.709> turn<00:03:40.860> this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
this example I'm just going to turn this

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.740 
this example I'm just going to turn this
off<00:03:41.160> for<00:03:41.220> now<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.510> when<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> do

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
off for now and you can see when I do

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.860 
off for now and you can see when I do
that<00:03:43.019> all<00:03:43.230> these<00:03:43.530> controls<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.310> away<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
that all these controls go away and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.150 
that all these controls go away and
let's<00:03:45.870> preview<00:03:46.019> how<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.440> looks<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.829> again

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
let's preview how this looks so again

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.759 
let's preview how this looks so again
we're<00:03:47.280> going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.670> fade<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.530> we're<00:03:49.530> going

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
we're going to see a fade in we're going

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.199 
we're going to see a fade in we're going
to<00:03:49.859> see<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> little<00:03:50.250> bit<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.609> delay<00:03:50.910> or<00:03:50.940> an

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
to see a little bit of a delay or an

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.849 
to see a little bit of a delay or an
animation<00:03:51.690> time<00:03:52.049> for<00:03:52.230> each<00:03:52.320> character<00:03:52.739> that's

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
animation time for each character that's

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.710 
animation time for each character that's
a<00:03:52.980> little<00:03:53.160> slower<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.640> let's<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:54.570> how<00:03:54.630> it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
a little slower and let's see how it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.930 
a little slower and let's see how it
looks<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:56.400> preview<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
looks so if we preview that in the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.660 
looks so if we preview that in the
browser<00:03:57.560> there<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.890> come<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.190> one<00:03:59.370> at<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.519> time

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
browser there they come in one at a time

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.910 
browser there they come in one at a time
just<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.230> now<00:04:01.230> use<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.739> widget

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
just like that now use this widget

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.580 
just like that now use this widget
subtly<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.970> should<00:04:03.239> be<00:04:03.359> elegant<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.049> you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
subtly it should be elegant and you

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.259 
subtly it should be elegant and you
don't<00:04:04.769> want<00:04:04.950> everything<00:04:05.519> flying<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
don't want everything flying in and

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.640 
don't want everything flying in and
coming<00:04:06.420> in<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:06.690> different<00:04:06.810> times<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.590> think

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
coming in at different times but I think

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.860 
coming in at different times but I think
that<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.430> pretty<00:04:08.549> nice<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.209> let's<00:04:09.750> go

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
that that was pretty nice so let's go

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020 
that that was pretty nice so let's go
back<00:04:09.900> into<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.709> let's<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.579> select<00:04:11.760> this

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
back into it and let's just select this

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.210 
back into it and let's just select this
random<00:04:12.540> character<00:04:12.959> sequence<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:13.739> example

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
random character sequence for example

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.880 
random character sequence for example
and<00:04:14.630> then<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:15.660> know<00:04:16.019> what<00:04:16.169> let's<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.470> turn

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and then you know what let's just turn

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.409 
and then you know what let's just turn
down<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.430> animation<00:04:17.820> time<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.329> each

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
down the animation time for each

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.509 
down the animation time for each
character<00:04:18.720> back<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.229> ten<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:20.310> want<00:04:20.459> to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
character back to ten and I want to

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.860 
character back to ten and I want to
preview<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.850> again<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.299> browser<00:04:21.510> you

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
preview that again in the browser you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.060 
preview that again in the browser you
don't<00:04:22.019> actually<00:04:22.140> need<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> publish<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.890> up

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
don't actually need to publish this up

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.140 
don't actually need to publish this up
you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.370> preview<00:04:23.789> it<00:04:23.849> right<00:04:23.909> in<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
you can just preview it right in the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.110 
you can just preview it right in the
browser<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.539> it<00:04:24.659> run

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
browser and it run

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.180 
browser and it run
so<00:04:25.720> there<00:04:25.960> now<00:04:26.199> that<00:04:26.290> we<00:04:26.470> did<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.070> can

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
so there now that we did that you can

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.189 
so there now that we did that you can
see<00:04:27.370> how<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.639> came<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.030> all<00:04:28.240> in<00:04:28.660> random

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
see how it came in all in random

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.230 
see how it came in all in random
characters<00:04:29.650> random<00:04:30.160> locations<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:31.090> that's

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
characters random locations so that's

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.060 
characters random locations so that's
cool

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
cool

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.830 
cool
okay<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.130> let's<00:04:33.910> now<00:04:34.150> look<00:04:34.389> at<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.660> out

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
okay so let's now look at the out

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.230 
okay so let's now look at the out
animation<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.100> let's<00:04:36.580> say<00:04:36.699> we're<00:04:36.850> happy<00:04:37.030> with

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
animation so let's say we're happy with

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.670 
animation so let's say we're happy with
the<00:04:37.389> fade<00:04:37.600> in<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.050> we're<00:04:38.169> using<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.620> it

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the fade in that we're using for it

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.400 
the fade in that we're using for it
coming<00:04:38.919> in<00:04:39.070> now<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:39.729> we<00:04:39.850> click<00:04:40.000> loop<00:04:40.360> then<00:04:41.320> we

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
coming in now if we click loop then we

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.990 
coming in now if we click loop then we
need<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.710> figure<00:04:41.860> out<00:04:42.010> how<00:04:42.280> we<00:04:42.340> want<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.790> to

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
need to figure out how we want this to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.469 
need to figure out how we want this to
leave<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:45.160> we<00:04:45.340> have<00:04:45.550> another<00:04:45.970> or<00:04:46.360> another

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
leave and so we have another or another

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.450 
leave and so we have another or another
drop<00:04:46.960> down<00:04:47.169> here<00:04:47.470> with<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> bunch<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.100> looping

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
drop down here with a bunch of looping

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.790 
drop down here with a bunch of looping
options<00:04:48.639> or<00:04:49.000> out<00:04:49.180> options<00:04:49.720> but<00:04:49.900> let's<00:04:50.500> select

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
options or out options but let's select

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.080 
options or out options but let's select
something<00:04:51.040> really<00:04:51.460> crazy<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:51.970> you're

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
something really crazy that you're

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.520 
something really crazy that you're
probably<00:04:52.300> not<00:04:52.540> going<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:52.990> use<00:04:53.110> very<00:04:53.350> much

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
probably not going to use very much

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.150 
probably not going to use very much
let's<00:04:53.800> say<00:04:53.949> fly<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.850> down<00:04:55.949> you'll<00:04:56.949> see

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
let's say fly out and down you'll see

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.650 
let's say fly out and down you'll see
what<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:57.460> does<00:04:57.729> when<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:58.000> preview<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.510> but

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
what that does when I preview it but

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.570 
what that does when I preview it but
it's<00:04:58.780> pretty<00:04:58.930> intense<00:04:59.350> and<00:05:00.160> then<00:05:00.280> we<00:05:00.400> have

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
it's pretty intense and then we have

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.520 
it's pretty intense and then we have
also<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.970> same<00:05:01.270> kind<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.630> timing<00:05:01.900> controls

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
also the same kind of timing controls

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.960 
also the same kind of timing controls
here<00:05:02.830> we<00:05:02.950> have<00:05:03.040> an<00:05:03.130> exit<00:05:03.490> time<00:05:03.639> for<00:05:03.880> each

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
here we have an exit time for each

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.350 
here we have an exit time for each
character<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.690> delay<00:05:05.440> time<00:05:05.800> we<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.790> exit<00:05:07.240> in

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
character a delay time we can exit in

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.120 
character a delay time we can exit in
random<00:05:07.690> sequence<00:05:08.080> or<00:05:08.320> we<00:05:08.410> can<00:05:08.530> exit<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:09.010> at

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
random sequence or we can exit all at

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.350 
random sequence or we can exit all at
once<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.760> I'm<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.030> leave<00:05:10.150> those

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
once so I'm going to leave those

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.150 
once so I'm going to leave those
unchecked<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.260> what<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.500> means<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.860> should

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
unchecked so what it means it should

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.370 
unchecked so what it means it should
exit<00:05:12.729> basically<00:05:13.270> from<00:05:13.510> left<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.930> right<00:05:14.139> so

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
exit basically from left to right so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.990 
exit basically from left to right so
let's<00:05:15.070> just<00:05:15.220> go<00:05:15.310> ahead<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.520> preview<00:05:15.729> that<00:05:15.850> in

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
let's just go ahead and preview that in

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.700 
let's just go ahead and preview that in
the<00:05:16.090> browser<00:05:18.090> okay<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.450> fades<00:05:19.780> in<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.229> then

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
the browser okay so it fades in and then

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.710 
the browser okay so it fades in and then
our<00:05:20.979> exit<00:05:21.340> animation<00:05:21.729> comes<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.120> so<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.479> drop

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
our exit animation comes in so they drop

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.140 
our exit animation comes in so they drop
out<00:05:22.900> from<00:05:23.199> left<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.470> right<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:24.030> because<00:05:25.030> it

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
out from left to right and because it

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.969 
out from left to right and because it
sets<00:05:25.360> loop<00:05:25.570> just<00:05:26.020> going<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.289> continue<00:05:26.500> doing

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
sets loop just going to continue doing

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.150 
sets loop just going to continue doing
that<00:05:28.139> so<00:05:29.139> that's<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.530> that's<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.889> text

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
that so that's it that's the text

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.770 
that so that's it that's the text
animation<00:05:30.280> widget<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.210> encourage<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:31.690> to

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
animation widget so I encourage you to

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.390 
animation widget so I encourage you to
play<00:05:31.990> with<00:05:32.169> all<00:05:32.320> these<00:05:32.470> different<00:05:32.680> types<00:05:32.889> here

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
play with all these different types here

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.469 
play with all these different types here
if<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.580> set<00:05:33.850> this<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:35.130> let's<00:05:36.130> go<00:05:36.280> fade<00:05:36.729> actually

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
if I set this to let's go fade actually

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.510 
if I set this to let's go fade actually
let's<00:05:37.600> go<00:05:37.630> rotate<00:05:38.169> in<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:39.070> animation

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
let's go rotate in and the animation

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.640 
let's go rotate in and the animation
type<00:05:39.700> out<00:05:39.940> we'll<00:05:40.599> set<00:05:40.810> this<00:05:40.960> to<00:05:41.139> a<00:05:41.169> crazy<00:05:41.410> one

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
type out we'll set this to a crazy one

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.909 
type out we'll set this to a crazy one
which<00:05:41.830> is<00:05:42.070> called<00:05:42.639> hinge<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.710> I'm<00:05:44.710> going<00:05:44.889> to

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
which is called hinge and I'm going to

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.010 
which is called hinge and I'm going to
change<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.280> time<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.580> little<00:05:45.849> bit<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.660> be<00:05:46.810> nice

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
change the time a little bit to be nice

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.570 
change the time a little bit to be nice
and<00:05:47.200> slow<00:05:47.440> and<00:05:47.680> you'll<00:05:47.830> see<00:05:47.979> how<00:05:48.099> this<00:05:48.250> works

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
and slow and you'll see how this works

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.279 
and slow and you'll see how this works
and<00:05:48.970> we'll<00:05:49.630> go<00:05:49.750> a<00:05:49.780> random<00:05:50.169> sequence<00:05:50.349> why<00:05:50.740> not

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
and we'll go a random sequence why not

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.779 
and we'll go a random sequence why not
okay<00:05:53.289> let's<00:05:54.070> preview<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.430> in<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.610> browser

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
okay let's preview that in the browser

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.690 
okay let's preview that in the browser
and<00:05:56.160> so<00:05:57.160> we<00:05:57.340> have<00:05:57.520> a<00:05:57.550> rotation<00:05:58.030> in<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:59.639> now<00:06:00.639> the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
and so we have a rotation in and now the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.740 
and so we have a rotation in and now the
hinge<00:06:01.240> effect<00:06:01.900> happens<00:06:02.380> which<00:06:02.590> means<00:06:02.889> all<00:06:03.160> the

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
hinge effect happens which means all the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.330 
hinge effect happens which means all the
characters<00:06:04.750> actually<00:06:05.020> hinge<00:06:05.470> and<00:06:05.800> kind<00:06:06.310> of

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
characters actually hinge and kind of

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.330 
characters actually hinge and kind of
swings<00:06:06.639> left<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.210> drop<00:06:07.660> oh<00:06:07.889> so<00:06:08.889> that's<00:06:09.099> the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
swings left and drop oh so that's the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.640 
swings left and drop oh so that's the
widget<00:06:09.789> it's<00:06:09.970> pretty<00:06:10.330> extreme<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:11.380> took<00:06:11.500> lots

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
widget it's pretty extreme it took lots

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.469 
widget it's pretty extreme it took lots
of<00:06:11.830> code<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.280> do<00:06:12.400> this<00:06:12.550> but<00:06:12.820> keep<00:06:13.000> in<00:06:13.150> mind<00:06:13.180> this

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
of code to do this but keep in mind this

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.540 
of code to do this but keep in mind this
is<00:06:13.630> all<00:06:13.720> selectable<00:06:14.169> text<00:06:14.289> like<00:06:14.979> I<00:06:15.130> can<00:06:15.340> still

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
is all selectable text like I can still

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.010 
is all selectable text like I can still
select<00:06:15.700> these<00:06:16.000> even<00:06:16.389> as<00:06:16.510> they're<00:06:16.720> swinging

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
select these even as they're swinging

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.320 
select these even as they're swinging
and<00:06:17.289> dropping<00:06:17.530> out<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:17.830> this<00:06:18.550> has<00:06:18.760> no<00:06:19.060> negative

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
and dropping out so this has no negative

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.990 
and dropping out so this has no negative
effect<00:06:19.870> whatsoever<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.800> something<00:06:21.280> like<00:06:21.490> SEO

pretty light normally you would have had

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.260 
pretty light normally you would have had
to<00:06:28.810> do<00:06:28.990> this<00:06:29.169> with<00:06:29.229> flash<00:06:30.010> or<00:06:30.580> right<00:06:31.120> now

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
to do this with flash or right now

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.630 
to do this with flash or right now
people<00:06:31.479> are<00:06:31.660> doing<00:06:31.930> it<00:06:32.050> in<00:06:32.289> edge<00:06:32.620> but<00:06:33.099> even<00:06:33.490> I'm

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
people are doing it in edge but even I'm

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.760 
people are doing it in edge but even I'm
not<00:06:33.880> a<00:06:33.909> huge<00:06:34.419> edge<00:06:34.690> user<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:35.409> I<00:06:35.469> found<00:06:35.680> it

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
not a huge edge user and I found it

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.350 
not a huge edge user and I found it
really<00:06:35.860> difficult<00:06:36.130> to<00:06:36.400> do<00:06:36.610> so<00:06:36.940> this<00:06:37.120> will<00:06:37.270> let

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
really difficult to do so this will let

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.439 
really difficult to do so this will let
you<00:06:37.479> do<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.870> majority<00:06:38.020> of

you do the majority of
right<00:06:38.689> in<00:06:38.840> muse<00:06:39.139> and<00:06:39.819> you<00:06:40.819> know<00:06:40.939> it<00:06:41.090> doesn't

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
right in muse and you know it doesn't

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.580 
right in muse and you know it doesn't
affect<00:06:41.569> your<00:06:41.689> site<00:06:41.870> load<00:06:42.080> time<00:06:42.289> or<00:06:42.409> anything
