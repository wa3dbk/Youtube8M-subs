standard<00:00:39.270> l<00:00:39.420> handles<00:00:40.969> these<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.149> good<00:00:42.300> but

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
standard l handles these are good but

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
standard l handles these are good but
sometimes<00:00:43.500> you'll<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.640> like

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
sometimes you'll see when you're like

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.639 
sometimes you'll see when you're like
trying<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.210> torque<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.930> it'll<00:00:46.500> be

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
trying to get torque on them it'll be

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.229 
trying to get torque on them it'll be
hard<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> top<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> go

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
hard to do the top end so you have to go

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
hard to do the top end so you have to go
to<00:00:48.329> bottom<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.050> risk<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
to bottom and then you risk with the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
to bottom and then you risk with the
occurs<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.239> stuff<00:00:51.539> risk<00:00:51.899> scratching<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
occurs and stuff risk scratching the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.779 
occurs and stuff risk scratching the
body<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> decided<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:55.039> should<00:00:56.039> invest<00:00:56.489> in

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
body so I decided I should invest in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.070 
body so I decided I should invest in
some<00:00:57.559> better<00:00:59.270> suited<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:01.039> motorcycles<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:03.080> no

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
some better suited for motorcycles so no

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
some better suited for motorcycles so no
longer<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.530> am<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> using<00:01:05.430> these

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
longer or am I going to be using these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
longer or am I going to be using these
although<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:08.520> good

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790

metric<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> seventh<00:01:54.420> standard<00:01:54.570> would

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
metric in the seventh standard would

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.100 
metric in the seventh standard would
have<00:01:55.049> been<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.350> 80<00:01:56.280> bucks<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.479> found

have been like 80 bucks and I found

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
have been like 80 bucks and I found
these<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.710> Sears<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.820> under<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.689> 25

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
these in Sears right under them for 25

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
these in Sears right under them for 25
bucks<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.930> like

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bucks for all of them so it's like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.499 
bucks for all of them so it's like
almost<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.520> than<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.700> fourth<00:02:06.329> of

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
almost a little more than a fourth of

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.320 
almost a little more than a fourth of
the<00:02:06.570> price<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the price so a lot of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.180 
the price so a lot of
budget<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.780> mean<00:02:10.020> eventually<00:02:10.619> i'll<00:02:10.979> probably

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
budget I mean eventually i'll probably

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.950 
budget I mean eventually i'll probably
buy<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> craftsman<00:02:12.150> ones<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:12.570> I'm<00:02:12.660> older

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
buy the craftsman ones when I'm older

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.370 
buy the craftsman ones when I'm older

in strapped together like this and
there's<00:02:25.620> two<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.830> them<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.370> held<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> metric

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
there's two of them one held the metric

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.110 
there's two of them one held the metric
you<00:02:28.590> see<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.480> open<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.570> up<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:32.120> that's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you see you just open it up and that's

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.430 
you see you just open it up and that's
where<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:33.480> laid<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.320> have

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
where they laid in so if you don't have

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280 
where they laid in so if you don't have
a<00:02:34.530> tool<00:02:34.770> chest<00:02:35.100> or<00:02:35.250> anything<00:02:35.580> that's<00:02:36.450> that's

a tool chest or anything that's that's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.720 
a tool chest or anything that's that's
the<00:02:37.410> way<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.770> keep<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.100> stored<00:02:38.460> as<00:02:38.610> in

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the way you can keep them stored as in

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
the way you can keep them stored as in
the<00:02:38.850> original<00:02:38.910> packaging<00:02:41.960> but<00:02:42.960> i<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.110> have

so<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.640> bolt<00:03:44.880> right<00:03:45.060> here<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.900> five<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.100> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
so this bolt right here the five so I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.570 
so this bolt right here the five so I
got<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.459> 500<00:03:48.150> right<00:03:48.480> here<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.050> then<00:03:49.920> see<00:03:50.430> how

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
got the 500 right here and then see how

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.110 
got the 500 right here and then see how
far<00:03:51.390> away<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.840> from<00:03:52.140> body<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:54.000> can

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
far away it is from body and you can

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.530 
far away it is from body and you can
just<00:03:54.269> easily<00:03:54.690> crack<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.650> open<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.970> other<00:03:57.120> ones

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
just easily crack it open the other ones

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.110 
just easily crack it open the other ones
like<00:03:57.840> i<00:03:57.959> was<00:03:58.080> saying<00:03:58.320> they're<00:03:59.190> more<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.730> this

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
like i was saying they're more like this

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.030 
like i was saying they're more like this
and<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.540> see<00:04:00.750> right<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:01.140> already<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.920> is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
and you see right here already this is

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.250 
and you see right here already this is
bigger<00:04:02.280> than<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.239> l<00:04:03.390> would<00:04:03.600> be<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> five

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
bigger than the l would be on the five

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.710 
bigger than the l would be on the five
and<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:05.100> already<00:04:05.400> touching<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.269> body<00:04:06.450> right

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
and it's already touching the body right

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.170 
and it's already touching the body right
here<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:07.799> why<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:07.980> figured<00:04:08.340> t-handles

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
here so that's why I figured t-handles

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.030 
here so that's why I figured t-handles
give<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.420> some<00:04:09.630> distance<00:04:10.140> away<00:04:10.320> from<00:04:10.560> body

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
give you some distance away from body

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.509 
give you some distance away from body
work<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.180> don't<00:04:12.330> scratch<00:04:12.450> anything

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
work so you don't scratch anything

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.590 
work so you don't scratch anything
accidentally<00:04:14.519> by<00:04:14.700> trying<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> remove<00:04:15.299> some<00:04:15.570> of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
accidentally by trying to remove some of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.680 
accidentally by trying to remove some of
the<00:04:15.690> fairings<00:04:16.250> am<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.430> pretty<00:04:17.640> sure<00:04:17.910> there's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the fairings am I pretty sure there's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.670 
the fairings am I pretty sure there's
not

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
not

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.400 
not
our<00:04:20.340> bolt<00:04:20.699> on<00:04:20.940> here<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.630> wouldn't<00:04:21.870> be<00:04:24.410> that

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
our bolt on here that wouldn't be that

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.680 
our bolt on here that wouldn't be that
you<00:04:25.530> could<00:04:25.740> not<00:04:25.949> use<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.400> set<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.789> there

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
you could not use this set on there

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.860 
you could not use this set on there
pretty<00:04:27.840> much<00:04:27.960> has<00:04:28.800> two<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.280> half<00:04:29.870> three

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
pretty much has two and a half three

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.879 
pretty much has two and a half three
four<00:04:33.020> five<00:04:34.020> six<00:04:35.330> eight<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.570> ten<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.590> I'm

covered there I don't think really you
standard<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.210> bikes<00:04:42.810> they're<00:04:43.199> pretty<00:04:43.350> much

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
standard on bikes they're pretty much
