anyhow<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> had<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.609> four

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
anyhow so what I did was I had got four

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
anyhow so what I did was I had got four
of<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.390> containers<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> move<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
of these containers I'm going to move it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.330 
of these containers I'm going to move it
without<00:01:04.860> messing<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.580> anything<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:07.010> have<00:01:08.010> four

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
without messing up anything I have four

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.530 
without messing up anything I have four
black<00:01:09.150> containers<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> filled<00:01:10.680> with

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
black containers here that I filled with

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
black containers here that I filled with
soil<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:14.869> some<00:01:15.869> compost<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:19.430> have<00:01:20.430> holes

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
soil and some compost and I have holes

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
soil and some compost and I have holes
in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> bottom<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
in the bottom of it so that way the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.330 
in the bottom of it so that way the
water<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.880> always<00:01:24.180> keep<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> roots<00:01:25.979> wet

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
water can always keep the roots wet

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330 
water can always keep the roots wet
which<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.970> watercress<00:01:27.540> loves<00:01:28.340> because

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
which is what watercress loves because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
which is what watercress loves because
you<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.479> grow<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you can't just really grow it in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.170 
you can't just really grow it in the
dirt<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> doesn't<00:01:31.860> produce<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.909> likes

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
dirt or it doesn't produce it likes

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.890 
dirt or it doesn't produce it likes
water<00:01:34.070> hence<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> name<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.509> doesn't<00:01:36.780> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
water hence the name but it doesn't like

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
water hence the name but it doesn't like
stagnant<00:01:37.439> water<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> likes<00:01:38.009> moving<00:01:38.430> water<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
stagnant water it likes moving water so

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
stagnant water it likes moving water so
what<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:41.450> bought<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.409> fish

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.530 
though it suits me I know how hate it
but<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:48.550> hopefully<00:02:49.550> what<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.210> do

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
but and hopefully what it's going to do

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.930 
but and hopefully what it's going to do
if<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.290> keep<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.830> water<00:02:52.040> level<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.520> way<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.820> is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
if I keep the water level the way it is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.620 
if I keep the water level the way it is
so<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.330> not<00:02:53.590> over<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.740> plant<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.390> roots

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
so it's not over the plant the roots

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.680 
so it's not over the plant the roots
were<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:56.960> probably<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.220> long<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.850> then<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
were like probably this long and then I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.100 
were like probably this long and then I
put<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> soil<00:03:00.860> down<00:03:01.040> first<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.580> then<00:03:01.670> I

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
put the soil down first and then I

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.270 
put the soil down first and then I
pushed<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.320> down<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.740> really<00:03:03.890> compact

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
pushed it down so it's really compact

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.180 
pushed it down so it's really compact
then<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> put<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.680> watercress<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> roots

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
then I put the watercress in the roots

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.740 
then I put the watercress in the roots
and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:07.520> filled<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.030> with<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.209> layer<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.600> dirt

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
and then filled it with a layer of dirt

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.460 
and then filled it with a layer of dirt
on<00:03:08.930> top<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.959> filled<00:03:11.959> my<00:03:12.680> container<00:03:13.480> all<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
on top and filled my container all the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.729 
on top and filled my container all the
way<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.950> top<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.050> other<00:03:18.050> container<00:03:18.650> I

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
way to the top of the other container I

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.190 
way to the top of the other container I
have<00:03:18.980> inside<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.489> holding<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> dirt<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
have inside that's holding the dirt and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.170 
have inside that's holding the dirt and
then<00:03:21.560> around<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.070> course<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.430> just<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.880> put

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
then around it of course is just I put

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.440 
then around it of course is just I put
spring<00:03:23.540> water<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.940> then<00:03:25.940> I'm<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.270> add<00:03:26.420> a
