00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
everything when they put him in there

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.650 
everything when they put him in there
and<00:03:33.500> what<00:03:34.430> why<00:03:34.760> would<00:03:34.850> they<00:03:35.060> just<00:03:35.090> leave<00:03:35.630> a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
dead body in the cell I mean I guess

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.100

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
this is a torture chamber so I guess

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.050

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
threw his dead body back in the cell I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.210 
threw his dead body back in the cell I
mean<00:03:44.420> wouldn't<00:03:44.810> they<00:03:45.020> just<00:03:45.260> dispose<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220

mean wouldn't they just dispose of it
somewhere<00:03:46.610> else<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.209> they<00:03:47.600> still<00:03:47.870> had

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
somewhere else so that they still had

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.820 
somewhere else so that they still had
the<00:03:48.140> cell<00:03:48.380> something<00:03:50.200> okay<00:03:51.200> there<00:03:51.500> are<00:03:51.590> so

between the vertebral discs and the part
of<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.670> ribs<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.209> attached<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.720> ribcage<00:04:08.959> to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
of the ribs that attached the ribcage to

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.009 
of the ribs that attached the ribcage to
the<00:04:09.769> sternum<00:04:10.070> or<00:04:10.340> cartilage<00:04:11.239> they<00:04:11.630> would<00:04:11.900> have

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
the sternum or cartilage they would have

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.660 
the sternum or cartilage they would have
been<00:04:12.170> rotted<00:04:12.590> if<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.890> thing<00:04:13.100> had<00:04:13.280> become<00:04:13.430> a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
been rotted if the thing had become a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.809 
been rotted if the thing had become a
skeleton

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
skeleton

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.180 
skeleton
and<00:04:14.969> furthermore<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.380> joints<00:04:16.829> are<00:04:16.949> held

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and furthermore the the joints are held

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.060 
and furthermore the the joints are held
together<00:04:17.400> by<00:04:17.639> ligaments<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.259> those<00:04:19.859> would

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
together by ligaments so those would

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
together by ligaments so those would
have<00:04:20.130> been<00:04:20.220> rotted<00:04:20.609> too<00:04:20.759> so<00:04:21.030> what<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> fuck<00:04:21.690> is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
have been rotted too so what the fuck is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.189 
have been rotted too so what the fuck is
holding<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.320> skeleton<00:04:22.860> together<00:04:23.509> huh<00:04:24.570> The

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
holding this skeleton together huh The

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.840 
holding this skeleton together huh The
Book<00:04:25.380> of<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.590> Dragonborn<00:04:26.190> how's<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.610> for

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
Book of the Dragonborn how's that for

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.390 
Book of the Dragonborn how's that for
plot<00:04:27.000> convenience<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.979> is<00:04:29.130> what<00:04:29.310> it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
plot convenience so this is what it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.950 
plot convenience so this is what it
looks<00:04:29.580> like<00:04:29.729> before<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.270> rock<00:04:30.449> comes<00:04:30.720> down

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
looks like before the rock comes down

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.100 
looks like before the rock comes down
and<00:04:31.289> crushes<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> bridge<00:04:32.009> and<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:33.960> what

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
and crushes the bridge and this is what

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.379 
and crushes the bridge and this is what
it<00:04:34.199> looks<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.500> after<00:04:35.300> there's<00:04:36.300> no

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
it looks like after there's no

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.879 
it looks like after there's no
difference<00:04:36.960> where<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.410> hell<00:04:37.530> did<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> rock

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
difference where the hell did the rock

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.939 
difference where the hell did the rock
come<00:04:38.160> from<00:04:38.479> okay<00:04:39.479> so<00:04:39.539> I<00:04:39.990> guess<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.289> can<00:04:40.470> excuse<00:04:40.919> a

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
come from okay so I guess I can excuse a

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.189 
come from okay so I guess I can excuse a
fort<00:04:41.340> having<00:04:41.729> an<00:04:41.820> escape<00:04:42.150> tunnel<00:04:42.389> you<00:04:42.870> know<00:04:42.900> in

the<00:04:45.990> hell<00:04:46.350> would<00:04:46.500> they<00:04:46.620> put<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.009> escape

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
the hell would they put the escape

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.360 
the hell would they put the escape
tunnel<00:04:47.610> right<00:04:48.030> under<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.690> prison<00:04:52.009> wait<00:04:53.009> but
