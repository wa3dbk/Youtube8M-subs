 of a sweet that is trend the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.600
 3 - although they are sweets as well you have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 said you are now trend and the 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.040
 history of where they come from they are from 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.540
 America specifically from the USA in each 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.030
 denomination is not known exactly by 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.239
 what it is and is because the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 cups as a measure to make the recipe or 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.360
 well it's called that because the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.250
 cup as a mold to make the cupcake 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 then it became fashionable here in europe 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 thanks to the new york xinzo series 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.670
 what will you remember and if very well and now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.340
 as well as the highest trend is your 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 same as it is one of the things 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.690
 fundamentals to do at home what 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 you can do with the children to spend 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 a fun afternoon or to do with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 friend 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 simply to celebrate birthdays or 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 you want me 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.970
 Well, let's go to work 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.970
 cupcake 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.310
 the two bases are the classic 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.570
 vanilla and chocolate from here 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.790
 we can add all the ingredients 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 that we want to fill them with jams 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.560
 that we want the recipe is the classic 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.150
 recipe that we all have cupcakes 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.140
 of the grandmother of always the one of all the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.060
 zone 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 we just have a little less than 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.159
 yeast because we do not want it to rise 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.590
 you see that the classic cupcakes 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.390
 they have to go up and these were never to do 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 after the decoration very well 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.679
 the decoration because we have two types of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.270
 decoration that we can use that is 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.270
 the frosting that is called 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.020
 and the one that is made with cream based 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.000
 is a coverage that is what is 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 does with less sugar paste in this 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.710
 case list here age if this is that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.120
 we have brought here are a little bit expensive 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.550
 the Christmases that we have them very close 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.210
 and then what the subject was telling you 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.950
 children before them is very easy 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.190
 to use because the sugar paste is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.810
 as they are called fine and nothing is removed 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.910
 Children's play dough to the previous 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.490
 edible they delighted very 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.920
 surprising to work with them what 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.080
 is that product because it is very easy to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.820
 use for them even easier 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.770
 that for us and good and all the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.780
 creativity that you can and that's already 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.280
 how we were not with the Christmas theme 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.120
 we have used a little bit of gold 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.720
 Edible to give it the color very 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.520
 classic christmas 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.700
 plated then what better to use gold 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.390
 and silver to do it I love they have 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.390
 a great pint 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.060
 to elaborate one to see it here in situ 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.280
 in this case we have used cream 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.430
 Swiss meringue is more suitable for 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.470
 European tastes than the classic horsehair to 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.450
 Americans who only butter 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 with sugar that is very cloying 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.470
 few besides and for us then 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.989
 you have a pastry bag in this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.340
 the case of the throwaway and a 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.910
 nozzle that is with the wide drawing 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.910
 you can see how easy it is to 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 take care of him 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.340
 just as good looking 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.290
 it's chocolate so it 's all for 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.120
 enjoy all and now let's use 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.860
 if you think the special ingredient 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.650
 Well, we're going to put a little bit of 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.280
 banana to see how it turns 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.280
 the movie 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.750
 How beautiful is a Christmas tree and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.860

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.889
 we have been doing all the time of what 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.860
 that we have been talking about are neither cakes 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.479
 then we will do it as if it were 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.650
 one minita Yes because I have wanted 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.610
 to prove it like this we open first 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.610
 the capsule 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.659
 a little knife we ​​cut the portions of 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.659
