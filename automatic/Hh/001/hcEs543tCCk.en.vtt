Stefan modded clip pop your darts in i'm
only<00:01:56.030> using<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:56.480> for<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:58.070> example<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.890> goes

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
only using two for this example it goes

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.530 
only using two for this example it goes
in<00:02:01.100> real<00:02:01.490> easy<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:01.940> just<00:02:02.000> kind<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.300> hard<00:02:02.360> to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
in real easy it's just kind of hard to

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.279 
in real easy it's just kind of hard to
get<00:02:02.660> out

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.280 

and<00:02:09.739> yes<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.759> pretty<00:02:11.239> much<00:02:11.299> do<00:02:11.629> have<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.049> slam

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and yes you pretty much do have to slam

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.530 
and yes you pretty much do have to slam
it<00:02:12.469> in<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.730> an<00:02:13.849> anger<00:02:14.090> breach<00:02:14.299> and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it in because it's an anger breach and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.780 
it in because it's an anger breach and
that's<00:02:14.689> how<00:02:14.840> their<00:02:15.019> setup<00:02:15.349> works<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.799> know<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that's how their setup works I know it

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's how their setup works I know it
doesn't<00:02:17.269> look<00:02:17.510> good<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.500> that's<00:02:18.920> how<00:02:19.069> about

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
doesn't look good but that's how about

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.729 
doesn't look good but that's how about
so<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.629> go<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:23.260> load<00:02:24.670> pic<00:02:25.670> shot<00:02:26.739> very

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
very accurate very fast very deadly by

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.710 
very accurate very fast very deadly by
the<00:02:33.980> way<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:34.400> inch<00:02:34.700> breach<00:02:34.970> actually

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
the way this inch breach actually

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.679 
the way this inch breach actually
functions<00:02:36.430> smoother<00:02:37.430> than<00:02:37.579> mine<00:02:37.819> does<00:02:40.689> it's

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
functions smoother than mine does it's

Maverick I had made a patchy chart for
you<00:03:41.060> but<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.329> ran<00:03:41.629> out<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.870> petty<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.680> last

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
you but I ran out of petty on the last

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.750 
you but I ran out of petty on the last
barrel<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:45.159> realized<00:03:46.159> that's<00:03:46.340> very

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
barrel so I realized that's very

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.869 
barrel so I realized that's very
depressing<00:03:47.530> because<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.709> was<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.159> closely<00:03:49.579> but

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
depressing because it was so closely but

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.099 
depressing because it was so closely but
then<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.120> last<00:03:50.239> girl<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.750> didn't<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.079> a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
then the last girl just didn't have a

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.309 
then the last girl just didn't have a
thing<00:03:51.379> and<00:03:52.269> obviously<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.449> doesn't<00:03:53.750> work<00:03:54.079> so

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
thing and obviously that doesn't work so

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.909 
thing and obviously that doesn't work so
i<00:03:54.379> swapped<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.829> out<00:03:54.949> for<00:03:55.389> one<00:03:56.389> of<00:03:56.510> my<00:03:56.569> other
