handle<00:00:15.990> every<00:00:16.260> bottle<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.710> extreme<00:00:17.160> care<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
handle every bottle with extreme care to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.580 
handle every bottle with extreme care to
avoid<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.180> sediment<00:00:18.570> being<00:00:18.779> disturbed<00:00:19.230> nah

during the test the color let's face it
entire<00:00:22.800> experience<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.750> sediment

entire experience so the sediment

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
entire experience so the sediment

your invention on it and which it seal
it<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.560> we'll<00:01:36.649> see<00:01:36.860> an<00:01:36.920> upside<00:01:37.280> down<00:01:37.630> leave

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
it up and we'll see an upside down leave

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.900 
it up and we'll see an upside down leave
it<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> month<00:01:39.500> tap<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.399> every<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:40.759> and

it for a month tap it every now and
again<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.240> get<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.390> sediment<00:01:41.899> off<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.170> off

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
again to get the sediment off the off

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.310 
again to get the sediment off the off
the<00:01:42.679> walls<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.940> need<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:44.630> this

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the walls if you need to and then this

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.039 
the walls if you need to and then this
is<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> really<00:01:45.890> clever<00:01:46.250> part<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.240> cat<00:01:47.780> breaks

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
is the really clever part the cat breaks

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.800 
is the really clever part the cat breaks
into<00:01:48.259> two<00:01:48.500> doesn't<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:50.479> your

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
here it may be a problem i'm thinking

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.949 
here it may be a problem i'm thinking
cuz<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.400> idea<00:04:19.669> is<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.880> take<00:04:19.910> clear<00:04:20.419> beer<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.930> a

cuz the idea is to take clear beer to a
party<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.820> possible<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.690> people<00:04:23.930> are

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
example no haven't given that a thought

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.420 
example no haven't given that a thought
at<00:04:38.150> all<00:04:38.300> because<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.750> got<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.190> nice<00:04:40.190> time

but you can take it out with here what
have<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.330> learned<00:04:44.540> here<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.930> just<00:04:45.290> think<00:04:45.380> I'm

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
have you learned here I just think I'm

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.050 
have you learned here I just think I'm
just<00:04:45.950> imagining<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.490> at<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.880> situation

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
just imagining that at the situation

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.159 
just imagining that at the situation
where<00:04:47.389> you're<00:04:47.450> going<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> be<00:04:47.720> drinking<00:04:47.900> beer

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
where you're going to be drinking beer

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.450 
where you're going to be drinking beer
you<00:04:48.290> may<00:04:48.500> not<00:04:48.680> be<00:04:48.830> thinking<00:04:48.860> where<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.280> put

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
you may not be thinking where you put

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.090 
you may not be thinking where you put
the<00:04:49.580> cap<00:04:49.760> yes<00:04:50.120> well<00:04:50.600> what<00:04:50.750> could<00:04:51.530> only<00:04:51.680> help<00:04:51.919> us

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
the cap yes well what could only help us

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.300 
the cap yes well what could only help us
in<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.310> long<00:04:52.340> term<00:04:52.610> yeah<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.950> leads<00:04:58.160> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
in the long term yeah that leads to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.890 
in the long term yeah that leads to
another<00:04:58.490> thing<00:04:58.760> but<00:04:58.910> if<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.150> ended<00:04:59.510> possible

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
another thing but if you ended possible

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.110 
another thing but if you ended possible
divided<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.260> cap<00:05:00.470> separately<00:05:01.039> and<00:05:01.280> then<00:05:01.760> when

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
divided the cap separately and then when

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.270 
divided the cap separately and then when
you've<00:05:02.270> got<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.630> whole<00:05:02.870> range<00:05:03.560> than<00:05:03.830> brewing<00:05:04.130> up

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
you've got a whole range than brewing up

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.830 
you've got a whole range than brewing up
you<00:05:04.460> leave<00:05:04.639> those<00:05:04.850> on<00:05:04.880> there<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.510> you<00:05:05.630> use

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
you leave those on there and you use

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.010 
you leave those on there and you use
more<00:05:06.260> caps<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.610> body<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:08.060> recycled

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
more caps but the body is recycled

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.240 
more caps but the body is recycled
initially<00:05:09.410> now<00:05:09.500> we're<00:05:09.680> not<00:05:09.770> going<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.100> if<00:05:10.160> it

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
initially now we're not going to if it

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.300 
initially now we're not going to if it

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.430 
view that's going to be the big driver
so<00:05:49.580> if<00:05:49.910> there<00:05:50.090> are<00:05:50.210> opportunities<00:05:50.479> to<00:05:50.870> look<00:05:51.229> at

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
so if there are opportunities to look at

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.560 
so if there are opportunities to look at
the<00:05:51.680> material<00:05:51.919> as<00:05:52.550> well<00:05:52.610> as<00:05:52.970> manufacturing

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
the material as well as manufacturing

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.390 
the material as well as manufacturing
process<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.289> bring<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.590> price<00:05:54.770> down<00:05:54.830> would

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
process to bring the price down would

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.129 
process to bring the price down would
certainly<00:05:55.639> make<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:55.970> a<00:05:56.120> lot<00:05:56.479> more<00:05:56.510> attractive

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
certainly make it a lot more attractive

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.820 
certainly make it a lot more attractive
