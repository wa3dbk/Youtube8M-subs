00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
turn out the way we wanted to be in a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.010 
turn out the way we wanted to be in a
rough<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.250> mean<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:21.029> great<00:00:21.570> start<00:00:21.840> get

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
rough first I mean a great start get

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.349 
rough first I mean a great start get
those<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.380> calls<00:00:22.619> blows<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> then<00:00:23.910> we

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
those two calls blows but and then we

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.720 
those two calls blows but and then we
got<00:00:24.539> into<00:00:24.660> pound<00:00:24.990> trouble<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.519> back

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
got into pound trouble and they got back

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.259 
got into pound trouble and they got back
into<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.180> game<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:28.250> but<00:00:29.250> after<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
into the game but but after the first I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
into the game but but after the first I
think<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.480> dominate<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> game<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.790> think<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.880> had

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
think we dominate the game I think I had

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.530 
think we dominate the game I think I had
published<00:00:33.989> six<00:00:34.260> seven<00:00:35.040> shots<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.300> last

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
published six seven shots in the last

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.930 
published six seven shots in the last
two<00:00:36.719> periods<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> played<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
two periods so I think we played a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.860 
two periods so I think we played a
bloody<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.780> hockey<00:00:40.020> game<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:41.750> didn't<00:00:42.750> pay
