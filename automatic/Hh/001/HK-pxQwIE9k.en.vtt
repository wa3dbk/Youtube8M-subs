00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.800
 enormously the developers victor and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.640
 the waters that made the very good tackle 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.180
 so I noticed that when I 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.610
 presented a fake apple watch he did not 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.840

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.090

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.410

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 so unfortunately we can not anymore 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.830
 organize competitions on youtube 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.050
 that's why I had to go 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.540
 on other social networks because 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.850

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.130
