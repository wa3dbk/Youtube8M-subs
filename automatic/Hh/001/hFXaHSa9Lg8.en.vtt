do not run co2 or do a selfie 02 but
instead<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.340> Excel<00:00:18.140> which<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
instead I use the Excel which is a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.580 
instead I use the Excel which is a
replacement<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> co2<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.080> fourth<00:00:22.410> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
placement off the fertilizer and the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640 
placement off the fertilizer and the
trace<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:26.520> should<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> there

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
trace it should be pretty good but there

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
trace it should be pretty good but there
will<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:29.659> quite<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> while<00:01:30.900> hotel<00:01:31.229> use<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.619> all

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
will be quite a while hotel use up all

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
will be quite a while hotel use up all
this<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.250> bet<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.630> quite<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> while

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
this I bet you see they so quite a while

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.530 
this I bet you see they so quite a while
and<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.950> still<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.579> lot<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
and I still have a lot of them now I

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.350 
and I still have a lot of them now I
don't<00:01:39.540> reduce<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.040> amount<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.729> i<00:01:41.880> should<00:01:42.210> be

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
don't reduce the amount that i should be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
don't reduce the amount that i should be
tossing<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.829> an<00:01:44.070> attraction<00:01:45.259> what<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tossing like an attraction what I do is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.969 
tossing like an attraction what I do is
that<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.520> toss<00:01:48.090> them<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.770> if

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that actually other toss them because if

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.469 
that actually other toss them because if
you<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.340> don't<00:01:50.939> stem<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> algae

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you or don't stem you get a lot of algae

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
you or don't stem you get a lot of algae
so<00:01:54.479> why<00:01:54.720> don't<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.229> site<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> dole

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so why don't you do site on the dole

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.420 
so why don't you do site on the dole
stem<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.509> smart<00:01:57.750> mouth<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:59.219> poor

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
stem very very smart mouth and a poor

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.380 
stem very very smart mouth and a poor
very<00:01:59.670> small<00:01:59.939> amount<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> tank<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
very small amount them into the tank and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
very small amount them into the tank and
that<00:02:03.390> keeps<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> LG<00:02:04.020> away<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.399> seems<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that keeps the LG away and it seems to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 
that keeps the LG away and it seems to
work<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.439> lot<00:02:07.740> of
