another<00:05:16.270> story<00:05:16.830> but<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.220> said<00:05:18.520> I've

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
another story but like I said I've

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.640 
another story but like I said I've
checked<00:05:19.510> amidst<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:19.960> board

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
checked amidst the board

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.930 
checked amidst the board
or<00:05:21.570> all<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.840> other<00:05:23.430> resistors<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.610> thing<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
or all the other resistors and thing to

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.570 
or all the other resistors and thing to
that<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.300> don't<00:05:26.229> see<00:05:26.350> anything<00:05:26.590> else<00:05:26.830> blown<00:05:27.130> off

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
that I don't see anything else blown off

that I don't see anything else blown off
in<00:05:27.610> most<00:05:28.000> couple<00:05:28.270> resistors<00:05:28.720> on<00:05:28.990> that

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
in most couple resistors on that

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.090 
in most couple resistors on that

comment so into that they can cut me out
for<00:05:44.139> when<00:05:44.320> I'm<00:05:44.440> ready<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.860> put<00:05:45.699> this<00:05:45.820> new<00:05:46.030> board

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
for when I'm ready to put this new board
