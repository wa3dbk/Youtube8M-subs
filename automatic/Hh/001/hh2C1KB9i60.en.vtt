00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 alexis sanchez says that his 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.649
 figure to his father because we can 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.649
 Identify what you created in your life 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:21.029
 a graphologist without the highest milk and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.340
 sanchez let's say the meaning with you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 also but he figure is his dad or 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.480
 the internal image of his dad because in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.449
 the fund is not exactly my dad but 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 that's how I saw my dad as well as 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.230
 I live the person who gave me then 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 day i get alexis sanchez is a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 person that when you allied with the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 dad or with dad's figure good one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.379
 father figure that maybe they can not have 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 to speak something clear one seeks to achieve 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730
 Objective things One is responsible 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 when one of why the people to the champion 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.890
 There is every comment doctor 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 graphologist is the idea that the figure of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.329
 dad can be sometimes that they are moms that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.600
 they are dad and no more 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.130
 Wanted quieter what you are looking for is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.930
 a target style person 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:15.039
 these people play a paternal role 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:17.500
 because identify here I'm going to show 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.840
 a way to analyze the signature since 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.720
 is by the zones already alexis to more if 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.899
 what predominates in him in the future and 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.460
 finally because everything that is to the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.079
 right in the writing represents the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.600
 future because a part from here from 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.479
 the past into the future he has a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.990
 style of not looking at the future forgiveness 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.979
 today's past and that's why I can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 withstand the pressures that I have been 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.580
 supporting him he is always looking towards 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.220
 future project seeks imagines itself 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.770
 same has 40 na from the moment in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.890
 that he went out he was in the barcelona not 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 be children as they sign the signatures 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.759
 most important part is in the load to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 final let's say is to know what it represents 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.700
 the stable future the times 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.080
 as a child when someone signs 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 only with the first name is one 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.770
 how many children for that when for example 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.350
 when I was younger you take jail 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.300
 and losing that was recorded to me that's me 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.610
 when child then when people 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.280
 sign that look with the name now 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.430
 it will be taught of it not sure when 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.010
 sign only with the first name 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.550
 that I am a Marxist is like the son and the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.550
 son more 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.190
 accompanies us 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.830
 in the test signature scenes 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.140
 one minute to close with the widening 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.260
 we see that alexis is super 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.330
 important in the child 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.860
 then he loads the end but he feels 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.230
 any difference between writing only the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.940
 initial to write the full name to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.880
 alexis 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 this is like a kind of theoretical self 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.890
 as I say goodbye to something it seemed is 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.220
 as the idealized child's elio that when 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.510
 when boy and that gave him his fame but 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.510
 actually what motivates him
