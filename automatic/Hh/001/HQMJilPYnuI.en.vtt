00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 and they take this out to the fly or the insect 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 that grabs and then votes if 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 after they ate it full 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 the remaining shell of the insect 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:21.600
 but if we talk about a cockroach has 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 the skeleton and absorbs the substances 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.410
 nutrients that have juices 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.990
 gastric everything all that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.490
 the white light now is you can 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.520
 feed also by placing a bug 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.370
 they are fed only leaves us their care 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.079
 these are us but the other one is more 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 easy they come alone because that is what 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.160
 said professors have the little tip 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.160
 droplets that apart from being glue are 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.160
 which they attract life 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.940
 the sheet closes like this because it has 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.940
 some sensors inside each now 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:12.530
 but it's not how long you eat the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.570
 little bug for example something week that for 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.520
 example me and a week surely in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.530
 one week plus series and the other that the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.630
 trap occupy it twice each time by 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.110
 example this time I think the last and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.780
 then throw it away 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.030
 a new insect comes out eat everything 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.170
 but sometimes when for example where 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.570
 they live they do not know why for example 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.910
 a seed inside or a stone by 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.619
 some reason fight is closed and then 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.610
 it reopens maximum spin on 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.610
 butterfly effect 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.960
 it is still small it still does not grow 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.369
 everything that is here the size arrives or 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.740
 be this because it can be like this 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.479
 like from a hand is different species 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.470
 there are some called giant that is 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.470
 More or less like 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.630
 and videos that have been on the internet 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.399
 to eat a mouse seriously 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 there is something that there is something that there 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 add that it's important that you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.130
 you said inside the two sheets 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.080
 changing that is a real trap and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.080
 this was later invented by man 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.550
 in the layers for another copy of the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.780
 inside but if you look at loading 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.300
 the camera could do it here in the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.690
 palm interior 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.209
 it has some dangers and it already has a 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.930
 very similar protrusion let's say like 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.269
 a true fine fang 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.489
 are those that the insect can walk 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.549
 in as long as you do not touch 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.870
 that 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.870
 this crocodile 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.799
 is here 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:44.060
 these plants that we had at 20 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.799
 20 thousand pesos open but now it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.049
 they ended up because I made Christmas fly 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.490
 but let's have these are the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.470
 crops us 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.430
 to 15,000 will be the outbreaks after 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.430
 that are good in this house 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.960
 this one has like six months something like that is 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:17.780
 true that some very fast in this 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:21.310
 case you do not have to change it special not 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.420
 can use sheet earth or any 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.420
 professor of nutrients
