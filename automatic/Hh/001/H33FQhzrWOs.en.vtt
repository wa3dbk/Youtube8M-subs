internet and I was looking at that in
these<00:00:17.010> verses<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.119> moon<00:00:18.720> turning<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
last days and so I went to NASA's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730 
last days and so I went to NASA's
website<00:00:29.760> NASA<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.140> government<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.710> a

they'll be a total lunar eclipse what
part<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> country<00:00:55.770> everything<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.550> all

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
part of the country everything it's all

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.630 
part of the country everything it's all
based<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.030> math<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> went<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
based on math so I went to the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
based on math so I went to the
government's<00:01:00.180> website<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> looked<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
government's website and I looked in the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.750 
government's website and I looked in the
next<00:01:02.789> decade<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.629> from<00:01:03.780> 2000<00:01:04.320> 82<00:01:04.580> 2018<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
next decade it was from 2000 82 2018 is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.410 
next decade it was from 2000 82 2018 is
when<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:05.909> looked<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> i<00:01:06.750> noticed<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.950> year

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
when i looked and i noticed in the year

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
when i looked and i noticed in the year
2014<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> year<00:01:10.310> 2015<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:12.060> were

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
2014 and in the year 2015 there were

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320 
2014 and in the year 2015 there were
four<00:01:12.720> total<00:01:13.619> blood<00:01:13.979> moons<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.700> row<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
four total blood moons in a row back to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.050 
four total blood moons in a row back to
back<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.290> partial<00:01:16.920> lunar<00:01:17.070> eclipses<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
back with no partial lunar eclipses in

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
back with no partial lunar eclipses in
between<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.009> website<00:01:20.009> said<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
between and the website said that the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
between and the website said that the
government<00:01:21.150> calls<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.720> tetrad<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
government calls this a tetrad when you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.320 
government calls this a tetrad when you
have<00:01:22.830> four<00:01:23.070> blood<00:01:23.340> moons<00:01:23.369> back-to-back<00:01:24.119> with

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
have four blood moons back-to-back with

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
have four blood moons back-to-back with
no<00:01:24.860> partial<00:01:25.860> lunar<00:01:26.490> eclipses<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> middle

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
no partial lunar eclipses in the middle

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
no partial lunar eclipses in the middle
and<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.530> thought<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:29.009> well<00:01:29.490> how

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and so my first thought was well how

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.819 
and so my first thought was well how
often<00:01:29.970> does<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.390> happen<00:01:30.470> what's<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> math

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
often does this happen what's the math

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.520 
often does this happen what's the math
what's<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> probability<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.939> having<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
what's the probability of having this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.140 
what's the probability of having this
well<00:01:34.530> when<00:01:34.680> i<00:01:34.710> had<00:01:34.950> looked<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.670> weren't<00:01:35.880> any

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
well when i had looked there weren't any

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.319 
well when i had looked there weren't any
at<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.799> 1800's<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:38.850> were<00:01:38.970> none<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
at all in the 1800's there were none in

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
at all in the 1800's there were none in
the<00:01:39.420> 1700s<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.680> were<00:01:40.799> none<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> 1600s

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the 1700s there were none in the 1600s

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
the 1700s there were none in the 1600s
and<00:01:42.470> last<00:01:43.470> century<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.100> happened<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> be

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and last century there happened to be

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.690 
and last century there happened to be
too<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.750> there's<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.680> things<00:01:46.950> first<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.520> how

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
too but there's two things first off how

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.399 
too but there's two things first off how
often<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.210> there<00:01:48.450> four<00:01:48.720> blood<00:01:48.960> moons<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
often are there four blood moons in a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
often are there four blood moons in a
row<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> other<00:01:50.700> question<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.509> often

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
row then the other question is how often

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
row then the other question is how often
are<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.500> four<00:01:53.009> blood<00:01:53.310> moons<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.790> fall

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
are there for four blood moons that fall

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
are there for four blood moons that fall
on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.899> set<00:01:55.350> times<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> feast<00:01:56.460> days<00:01:56.729> well

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on the set times on the feast days well

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200 
on the set times on the feast days well

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
in the 1500s there was all of a sudden

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
in the 1500s there was all of a sudden
seven<00:02:00.540> tetrads<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.320> none<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> them<00:02:01.680> fell<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
seven tetrads but none of them fell on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
seven tetrads but none of them fell on
the<00:02:02.159> feast<00:02:02.340> days<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.479> could<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.990> tetrads

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the feast days so i could see tetrads

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399 
the feast days so i could see tetrads
were<00:02:04.770> rare<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.479> they<00:02:06.479> were<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.259> would

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409

be<00:02:07.530> even<00:02:07.710> rare<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.250> fell<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> feast

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
be even rare if they fell on the feast

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.809 
be even rare if they fell on the feast
days<00:02:09.119> well<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> went<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.920> 2014<00:02:11.790> and

I just saw the normal Gregorian calendar
dates<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.080> thought<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.590> didn't<00:02:17.160> see

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

anything<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.360> sudden<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.690> hit

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
anything and then all of a sudden it hit

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.930 
anything and then all of a sudden it hit
me<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.140> bolt<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.530> lightning<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.160> gotta<00:02:20.790> look

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
me like a bolt of lightning I gotta look

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.090 
me like a bolt of lightning I gotta look
at<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.300> biblical<00:02:21.810> calendar<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
what I did I converted it to where that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.070 
what I did I converted it to where that
falls<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.490> biblical<00:02:27.060> calendar<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.720> I
