00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.600
 yes and today 0 to 0 in mainz 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.340
 undecided perhaps to break 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.930
 a bit flattering was behind 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.170
 out but more than deserved or how 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.060
 would you rate that who was 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.599
 somehow not in there for us today 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.359
 We do not have our best game 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.830
 delivered 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.490
 The distances were big in the first 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.340
 half time came a bit behind 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.470
 Nevertheless, well-fought and the point 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.910
 Let's say you have your game 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.079
 could not go through so much 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.539
 Maybe that's what it has today 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.219
 So it's only half past time that it's clear 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.030
 the distances between know the chains 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 second half was a bit better 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.379
 but it was not all that great 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.629
 now he never goes to country break 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.160
 nonetheless a victory to kick off 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.059
 home now draw I think 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.989
 guess so you can first 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.690
 be satisfied or 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.410
 yes yes clearly so as I said point 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.180
 We're with us and we have a little break 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.060
 can maybe a few injured 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 come back 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.110
 approach the matter more calmly and then well 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 prepare to play on next round 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.530
 00 today in mainz i believe a lot 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.260
 intense game for you 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.760
 how do you evaluate the 90 minutes yes it 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.560
 was a blow I say 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.730
 we could have won the game i can 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
 then perhaps meant I will 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.420
 can win a bit the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.900
 Precision missing the last pass 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.660
 missing 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.550
 the peace also partly in front and so is 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.230
 the game 0 0 I assumed think 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 play is good we have again 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.530
 not lost I believe that now 70 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.380
 play in a row and yes we have to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.210
 continue to work now country break 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.590
 we have finished punctually now and 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 Thus , the next few weeks can be tough 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.850
 So we work in sourcing 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.740
 hassia three points that should bring yes 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.090
 I would say the goal now 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.820
 also only on the current season 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.530
 looks ahead dfb cup victory 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.450
 home now a draw away 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.680
 you will say good for now 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.870
 so start the country break 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.310
 go or yes, it is a good start 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.560
 as I said have not lost 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.479
 got a point even though we got more 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.910
 wanted and would have it in the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.989
 meat skillfully but I think that in 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.379
 end the 00 I think so too 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.090
 is earned and therefore we are satisfied 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.630
 But we can still be our mistake 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 reappraise 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.920
 so we call in the circle again three 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.540
 points straight forward many great opportunities 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.300
 what do you mean what did it have what 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.960
 Maybe you also tell him now 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.640
 I think we are a bit too 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.810
 warned hastily that we better than 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.850
 would have looked for someone instead 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.460
 but to complete such difficult 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.840
 times have been good in the lead 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.890
 we had a little bit of trouble 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.210
 but that's part of it 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.270
 they are the first we do so 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.800
 played with q yes also a bit 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.000
 Drill practice and have patricks 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.620
 units to get fit 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.850
 nevertheless, they are doing well this year 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.220
 made in mainz a point brought what 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.090
 not so easy and that's why 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.980
 I am very satisfied with the team 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.980
 although I know that it is even better
