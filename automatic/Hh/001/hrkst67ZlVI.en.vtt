just noises well sometimes trigger the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
just noises well sometimes trigger the
speakable<00:01:47.280> items<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> found<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
speakable items so I found that it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.069 
speakable items so I found that it's
best<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> either<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.070> keyword<00:01:50.720> which<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
best to either have a keyword which can

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.300 
best to either have a keyword which can
be<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.409> bit<00:01:52.530> annoying<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:52.950> times<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
be a little bit annoying at times I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
be a little bit annoying at times I
always<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> say<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> keyword<00:01:54.149> or<00:01:54.509> my

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
always have to say the keyword or my

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.990 
always have to say the keyword or my
favorite<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> listen<00:01:56.430> only<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.700> key<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
favorite is to listen only what key is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
favorite is to listen only what key is
pressed<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> by<00:01:58.469> default<00:01:58.680> escape<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
pressed and that is by default escape of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
pressed and that is by default escape of
course<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.210> change<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
course you can change that right here so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.289 
course you can change that right here so
in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.070> case<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> microphone

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in this case you can see the microphone

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
in this case you can see the microphone
is<00:02:03.390> inactive<00:02:03.869> until<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.229> hold<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> Escape

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
is inactive until I hold down the Escape

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
is inactive until I hold down the Escape
key<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> starts<00:02:06.390> listening<00:02:06.979> now

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
key and then it starts listening now

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.619 
key and then it starts listening now
under<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> commands<00:02:08.640> tab<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.450> all

once you're this little microphone

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.220 
once you're this little microphone
floating<00:02:16.879> here<00:02:17.030> might<00:02:17.480> say<00:02:17.660> that's<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.019> little

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
floating here might say that's a little

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.750 
floating here might say that's a little
bit<00:02:18.319> annoying<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> always<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.099> say<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.580> so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
bit annoying to always have say there so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.309 
bit annoying to always have say there so
if<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.060> double<00:02:20.239> click<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.780> it'll

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
if you just double click on it it'll

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.720 
if you just double click on it it'll
slide<00:02:21.560> right<00:02:21.739> down<00:02:21.860> into<00:02:22.069> your<00:02:22.129> dock<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
can see it still works when it's in my

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
can see it still works when it's in my
back<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.519> still<00:02:25.819> say<00:02:26.000> something<00:02:26.360> like

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
back so I can still say something like

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.759 
back so I can still say something like
what<00:02:27.080> time<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.500> it

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
what time is it

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.100 
what time is it
it's<00:02:28.840> 658<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.620> knows<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:32.810> there's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
it's 658 and it knows so it now there's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.750 
it's 658 and it knows so it now there's
no<00:02:33.260> immediately<00:02:33.769> obvious<00:02:33.890> way<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.640> what

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
no immediately obvious way to see what

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.640 
no immediately obvious way to see what
kind<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.030> commands<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.599> can<00:02:35.660> tell<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.530> if
