00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.360
 welcome to the digital weekly with a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.580
 summary in the image of this beginning of the year 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.140
 that is to say few outputs but all of 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.740
 even of the quality so black pin of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.660
 bubbles that pics and afterburn climax side 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.369
 tests we looked at metal slug 2 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 before leaving on images of a 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 pinball game stamped star wars 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.470
 black magpies is an original way of your 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.930
 pinball games with games in hand 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.610
 against one in real time we note that the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.990
 physical and very accomplished than 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.910
 multiple power-ups appear 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.110
 expect to spice up the parties and that 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.760
 many construction tables 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.260
 particularly well- sensed respond 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.820
 On call 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.830
 only downside when the battery up to 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 right of the screen gets to zero and you 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.130
 have to wait for a certain number of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.810
 minutes to replay a game by 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.250
 therefore intended for small session 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.250
 but we recommend you anyway 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 previously released on machines 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.890
 arcade psn and xbla the after burner 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.560
 climax puts you in command of a 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.970
 customizable combat aircraft the goal 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.510
 of the game is to defeat an entire army to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.010
 you alone 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.660
 while one of the three game modes 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.040
 allows you to slow down the time in order to 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.820
 lock several opponents and 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 shoot them down the chain 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.560
 after launching metal slug 3 in 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.659
 last July and but you have the gain in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.040
 December snk playmore publishes this 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.400
 week the second part of the series 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.110
 cult released on neogeo side scenario on 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.369
 embodies one of the four falcon sent 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.040
 on the ground to stop the plans 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.750
 diabolical of the general morden to your 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.020
 provision a real arsenal of 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 war 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.470
 second start of the overpowered vehicles 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.909
 such as a bipedal tank 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.460
 a fighter plane or a 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.990
 dromedary equipped with guns 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.550
 Veterans have already understood 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.050
 this metal slug of is not that 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.360
 Beastly and naughty adaptation of the game 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 original because the studio has foam 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 is responsible for making it new 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.000
 characters and slugz but it's not 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.560
 all because all the patches 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.019
 made to the two previous components are 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.580
 taken again such as auto shooting and mode 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.140
 window to configure the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.970
 buttons icons off the screen of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.690
 game which brings us to the point most 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.300
 damaging 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.860
 the ergonomics of the virtual stick we note 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.630
 thus frustrating inaccuracies in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.459
 the moments of intense action a 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.300
 criticism also valid for 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.160
 previous titles 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.569
 and it is with disappointment that we notice 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.620
 that a solution was not found 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.630
 meanwhile the final metal slug two 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 vintages 2013 is doing well with a 6 on 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.549
 10 dying tea a copy that will seduce 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.620
 fans of very high challenge and what 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.380
 with new content not to mention 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.519
 fun cooperation via bluetooth 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.900
 remains to be done however big 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.610
 concessions regarding maneuverability 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.610
 very imprecise virtual stick 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.980
 it's time to close this 47th 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.810
 episodes on images of the next dlc 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.519
 star wars of zen pinball 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.959
 as for me I tell you to the week 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.530
 next for new releases of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.599
 ios games 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.599
 by then play well salty
