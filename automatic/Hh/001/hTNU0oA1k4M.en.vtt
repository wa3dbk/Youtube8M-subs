00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.179
 So that's the pharmacy tool puts 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.630
 We are in part 60 and indeed 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.840
 equipped with so-called spline 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.039
 use 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.240
 this little inserts to a kind 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 barking profile 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.789
 but that is a profile that is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.039
 Compatible with the most diverse woman 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 I have my demo here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 maybe you can prepare 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 see that on the video 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 there is a normal square 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 screw then we have an x10 here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 screwed here a small screw 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 that there is an outside torx screw 24 that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.539
 is one I can believe three quarters 26 can 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 screw and here we have one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.399
 metric 19 millimeter screw and in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.320
 in the middle a softened screw 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.620
 because this little inserts in particular 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 also for already explored writing heads 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 This can be used safely 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.600
 grasp and turn 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.550
 I'm stuck now so gradually 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.129
 on that is a sc 19 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.830
 So it goes on the operation 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 be or four not screw it the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.260
 of course goes to the stone use 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.759
 he needs to be due for the day 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.670
 namely and especially on 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 Already allied woman heads that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 material we use is a very 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.729
 high quality brumann a-team government 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.079
 nickel plated several times and then 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.009
 accredited manufacturer as well as the sizes are 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.170
 permanently lasered 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.530
 what else to say next to the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.869
 Both levers ratchet included here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.980
 there are also one and a half should 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.480
 and a 1 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.310
 hitachi you have where you for example 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.830
 fast screwing must perform 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.080
 or cramped space conditions 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.190
 These are finger slips from 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.470
 great advantage 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.050
 which is of course switchable from the right 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.490
 on the left as well as the two 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.490
 big lever ran 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.400
 it's the little one-quarter to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.740
 you certainly know universal kardan 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.450
 also from your normal tool box 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.790
 however, most are one 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 lever joint this is again 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.390
 There is nowhere else in the world patented 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.230
 another box apart from us per 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.660
 day back we have a bullet here 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.630
 connection and through this sphere 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.350
 Connection is this universal karan um 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.580
 full 360 degrees usable 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.250
 turn one and the same in the one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.040
 quarter inch execution last but not least 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.320
 and that is another highlight we have 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 here a quick extension half 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.930
 inch and this rapid extension has 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.430
 to find two elementary advantages 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.830
 they nowhere else but at 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 We have a ball lock for us 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.769
 use the bridge steps so that the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.950
 can not be deducted 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.380
 and you have to remove the ball 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.799
 Press down and then you can 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.769
 use only down the front 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.340
 a strong magnet built in case you 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.240
 once made very heavy screws 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.800
 want to get out bolts 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.570
 These become captive on this 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.200
 kept neodymium magnets and he is like that 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.240
 strong that once elevates all these big ones 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.820
 lausanne or even this 250th 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.110
 millimeter extension deduction check 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.420
 800 grams 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.940
 As I said only with us eco offered 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.770
 Tool in this piece of key box 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.770
 60 to receive in part 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.940
 All in all a super complete set 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.120
 of course its price 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.520
 but compared with the quality and the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.350
 Compatibility of the inserts actually 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.940
 a great bargain and then enjoy 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.670
 would see it they look forward soon 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
 to welcome as customers and report 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.700
 me as soon as something new at the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.970
 pharmacy tool front goes until then 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.970
 bye
