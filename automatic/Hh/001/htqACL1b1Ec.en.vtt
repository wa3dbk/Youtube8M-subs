00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.099 
check it out on my channel yeah the
plastic<00:00:23.760> texture<00:00:24.240> pack<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> text

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
plastic texture pack is one of the text

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.859 
plastic texture pack is one of the text
vector<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.279> simplicity<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.720> well

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
vector I do like for simplicity as well

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
vector I do like for simplicity as well
as<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> fact<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.500> does<00:00:28.800> sort<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
as the fact that it does sort of you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.070 
as the fact that it does sort of you
know<00:00:29.400> sort<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.760> glow<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.689> really

know sort of glow and it's like really

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.490 
know sort of glow and it's like really
simple<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.239> too<00:00:33.630> detailed<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
chunky cool little texture pack that you

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
chunky cool little texture pack that you
can<00:00:38.280> use<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.879> builds<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.899> like

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
can use for your builds it's just like

can use for your builds it's just like
really<00:00:40.620> nice<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.280> punchy<00:00:41.610> texture<00:00:41.940> pack

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
really nice and a punchy texture pack

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
really nice and a punchy texture pack
that<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.500> use<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.250> yeah<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> is

stuff<00:00:55.340> now<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.000> texture<00:00:57.329> pack

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
stuff now you can use this texture pack

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
stuff now you can use this texture pack
I<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.780> recommend<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> text<00:00:58.710> pad<00:00:58.859> for

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
I would recommend this text pad for

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
I would recommend this text pad for
stuff<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.340> houses<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:00.960> little

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
stuff like houses and you know little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
stuff like houses and you know little
stores<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.609> well<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> built<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
stores as well because I built like a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
stores as well because I built like a
McDonald's<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> text<00:01:04.530> pack<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
McDonald's in this text pack and it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
McDonald's in this text pack and it
looked<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> worked

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
looked really really well it worked

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
looked really really well it worked
really<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.140> well<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:07.830> certain

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
really really well I mean certain

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
really really well I mean certain
buildings<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.880> bare<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.390> certain<00:01:10.200> texture

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
buildings look bare in certain texture

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
buildings look bare in certain texture
pack<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.979> texture<00:01:11.250> pack<00:01:11.280> works<00:01:11.760> really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pack so this texture pack works really

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
pack so this texture pack works really
well<00:01:12.450> modern<00:01:12.750> buildings<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> such<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
well modern buildings and such like that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
well modern buildings and such like that
I<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.760> would<00:01:14.850> work<00:01:14.880> too<00:01:15.240> well

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
I don't think it would work too well

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
I don't think it would work too well
with<00:01:15.600> modern<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.530> Victorian<00:01:17.130> buildings<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
with modern like Victorian buildings and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100 
with modern like Victorian buildings and
stuff<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.659> these

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
stuff like that so as you can see these

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
stuff like that so as you can see these
buildings<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:19.920> looking<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.520> very

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
buildings here are looking very very

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
buildings here are looking very very
nice<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.619> text<00:01:22.860> rack<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
nice this is just text rack that you can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.330 
nice this is just text rack that you can
use<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.650> build<00:01:25.950> your

and cobblestone and stuff just doesn't

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.710 
and cobblestone and stuff just doesn't
look<00:02:28.040> too<00:02:28.310> nice<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.910> texture<00:02:29.300> pack<00:02:29.510> so

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
look too nice in the texture pack so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.840 
look too nice in the texture pack so
that's<00:02:29.930> why<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.590> kind<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.250> stopped<00:02:31.460> using<00:02:31.610> this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that's why I kind of stopped using this

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.250 
that's why I kind of stopped using this
texture<00:02:32.180> pack<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.660> seems<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:33.080> bit

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
texture pack and it just seems a bit

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.040 
texture pack and it just seems a bit
less<00:02:33.860> vibrant<00:02:34.430> than<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.030> next<00:02:35.510> texture<00:02:35.840> pack

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
less vibrant than the next texture pack

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.290 
less vibrant than the next texture pack
that<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.620> will<00:02:36.860> show<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:37.850> yet<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.150> guys
