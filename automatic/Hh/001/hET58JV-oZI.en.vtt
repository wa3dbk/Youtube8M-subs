00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
features of a product now we usually

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.089 
features of a product now we usually
keep<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> product<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.060> four<00:00:24.949> quadrants<00:00:25.949> you

now the first quadrant this is the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.870 
now the first quadrant this is the
vertical<00:01:23.040> plane<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.759> the

vertical plane and this is the
horizontal<00:01:24.150> plane<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.409> now<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
horizontal plane as you can see now you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.600 
horizontal plane as you can see now you
give<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.240> rotation<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:28.259> 90<00:01:28.320> degrees<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
give a rotation of 90 degrees to the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.719 
give a rotation of 90 degrees to the
vertical<00:01:30.450> horizontal<00:01:30.840> plane<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
vertical horizontal plane so that it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
vertical horizontal plane so that it
becomes<00:01:33.119> vertical<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> observer<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
becomes vertical now the observer is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
becomes vertical now the observer is
here<00:01:35.340> supposing<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> observer<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
here supposing if the observer is here I

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.249 
here supposing if the observer is here I
have<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.810> my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
have to do it like this now this is my

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.999 
have to do it like this now this is my
first<00:01:40.740> quadrant<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.460> am<00:01:42.030> giving<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.860> rotation<00:01:43.860> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
first quadrant I am giving a rotation of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.109 
first quadrant I am giving a rotation of
90<00:01:44.310> degrees<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.189> clockwise<00:01:47.189> 90<00:01:47.640> degrees

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
90 degrees to the clockwise 90 degrees

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
90 degrees to the clockwise 90 degrees
to<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> horizontal<00:01:48.689> plane<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.189> becomes

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to the horizontal plane so this becomes

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
to the horizontal plane so this becomes
vertical<00:01:51.420> plane<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.110> becomes<00:01:52.530> our

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
vertical plane and this becomes our

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.670 
vertical plane and this becomes our
horizontal<00:01:53.490> plane<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.689> intersection<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
horizontal plane this intersection of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.929 
horizontal plane this intersection of
the<00:01:55.770> HP<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.219> VP<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:57.119> call<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> XY

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the HP and VP we call that as the XY

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.230 
the HP and VP we call that as the XY
line<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.770> keep<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> product<00:02:02.880> here
