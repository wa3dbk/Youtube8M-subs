 some masses of the superficial parrot extinction 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.460

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.170
 in captivity she survived from 15 to 20 years ago because people 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.589
 Hand in the wrong way. 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.100

 even though it can not 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.450
