I do here I've actually got a cowl now
that<00:00:42.030> suits<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> system<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.230> well<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that suits the system very well this

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
that suits the system very well this
this<00:00:43.950> day<00:00:44.190> healthy<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this day healthy I can get them back in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
this day healthy I can get them back in
calf<00:00:46.020> every<00:00:46.379> year<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> they

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
calf every year so they they can they

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.750 
calf every year so they they can they
can<00:00:48.239> carry<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> producing<00:00:49.140> milk<00:00:49.610> Marco<00:00:50.610> what

can carry on producing milk Marco what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
can carry on producing milk Marco what
do<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> riches<00:00:51.570> choices<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
do you think of riches choices here I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
do you think of riches choices here I
think<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.550> obviously<00:00:53.850> every<00:00:54.149> dairy

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
think it's it's obviously every dairy

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
think it's it's obviously every dairy
farmer<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.870> unique<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.500> very

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
farmer is unique and it's very

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
farmer is unique and it's very
interesting<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:56.969> time<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
interesting to see how much time is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.819 
interesting to see how much time is
actually<00:00:57.539> spend<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> developing<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
actually spend on developing the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.830 
actually spend on developing the
breeding<00:00:59.129> program<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.640> his<00:00:59.760> own<00:00:59.850> herd<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
breeding program for his own herd and I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.119 
breeding program for his own herd and I
think<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:01.559> most<00:01:01.739> farmers

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think that's really what most farmers

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.889 
think that's really what most farmers
will<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:03.149> tell<00:01:03.270> me<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.690> about

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
will do just tell me a little bit about

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.210 
will do just tell me a little bit about
the<00:01:04.080> different<00:01:04.409> breeds<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> find<00:01:05.070> in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the different breeds of the find in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730 
the different breeds of the find in
Britain<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:06.270> Britain<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Britain in Britain we really do see a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
Britain in Britain we really do see a
variety<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> breeds<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> varies<00:01:09.630> because

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
variety of breeds and it varies because

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
variety of breeds and it varies because
there's<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> lot<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> different<00:01:11.010> systems<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's a lot of different systems in

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
there's a lot of different systems in
the<00:01:11.490> UK<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> need<00:01:12.780> different

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the UK and for that we do need different

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
the UK and for that we do need different
grades<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> suit<00:01:13.530> their<00:01:13.890> systems<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
grades to suit their systems so in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
grades to suit their systems so in
Britain<00:01:15.659> when<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.020> Scotland<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
Britain when we go to Scotland it's a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.749 
Britain when we go to Scotland it's a
different<00:01:17.100> animal<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.490> we'll<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
different animal then we'll go to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.340 
different animal then we'll go to
Cornwall<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.479> example<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Cornwall for example because of the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.219 
Cornwall for example because of the
grazing<00:01:19.920> systems<00:01:20.460> etc<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> reach<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> God

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.660

how<00:02:11.150> important<00:02:11.600> is<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:11.900> farmers<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.440> have

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
how important is it for farmers to have

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740 
how important is it for farmers to have
a<00:02:12.710> breeding<00:02:13.040> program<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.640> place<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.600> it's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
a breeding program in place I think it's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.060 
a breeding program in place I think it's
critical<00:02:15.200> really<00:02:15.530> because<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
critical really because it's the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.160 
critical really because it's the
foundation<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.700> start<00:02:16.850> working<00:02:17.300> from<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:18.080> we

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
foundation to start working from if we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.390 
foundation to start working from if we
can<00:02:18.260> get<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> genetics<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
can get the genetics right and the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.520 
can get the genetics right and the
breeding<00:02:19.700> program<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.300> work<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.660> right<00:02:20.870> then

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
breeding program to work with right then

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.780 
breeding program to work with right then
it<00:02:21.650> means<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.040> animal<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.400> going<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> be

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
it means that the animal is going to be

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.190 
it means that the animal is going to be
healthy<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.720> health<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.050> welfare

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
healthy and that the health and welfare

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
healthy and that the health and welfare
is<00:02:24.410> going<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.680> looked<00:02:24.830> after<00:02:25.010> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
is going to be looked after and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
is going to be looked after and
ultimately<00:02:25.940> also<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> farmer<00:02:26.750> therefore

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
ultimately also the farmer therefore

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.870 
ultimately also the farmer therefore
will<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.380> happy<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.490> something<00:02:28.760> like

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
will be happy to see something like

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.570 
will be happy to see something like
cloning<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.420> quite<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> hot<00:02:29.990> topic<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.650> what

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
cloning is quite a hot topic and what

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.310 
cloning is quite a hot topic and what
sort<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> stages<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.960> dairy<00:02:33.200> industry

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
sort of stages is the the dairy industry

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.200 
sort of stages is the the dairy industry
and<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.010> cloning<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.790> essence<00:02:35.090> is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
and with that cloning in essence is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.960 
and with that cloning in essence is
still<00:02:35.420> very<00:02:35.690> much<00:02:35.960> in<00:02:36.740> development<00:02:37.340> stages<00:02:37.580> in

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
still very much in development stages in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.820 
still very much in development stages in
the<00:02:38.150> UK<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:38.810> not<00:02:39.020> allowed<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.440> be<00:02:39.470> cloning

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
the UK it's not allowed to be cloning

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.530 
the UK it's not allowed to be cloning
and<00:02:40.130> therefore<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.790> dairy<00:02:41.000> industry<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and therefore the dairy industry in the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.480 
and therefore the dairy industry in the
UK<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.960> actually<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.320> involved<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:42.830> cloning

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
time and I'm seeing you know I'll see

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.710 
time and I'm seeing you know I'll see
the<00:03:48.290> growing<00:03:49.040> from<00:03:49.190> little<00:03:49.430> calves<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.090> then

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
the growing from little calves and then

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.630 
the growing from little calves and then
then<00:03:51.410> coming<00:03:51.740> through<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.040> into<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.310> milking

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
then coming through and into the milking

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.550 
then coming through and into the milking
parlor<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.690> know<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:54.020> seeing<00:03:54.200> seeing

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
parlor and you know just seeing seeing

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.170 
parlor and you know just seeing seeing
how<00:03:54.740> they<00:03:54.890> do<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> mean<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:55.730> really<00:03:55.880> good<00:03:56.090> but

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
how they do I mean it's really good but

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.000 
how they do I mean it's really good but
it<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> very<00:03:56.810> long<00:03:57.140> term<00:03:57.470> process<00:03:57.710> takes<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it is a very long term process takes a

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.610 
it is a very long term process takes a
long<00:03:58.190> time<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.760> but<00:03:59.750> no<00:03:59.900> I'm<00:04:00.050> in<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.290> results

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
long time and but no I'm in the results

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.310 
long time and but no I'm in the results
are<00:04:00.710> very<00:04:00.770> rewarding
