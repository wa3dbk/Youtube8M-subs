about<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.250> um<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.590> point<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.100> was<00:01:14.250> tired<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
about so um at that point I was tired of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
about so um at that point I was tired of
it<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.970> thought<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.420> should<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:15.630> solution

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it and I thought I should find solution

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.050 
it and I thought I should find solution
and<00:01:16.560> once<00:01:17.009> I'd<00:01:17.189> found<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> solution<00:01:17.939> which

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and once I'd found the solution which

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.020 
and once I'd found the solution which
was<00:01:18.210> super<00:01:18.659> easy<00:01:18.710> I'm<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
was super easy I'm going to make that a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.960 
was super easy I'm going to make that a
point<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.479> share<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.700> is
