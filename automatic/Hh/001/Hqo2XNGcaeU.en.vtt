come together and we're really happy
about<00:00:39.030> how<00:00:39.239> everyone<00:00:39.629> worked<00:00:40.140> together<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
about how everyone worked together to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
about how everyone worked together to
get<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> actually

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
get it all done in time when it actually

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
get it all done in time when it actually
works<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.290> amazing<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.430> sometimes<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
works it's amazing like sometimes I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
works it's amazing like sometimes I
wanted<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> close<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.840> eyes<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.010> turn

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wanted to close my eyes and then I turn

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
wanted to close my eyes and then I turn
around<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.270> I'd<00:00:48.390> look<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.899> it'd<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.050> perfect

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
around or I'd look and it'd be perfect

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.900 
around or I'd look and it'd be perfect
and<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.030> amazing<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.760> these

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and it was amazing but for these

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
and it was amazing but for these
students<00:00:54.360> robots<00:00:54.840> climbing<00:00:55.350> ramps<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
rolling over gravel is also about so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
rolling over gravel is also about so
much<00:00:58.289> more<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:59.039> potentially<00:00:59.760> far-reaching

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
much more with potentially far-reaching

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.799 
much more with potentially far-reaching

because<00:01:52.079> obviously<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> much<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.479> world

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720

into<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> course<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:07.439> we're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
into this course and see what we're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
into this course and see what we're
going<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.770> ask<00:02:07.890> them<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.819> kind<00:02:09.119> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
going to ask them to do and they kind of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.009 
going to ask them to do and they kind of
think<00:02:09.330> oh<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.629> end<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> semester

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
think oh and the end of the semester

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.839 
think oh and the end of the semester
they<00:02:13.349> have<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> functioning<00:02:14.250> robot<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.730> can

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
they have a functioning robot that can

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.640 
they have a functioning robot that can
can<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.629> everything<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.080> asked<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.500> do

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
can do everything we asked them to do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.339 
can do everything we asked them to do
and<00:02:16.800> that's<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.489> that's<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> kind<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.870> feeling

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
and that's a that's the kind of feeling

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.259 
and that's a that's the kind of feeling
that<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:19.920> young<00:02:20.459> engineers<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> get

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
that we want young engineers to get

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.580 
that we want young engineers to get
hooked<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.910> class<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.510> also<00:02:24.989> very<00:02:25.260> much

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
hooked on this class is also very much

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.530 
hooked on this class is also very much
about<00:02:25.920> teamwork<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> dealing<00:02:27.330> with<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
about teamwork and dealing with the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.050 
about teamwork and dealing with the
group<00:02:27.720> dynamic<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.500> genders<00:02:28.980> work<00:02:29.430> ethics<00:02:29.849> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
group dynamic of genders work ethics and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.229 
group dynamic of genders work ethics and
personalities<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.890> certainly<00:02:32.549> pass<00:02:32.970> along

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
personalities we certainly pass along

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.970 
personalities we certainly pass along
technical<00:02:33.780> skills<00:02:34.019> in<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.680> it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
technical skills in here it's it's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.120 
technical skills in here it's it's
definitely<00:02:35.340> part<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.519> what<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:37.230> more

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
definitely part of what we do but more

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410 
definitely part of what we do but more
importantly<00:02:38.610> than<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.090> probably<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
importantly than that and probably a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.089 
importantly than that and probably a
greater<00:02:39.690> percentage<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.290> our<00:02:40.349> time<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:41.069> spent

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
greater percentage of our time is spent

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.850 
greater percentage of our time is spent
on<00:02:41.519> soft<00:02:41.849> skills<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:43.470> something<00:02:43.709> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
on soft skills and it's something that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770 
on soft skills and it's something that
engineers<00:02:44.310> need<00:02:44.579> when<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.630> leave

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
engineers need when they when they leave

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
engineers need when they when they leave
school<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.110> move<00:02:46.319> on<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.190> something

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
school to move on and it's something

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.819 
school to move on and it's something
that<00:02:47.579> well<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.690> unique<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.560> wild

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
that well it's not unique to the wild

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.140 
that well it's not unique to the wild
school<00:02:50.099> hopefully<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.670> something<00:02:50.819> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
school hopefully it's something that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.479 
school hopefully it's something that
we're<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.799> focusing<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.950> where<00:02:53.190> others

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
we're really focusing on where others

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.400 
we're really focusing on where others
aren't<00:02:53.700> overall<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> goal<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.870> create<00:02:55.079> a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
aren't overall the goal is to create a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.490 
aren't overall the goal is to create a
robot<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.459> will<00:02:57.269> sample<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.140> remediate

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
robot that will sample and remediate

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.589 
robot that will sample and remediate
water<00:02:58.739> but<00:02:59.040> there's<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.970> much<00:03:00.090> more<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.329> it

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
water but there's so much more to it

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.390 
water but there's so much more to it
than<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:01.349> get<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> work<00:03:01.890> together<00:03:02.069> as<00:03:02.340> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
than that we get to work together as a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.970 
than that we get to work together as a
team<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.000> learn<00:03:03.329> skills<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.319> will<00:03:04.560> help<00:03:04.590> us

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
team and learn skills that will help us

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.699 
team and learn skills that will help us
in<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:06.450> future<00:03:06.750> project<00:03:07.170> as<00:03:07.319> well<00:03:07.440> as

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
in with future project as well as

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.150 
in with future project as well as
hopefully<00:03:08.190> for<00:03:08.670> careers
