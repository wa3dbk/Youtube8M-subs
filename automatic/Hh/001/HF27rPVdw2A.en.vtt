the board and um I've been training
jumping<00:03:34.200> higher<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.500> higher<00:03:34.970> trying<00:03:35.970> other

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
jumping higher and higher trying other

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.560 
jumping higher and higher trying other
programs<00:03:36.959> such<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.160> air<00:03:38.340> alert<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570

programs such as the air alert it's a
really<00:03:39.930> well<00:03:40.110> known<00:03:40.290> program<00:03:40.940> for<00:03:41.940> getting<00:03:42.270> is

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
really well known program for getting is

really well known program for getting is
jump<00:03:42.840> higher<00:03:43.080> increase<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.160> vertical<00:03:44.310> jump

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
jump higher increase your vertical jump

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.020 
jump higher increase your vertical jump
but<00:03:46.140> um<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:46.980> want<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.370> most<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> grow

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
with shoes and now at the top of my

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.670 
with shoes and now at the top of my
performance<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:08.970> right<00:04:09.420> above<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.320> blue

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
performance I'm right above this blue

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.340 
performance I'm right above this blue
line<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.239> can<00:04:12.570> clearly<00:04:12.900> see<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:14.090> go

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
line so you can clearly see if I go

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.189 
line so you can clearly see if I go
zooming<00:04:16.350> out<00:04:17.150> where<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.359> blue<00:04:18.690> spot<00:04:19.049> is
