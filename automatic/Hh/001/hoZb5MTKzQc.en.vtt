the<00:00:18.510> sensor<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.699> piece<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.689> cybernetic

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
the sensor was a piece of cybernetic

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.830 
the sensor was a piece of cybernetic
sculpture<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:23.699> responded<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.480> movement

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
sculpture which responded to movement

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
sculpture which responded to movement
and<00:00:25.050> sound<00:00:26.029> it<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.240> based<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.560> design<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and sound it was based on the design and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.200 
and sound it was based on the design and
functionality<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:31.070> lobster<00:00:32.070> claw<00:00:32.340> it

crane all of the structure was
hand-built<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.540> put<00:00:39.960> together<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.829> of

wasn't animal make sure he was
interested<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.140> think<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.620> well<00:01:48.830> maybe

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
interested to think that well maybe

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.490 
interested to think that well maybe
it'll<00:01:49.970> make<00:01:50.210> people<00:01:50.630> realize<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.260> lot<00:01:51.470> of

that just mechanical because if a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.840 
that just mechanical because if a
machine<00:01:55.970> can<00:01:56.510> look<00:01:57.140> like<00:01:57.350> animal<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.520> behaving

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
and whenever we after a question you

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.550 
and whenever we after a question you
know<00:02:01.700> who<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.240> are<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.980> was<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.370> its<00:02:04.580> day<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.210> was

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
know who we are it was of its day it was

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.280 
know who we are it was of its day it was
ages<00:02:06.560> ahead<00:02:06.800> of<00:02:06.920> its<00:02:07.100> time<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.960> mean<00:02:08.960> you<00:02:08.990> could

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
ages ahead of its time I mean you could

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.550 
ages ahead of its time I mean you could
run<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.920> sensor<00:02:10.340> off<00:02:10.460> your<00:02:10.670> phone<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.410> you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
run the sensor off your phone now if you

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.220 
run the sensor off your phone now if you
wanted<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.180> could<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.540> easily<00:02:14.780> be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
wanted to so it could be easily be

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.770 
wanted to so it could be easily be
redone<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.850> think<00:02:17.150> his<00:02:17.330> point<00:02:17.360> would<00:02:17.750> have

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
redone but I think his point would have

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.080 
redone but I think his point would have
been<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.070> had<00:02:19.520> all<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.970> could

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
been that if you had all that you could

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.300 
been that if you had all that you could
do<00:02:20.180> something<00:02:20.450> better<00:02:20.709> there's<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.800> kinds<00:02:22.250> of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
do something better there's all kinds of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.070 
do something better there's all kinds of
technology<00:02:23.030> now<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.240> people<00:02:23.840> are<00:02:23.930> just

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
technology now that people are just

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.100 
technology now that people are just
terribly<00:02:24.680> blase<00:02:25.100> about<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:26.750> wouldn't

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
terribly blase about and it wouldn't

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.900 
terribly blase about and it wouldn't
have<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> same<00:02:27.770> impact<00:02:28.100> anyway<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> did

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
have the same impact anyway if you did

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.270 
have the same impact anyway if you did
it<00:02:29.060> now
