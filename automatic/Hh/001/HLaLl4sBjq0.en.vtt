trying<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.210> old<00:00:15.389> snow<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.850> haven't

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
trying it out in some old snow I haven't

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.040 
trying it out in some old snow I haven't
really<00:00:18.029> been<00:00:18.090> able<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.449> give<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> try

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
really been able to give it a try

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
really been able to give it a try
because<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> hasn't<00:00:19.830> snowed<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
because it hasn't snowed here in about a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
because it hasn't snowed here in about a
week<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> half<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.500> fact<00:00:22.710> almost<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
week and a half in fact almost all of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.560 
week and a half in fact almost all of
our<00:00:23.430> snow<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.789> gone<00:00:25.910> okay<00:00:26.910> by<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> numbers

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
our snow is gone okay by the numbers

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.099 
our snow is gone okay by the numbers
what<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> did<00:00:28.019> back<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:29.119> I<00:00:30.119> extended<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
what I did back here is I extended the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.290 
what I did back here is I extended the
original<00:00:31.710> bumper<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.420> made<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:34.130> little<00:00:35.300> steel

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
original bumper and made a little steel

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.549 
original bumper and made a little steel
basket<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:38.070> hold<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.840> one-pound<00:00:39.840> coffee<00:00:40.200> cans

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
basket to hold two one-pound coffee cans

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.670 
basket to hold two one-pound coffee cans
full<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.980> concrete<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.899> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> my<00:00:43.290> steel

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
full of concrete and a lot of my steel

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.170 
full of concrete and a lot of my steel
rims<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.719> some<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.230> old<00:00:46.379> bent<00:00:46.710> nails

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
rims and some you know old bent nails

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
rims and some you know old bent nails
basically<00:00:48.180> whatever<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.550> added<00:00:50.550> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
basically whatever I had I added in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
basically whatever I had I added in
there<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.090> turned<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.870> about<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.199> 25

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there they turned out to be about a 25

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.389 
there they turned out to be about a 25
pounds<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> piece<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:55.890> 50

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
pounds of piece so that's about 50

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.529 
pounds of piece so that's about 50
pounds

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
pounds

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920 
pounds
that's<00:00:58.039> about<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> set<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.180> store-bought

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's about what a set of store-bought

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.820 
that's about what a set of store-bought
wheel<00:01:01.260> weights<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:02.070> weigh<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> believe

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
wheel weights would weigh so I believe

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.830 
wheel weights would weigh so I believe
it'll<00:01:05.299> probably<00:01:06.299> work<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.750> fine<00:01:08.840> you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it'll probably work out just fine you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.910 
it'll probably work out just fine you
guys<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.200> already<00:01:10.320> seen<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> chains<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.630> made

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
guys have already seen the chains I made

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
guys have already seen the chains I made
they<00:01:13.920> seem<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.430> working<00:01:14.760> fine<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
they seem to be working fine on the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.200 
they seem to be working fine on the
final<00:01:17.369> version<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.380> did<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.890> ahead<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> add<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
final version I did go ahead and add a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.679 
final version I did go ahead and add a
winch<00:01:22.640> even<00:01:23.640> though<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.880> lover<00:01:24.119> worked<00:01:24.420> really

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
winch even though my lover worked really

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.179 
winch even though my lover worked really
good<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> viewers<00:01:28.350> said<00:01:28.950> he

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
good like one of the viewers said he

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.780 
good like one of the viewers said he
wasn't<00:01:29.430> getting<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> lift<00:01:30.119> he<00:01:30.329> wanted<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.320> of

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
wasn't getting the lift he wanted out of

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.660 
wasn't getting the lift he wanted out of
using<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> pulley<00:01:33.090> system<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.670> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
using a pulley system and I really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.960 
using a pulley system and I really
wasn't<00:01:35.880> either<00:01:37.040> another<00:01:38.040> suggestion<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.759> had

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
wasn't either another suggestion I had

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.469 
wasn't either another suggestion I had
for<00:01:39.600> soft<00:01:41.060> ground<00:01:42.530> plowing<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> snow<00:01:44.490> was

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
for soft ground plowing of the snow was

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
for soft ground plowing of the snow was
to<00:01:45.689> add<00:01:45.899> wheels<00:01:46.700> which<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.850> did<00:01:50.180> by<00:01:51.180> adding

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to add wheels which I did by adding

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
to add wheels which I did by adding
those<00:01:51.540> wheels<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.540> keeps<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> blade

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
those wheels it actually keeps the blade

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
those wheels it actually keeps the blade
up<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:57.049> concrete<00:01:58.049> here<00:01:58.290> roughly<00:01:58.979> an<00:01:59.159> inch<00:01:59.420> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
up on concrete here roughly an inch that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.530 
up on concrete here roughly an inch that
allows<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.939> like<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> said<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.270> haven't<00:02:03.390> had

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
allows for like I said we haven't had

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
allows for like I said we haven't had
any<00:02:03.750> snow<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.649> tried<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
any snow but I just tried it out on the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.540 
any snow but I just tried it out on the
unfrozen<00:02:06.119> ground<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:09.470> sank<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:10.739> about

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
unfrozen ground and it sank down about

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.369 
unfrozen ground and it sank down about
1/2<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.300> 3/4<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.110> inch

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
1/2 to 3/4 of an inch

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.940 
1/2 to 3/4 of an inch
I<00:02:13.500> still<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.459> my<00:02:14.489> blade<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.090> off<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.450> dirt<00:02:15.629> I'm

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
I still had my blade up off the dirt I'm

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.290 
I still had my blade up off the dirt I'm
really<00:02:16.950> happy<00:02:17.129> with<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:18.709> as<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.220> said<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.700> did

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
really happy with that as I said I did

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.990 
really happy with that as I said I did
go<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:22.020> winch<00:02:22.890> instead<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.819> hand

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
go with a winch instead of the hand

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.860 
go with a winch instead of the hand
lever<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.520> other<00:02:26.700> thing<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.330> did<00:02:27.510> change

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
lever now one other thing I did change

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.410 
lever now one other thing I did change
from<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.560> original<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:30.239> did<00:02:30.750> eliminate<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
from the original as I did eliminate the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.259 
from the original as I did eliminate the
pivot<00:02:33.780> point<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.170> angle<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> blade<00:02:35.269> I'm

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
pivot point to angle the blade I'm

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.680 
pivot point to angle the blade I'm
thinking<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.260> may<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:38.310> back<00:02:38.580> at<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.300> later<00:02:39.599> time

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
thinking I may go back at a later time

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.860 
thinking I may go back at a later time
and<00:02:40.230> add<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.459> back<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.629> point

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and add that back in but at this point

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.110 
and add that back in but at this point
in<00:02:43.019> time<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.230> just<00:02:43.650> wanted<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.010> functional<00:02:44.550> ok

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
in time I just wanted it functional ok

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.660 
in time I just wanted it functional ok
the<00:02:45.360> operation<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> winch<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.739> remove

the operation of the winch and remove
all<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.879> wheels<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:49.519> actually<00:02:50.519> quite<00:02:50.760> simple

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:12.390 

I'll<00:02:53.519> demonstrate<00:02:53.849> now

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.880 

and<00:03:12.819> that's<00:03:13.090> all<00:03:13.269> there<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> granted<00:03:14.769> I

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
left the other wheel on the other side

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:25.080 
left the other wheel on the other side
for<00:03:16.840> demonstration<00:03:17.500> purposes<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:24.090> then

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
for demonstration purposes and then

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.350 
for demonstration purposes and then
reinstallation

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.590 

is<00:03:34.810> equally<00:03:35.290> as<00:03:35.470> quick<00:03:35.940> now<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.330> had<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.320 
couple of requests to actually see this
thing<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.150> operation<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:45.370> like<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:45.940> said<00:03:46.150> it

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
thing in operation like like I said it

small snow piles where I have either

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.270 
small snow piles where I have either
snow<00:03:53.740> blown<00:03:54.070> or<00:03:54.520> plowed<00:03:55.060> already<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.980> soon<00:03:57.190> as

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
snow blown or plowed already as soon as

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.500 
snow blown or plowed already as soon as
we<00:03:57.400> get<00:03:57.810> probably<00:03:58.810> more<00:03:58.900> than<00:03:59.230> two<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:01.270> three

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
we get probably more than two to three

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.670 
we get probably more than two to three
inches<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.930> snow<00:04:02.580> I'll<00:04:03.580> be<00:04:03.850> making<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.680> video

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
inches of snow I'll be making a video

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.740 
inches of snow I'll be making a video
demonstration<00:04:06.660> demonstrating<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
demonstration demonstrating the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.320 
demonstration demonstrating the
operation
