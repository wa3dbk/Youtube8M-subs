00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello ladies and gentlemen to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.250
 God favors you and me John 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.800
 cooler now I will test chisel 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.800
 sharpened under seventy five degrees and 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 this man blade done by him 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:27.260
 from rapido 6 m 5 but sharpening I did here 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.260
 look at the profile so that you can see 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.790
 lenticular for. 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.399
 she is considered the strongest so 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.640
 look first place strike 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:49.640
 test specimens 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 here you can see the chip from the first experience 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 so I prepared the test samples in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.690
 my last experience was dice from 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 PCB that protects the warhead from there 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.150
 did I she split now i took a spoon 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.600
 from metal I smeared it with such glue 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:37.070
 so that it does not jump soot and now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 I put it on here so I proceed to the experience 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.200
 I expose all the center by the way I remembered 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 it is also necessary here to smear with glue because 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.869
 when you expose cuddle oakley and he 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.479
 helps to avoid these extra 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.479
 movements 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.890
 that is, so as not to slip there 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:29.980
 the fate of the yogi did not slip off see 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:29.980
 connects everything neatly do 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.730
 I will expose 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:07.709
 all attention will now be a blow from a height 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.709
 1 meter so 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:36.140
 things went well, I tell you what I did 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.750
 here I see a chisel received solid 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.710
 damage I will do immediately 2 more experience 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.810
 for the purity of the experiment right now on 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:54.030
 your eyes here remember here 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.460
 here is this first experience here is the inscription 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.450
 in vanadium chrome and sympathetic with this 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.990
 the parties will do the second experience see the blow 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.860
 This turned out to be a toast 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:12.080
 turned the blade that is hit 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.080
 indirect turned some general 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:20.060
 unclean blow 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.280
 experiment here a notch 1 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:29.130
 i have now made the blade you are far away 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:39.320
 I will put it to be the second experience now 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:44.060
 I will set everything off the costumes now 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.060
 so I prepared everything for the second experience 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.780
 crayfish 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:29.520
 left from let go of the freight will try 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.520
 lay out anything so attention went 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.610
 including while the camera and look later in 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.320
 general i considered jagged by these 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.100
 two experiences and I can say lenticular 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.830
 behind . did her job 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.669
 rapid in this fight won see 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.240
 here is the first and second notch experience on 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.770
 chisels 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.200
 they are almost the same depth and here 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.530
 the first second experiment chipping at rapid speeds 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.410
 the second path is more depths and also 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.600
 here is the depth 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.450
 here is the second experience here here too 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.080
 The depth of maybe more here was probably more 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.950
 exact hit and the depth was greater here 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.340
 here look smaller depth and here 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.310
 also smaller but it is immediately apparent 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.979
 the eye can even see that the depth at rapid speeds and 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.700
 less chipping well here's one lenticular 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.000
 behind . 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.310
 from the first experience that was here at 30 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.290
 degrees of course 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.150
 rapid simply slipped but here 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:56.410
 also damage was seen here here 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:07:01.300
 now i will show you here i see here in 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:06.220
 in this case in the first even as not school 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:09.460
 these balls here, a school well 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.850
 small such tip such and take still 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.850
 a plus 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.300
 on chisel 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.300
 on chisel seen 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:27.430
 jagged deeper 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:42.470
 where 2 experience generally shows that a notch 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:44.440
 deep here and so in general thanks for 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.139
 attention to all the best 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.360
 necessarily support the project without 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.419
 your support the project will not be realized 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.900
 it will be very interesting to conduct these experiments 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:08:01.220
 with brand knives 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:05.659
 do not invest 50 rubles from 10 rubles 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.419
 project is such a little money in 

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:11.210
 principle, you can see something 

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:14.590
 new and so urge urge you all 

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.590
 help project
