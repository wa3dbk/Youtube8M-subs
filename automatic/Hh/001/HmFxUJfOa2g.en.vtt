00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
sight because I hear it has less recoil
um<00:01:37.850> yeah<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> watched<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.990> weezer

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
um yeah I watched one of a weezer

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780 
um yeah I watched one of a weezer
redemptions<00:01:40.799> video<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.189> he<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.369> saying<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
redemptions video and he was saying that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
redemptions video and he was saying that
all<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.329> reflex<00:01:42.780> sights<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> guns

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
all the reflex sights on all the guns

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
all the reflex sights on all the guns
bring<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> recoil<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
bring down the recoil but it like

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
bring down the recoil but it like
reduces<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> amount<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.950> sight<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> have

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
reduces the amount of sight the you have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.620 
reduces the amount of sight the you have
because<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> looks<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> site<00:01:48.540> is

like<00:03:22.270> yeah<00:03:22.570> what<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.900> mean<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:23.830> seems<00:03:24.010> like

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
like yeah what I mean it just seems like

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.160 
like yeah what I mean it just seems like
um<00:03:24.580> they<00:03:24.850> have<00:03:25.180> more<00:03:25.390> range<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.990> if<00:03:26.110> you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
um they have more range like if you

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.140 
um they have more range like if you
shoot<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> Python<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> seems<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.940> have

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
shoot the Python it seems but you have

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.460 
shoot the Python it seems but you have
to<00:03:28.360> be<00:03:28.450> Lily<00:03:28.690> right<00:03:28.960> next<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> each<00:03:29.320> other

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
to be Lily right next to each other

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.010 
to be Lily right next to each other
whereas<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.940> nit<00:03:31.390> Elevens<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.870> have<00:03:31.990> a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
whereas like the nit Elevens you have a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.390 
whereas like the nit Elevens you have a
little<00:03:32.170> more<00:03:32.260> range<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.830> can<00:03:32.860> actually<00:03:33.100> like

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
little more range you can actually like

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.810 
little more range you can actually like
use<00:03:33.820> them<00:03:34.060> more<00:03:34.470> um<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:36.130> like<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.370> weapon<00:03:36.670> and

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
use them more um more like a weapon and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.570 
use them more um more like a weapon and
not<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.060> like<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.240> desperate<00:03:37.720> hope<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.170> guess

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580
