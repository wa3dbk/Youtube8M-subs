masters for a license then I would be

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.249 
masters for a license then I would be
breaking<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> law<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.720> could<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> jail

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
breaking the law and I could go to jail

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
breaking the law and I could go to jail
I<00:01:19.560> guess<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.509> guess<00:01:21.509> they've<00:01:21.689> come<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.990> shoot

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I guess I guess they've come and shoot

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.780 
I guess I guess they've come and shoot
me<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.009> said<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.369> wasn't<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
me if I if I said that I wasn't going to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
me if I if I said that I wasn't going to
go<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> jail<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.340> that's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
go to jail but I think that's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370 
go to jail but I think that's
interesting<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:28.110> something

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
interesting that's that's something

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
interesting that's that's something
that's<00:01:28.740> quite<00:01:29.549> aggravating<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's quite aggravating to me and I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.600 
that's quite aggravating to me and I
find<00:01:30.869> licenses<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:33.500> insulting<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:36.439> I

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
find licenses to be insulting but I

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.390 
find licenses to be insulting but I
don't<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> thought<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> guess<00:01:40.400> my

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
don't know just a thought I guess my

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
don't know just a thought I guess my
lawyer<00:01:41.640> doesn't<00:01:41.939> agree<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.390> probably<00:01:42.750> is
