garland boobs going across the box and
not<00:00:32.879> being<00:00:33.059> cleaner<00:00:33.329> call<00:00:33.539> enough<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.050> but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
not being cleaner call enough really but

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
not being cleaner call enough really but
you<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.920> as<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.520> saw<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.329> need<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you know as you saw in it you do need to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
you know as you saw in it you do need to
be<00:00:36.600> better<00:00:36.859> despite<00:00:37.859> the<00:00:37.949> fact<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
be better despite the fact that I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.130 
be better despite the fact that I
barnsley<00:00:39.000> finished<00:00:39.269> with<00:00:39.420> 10<00:00:39.600> men<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
barnsley finished with 10 men and a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
barnsley finished with 10 men and a
young<00:00:40.320> substitute<00:00:40.800> goalkeeper<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
young substitute goalkeeper I think you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.939 
young substitute goalkeeper I think you
were<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> only<00:00:42.149> person<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.570> tested<00:00:42.949> that

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
were the only person that tested that

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.650 
were the only person that tested that
was<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.219> had<00:00:44.430> done<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.699> yeah<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.510> that's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
was I had done that yeah well that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
was I had done that yeah well that's
just<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:45.989> done<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.550> yeah<00:00:47.550> now

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
just it all done it and yeah now

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.330 
just it all done it and yeah now
obviously<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.359> a<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.539> low<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.660> confidence

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
obviously we're a bit low on confidence

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
obviously we're a bit low on confidence
obviously<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.629> four<00:00:51.629> managers<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.109> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
obviously with four managers in the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.700 
obviously with four managers in the
season<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.219> great<00:00:54.260> form<00:00:55.260> any<00:00:55.379> stretch

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
season it's not great form any stretch

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
season it's not great form any stretch
of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.859> imagination<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> flyers<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
of the imagination for the flyers but is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.329 
of the imagination for the flyers but is
the<00:00:58.350> cards<00:00:58.620> we've<00:00:58.739> been<00:00:58.769> dealt<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.190> them

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
the cards we've been dealt with them

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.279 
the cards we've been dealt with them
with<00:00:59.489> which<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.239> our<00:01:00.359> best<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.719> tickets

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
with which are our best two tickets

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
with which are our best two tickets
results<00:01:01.679> often<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> new<00:01:02.820> manager<00:01:03.030> comes

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
results often when a new manager comes

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
results often when a new manager comes
in<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:03.929> a<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> lift<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in there's a bit of a lift around the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.350 
in there's a bit of a lift around the
club<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.400> doesn't<00:01:05.700> seem<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.030> happened

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
club that doesn't seem to have happened

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.390 
club that doesn't seem to have happened
so<00:01:06.509> far<00:01:06.750> oh<00:01:06.960> maybe<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.799> obviously<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.280> in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so far oh maybe not obviously not in

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.710 
so far oh maybe not obviously not in
results<00:01:08.759> but<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.030> trying<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.360> best<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
results but we're trying our best on the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
results but we're trying our best on the
training<00:01:09.930> pitch<00:01:10.189> alka<00:01:11.189> sake<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:12.119> managers<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
training pitch alka sake for managers in

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
training pitch alka sake for managers in
the<00:01:12.659> season<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.259> I<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.729> ever

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the season is I don't think I've ever

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280 
the season is I don't think I've ever
heard<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.180> before<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:16.259> very

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
heard of it before so it's been very

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
heard of it before so it's been very
difficult<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.000> previous<00:01:18.420> managers

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
difficult and and the previous managers

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
difficult and and the previous managers
have<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.380> different<00:01:19.680> ideas<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> one

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
have about different ideas to the one

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
have about different ideas to the one
we've<00:01:20.850> we've<00:01:21.329> got<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.079> difficult<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
we've we've got now so it's difficult to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.319 
we've we've got now so it's difficult to
implement<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.340> exactly<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> want<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
implement what exactly you want this on

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.810 
implement what exactly you want this on
the<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:24.930> pitch<00:01:25.399> obviously<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.520> language

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the on the pitch obviously the language

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.010 
the on the pitch obviously the language
barriers<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.149> bit<00:01:27.329> difficult<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
barriers a bit difficult from the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.090 
barriers a bit difficult from the
sideline<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.619> he's<00:01:28.710> trying<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> give

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
sideline when he's trying to give

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
sideline when he's trying to give
instructions<00:01:29.869> some<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> lads<00:01:31.140> down

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
instructions some of the lads down

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.510 
instructions some of the lads down
understand<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.799> sign<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.659> difficult

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
understand what sign so it's difficult

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.830 
understand what sign so it's difficult
clearly<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.670> difficult<00:01:36.060> what<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> mail
