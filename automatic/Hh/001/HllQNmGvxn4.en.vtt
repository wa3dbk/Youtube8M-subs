until you complete the quest so what i

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.380 
until you complete the quest so what i
did<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.860> i<00:01:39.170> hooked<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:42.560> here<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
did was i hooked up here here is the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.210 
did was i hooked up here here is the
there's<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> chest<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> trap<00:01:47.009> chest

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
there's the chest it's a trap chest

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.630 
there's the chest it's a trap chest
so<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:50.330> chest<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:50.690> right<00:01:50.840> there<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.640> signal

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
so the chest is right there a signal

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.250 
so the chest is right there a signal
comes<00:01:52.820> out<00:01:53.030> because<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.690> trap<00:01:53.900> chest

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
comes out because it's a trap chest

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.380 
comes out because it's a trap chest
redstone<00:01:55.010> signal<00:01:55.130> comes<00:01:55.790> both<00:01:56.030> these<00:01:56.210> sides

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
redstone signal comes both these sides

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.650 
redstone signal comes both these sides
and<00:01:56.840> it's<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.410> gets<00:01:57.770> pushed<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:59.210> first<00:01:59.390> signal

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
and it's it gets pushed the first signal

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.050 
and it's it gets pushed the first signal
comes<00:01:59.840> through<00:01:59.930> here<00:02:00.230> -<00:02:00.500> dick<00:02:00.650> delay<00:02:00.890> BAM<00:02:01.370> into

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
comes through here - dick delay BAM into

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.140 
comes through here - dick delay BAM into
this<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.390> with<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.380> same<00:02:03.410> two<00:02:03.800> tick<00:02:04.040> delay<00:02:04.220> it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
this one with the same two tick delay it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.780 
this one with the same two tick delay it
hits<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.560> what<00:02:06.680> happens<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
hits this one so what happens is the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.560 
hits this one so what happens is the
block<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:08.540> an<00:02:08.630> T<00:02:08.780> flip-flop<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.540> show

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
block it's an T flip-flop and so to show

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.370 
block it's an T flip-flop and so to show
you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.900 

so<00:02:17.380> what<00:02:17.500> happens<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:17.980> basically<00:02:18.310> pushes

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
so what happens it just basically pushes

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.490 
so what happens it just basically pushes
the<00:02:19.000> block<00:02:19.150> over<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.020> even<00:02:20.200> though<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.350> is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the block over and even though this is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.380 
the block over and even though this is
still<00:02:20.560> receiving<00:02:21.010> power<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.520> has<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.850> updated

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
still receiving power it has not updated

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.740 
still receiving power it has not updated
yet<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.920> won't<00:02:24.180> push<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> back<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.630> that's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
yet so it won't push it back and that's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.870 
yet so it won't push it back and that's
how<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> lights<00:02:26.280> stay<00:02:27.280> off<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
how the lights stay off and that's the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.870 
how the lights stay off and that's the
first<00:02:31.090> part<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> second<00:02:32.110> part<00:02:32.880> that's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
first part of it the second part that's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.680 
first part of it the second part that's
yeah<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.630> one<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> legs<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.260> off<00:02:36.690> yeah

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
yeah it's one of the legs to go off yeah

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.770 
yeah it's one of the legs to go off yeah
then<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.620> has<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.820> loop<00:02:40.060> through

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
then it has to have to loop through

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.290 
then it has to have to loop through
heater<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.260> long<00:02:41.530> delay<00:02:42.220> into<00:02:43.180> this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
heater this long delay into this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.090 
heater this long delay into this
dispenser<00:02:43.690> which<00:02:44.020> drops<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.500> skeleton<00:02:44.920> which

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
dispenser which drops the skeleton which

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.590 
dispenser which drops the skeleton which
you<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.370> kill<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.850> if<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.300> didn't<00:02:46.450> get<00:02:46.570> a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you can kill and if you didn't get a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.200 
you can kill and if you didn't get a
bone<00:02:46.780> from<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.320> skeleton<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:47.770> could<00:02:47.980> just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
bone from a skeleton you could just

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.430 
bone from a skeleton you could just
trust<00:02:49.210> again<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.780> would<00:02:49.870> drop<00:02:50.080> another

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
trust again and it would drop another

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.260 
trust again and it would drop another
one<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.770> there<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.880> keep<00:02:52.000> killing

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
one in there so you can keep killing

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.730 
one in there so you can keep killing
skeletons<00:02:52.690> until<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.050> finally<00:02:53.260> get<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.590> bone

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
skeletons until you finally get the bone

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.280 
skeletons until you finally get the bone
once<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.580> get<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.850> bone<00:02:55.030> that's<00:02:55.930> when<00:02:56.170> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
once you get the bone that's when the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.760 
once you get the bone that's when the
chain<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.830> events<00:02:57.100> happens<00:02:57.670> words<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:59.440> gives

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
chain of events happens words it gives

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.500 
chain of events happens words it gives
you<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> XP<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.580> everything's<00:03:00.850> like<00:03:01.030> reset

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you the XP and everything's like reset

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.450 
you the XP and everything's like reset
and<00:03:01.690> whatnot<00:03:02.250> here<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.610> comparator

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
and whatnot here is the comparator

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.880 
and whatnot here is the comparator
really<00:03:06.460> hard<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.700> get<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:06.910> there<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.240> this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
really hard to get in there for this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
really hard to get in there for this
comparators<00:03:08.890> right<00:03:09.190> here<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:12.520> hoppers

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
comparators right here the hoppers

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.430 
comparators right here the hoppers
filled<00:03:13.150> with<00:03:13.270> eight<00:03:13.420> one<00:03:13.690> more<00:03:13.840> bone<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.290> then

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
filled with eight one more bone and then

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.200 
filled with eight one more bone and then
it<00:03:14.530> has<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> single<00:03:14.980> strength<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.460> two<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.000> once

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
it has a single strength of two so once

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.330 
it has a single strength of two so once
you<00:03:16.300> put<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.510> extra<00:03:16.780> bone<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.140> there<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:18.160> bone

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
you put the extra bone in there the bone

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.070 
you put the extra bone in there the bone
won't<00:03:18.580> get<00:03:19.000> immediately<00:03:19.420> sucked<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.900> because

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
won't get immediately sucked in because

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.170 
won't get immediately sucked in because
it's<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.500> trap<00:03:20.709> chef<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.160> he's<00:03:21.550> receiving<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's a trap chef so he's receiving a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.410 
it's a trap chef so he's receiving a
power<00:03:22.360> once<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.170> close<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.500> chest<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.420> the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
power once you close the chest and the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.500 
power once you close the chest and the
bone<00:03:25.570> will<00:03:25.750> go<00:03:25.870> into<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.290> hopper<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.510> will

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
bone will go into the hopper and will

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.449 
bone will go into the hopper and will
send<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.780> signal<00:03:28.930> too<00:03:29.590> strong<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.070> finally<00:03:30.340> get

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
send a signal too strong to finally get

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.160 
send a signal too strong to finally get
to<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:30.640> repeater<00:03:30.970> once<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.810> gets<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.020> this

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
to this repeater once it gets to this

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.500 
to this repeater once it gets to this
repeater<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.770> goes<00:03:33.040> into<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.670> repeater

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
repeater it goes into this repeater

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.810 
repeater it goes into this repeater
which<00:03:35.080> resets<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.340> pushes<00:03:36.700> this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
which resets this so it pushes this

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.550 
which resets this so it pushes this
block<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.300> updates<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.870> again<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.290> pushes

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
block and updates this again and pushes

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.010 
block and updates this again and pushes
his<00:03:38.650> block<00:03:38.830> back<00:03:39.040> into<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.459> lights<00:03:39.640> turn<00:03:39.910> on

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
his block back into the lights turn on

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.510 
his block back into the lights turn on
same<00:03:41.020> thing<00:03:41.050> on<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.380> other<00:03:41.440> side<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.250> then<00:03:42.430> it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
same thing on the other side and then it

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.729 
same thing on the other side and then it
comes<00:03:42.700> up<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.270> here<00:03:43.480> what's<00:03:43.840> pushing<00:03:44.170> this

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
comes up to here what's pushing this

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.620 
comes up to here what's pushing this
block<00:03:45.100> out<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.640> another<00:03:45.850> skeleton<00:03:46.090> says<00:03:46.510> it's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
block out so another skeleton says it's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.740 
block out so another skeleton says it's
not<00:03:46.780> spawn<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:48.310> can't<00:03:48.520> you<00:03:49.300> can't<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.660> this

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
not spawn you can't you can't do this

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.360 
not spawn you can't you can't do this
question<00:03:50.020> again<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.500> pushes<00:03:50.800> this<00:03:51.010> block

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
question again so it pushes this block

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.810 
question again so it pushes this block
out<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:52.330> delay<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.930> lost<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.980> Foley<00:03:54.640> will

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
out the delay is lost and the Foley will

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.040 
out the delay is lost and the Foley will
come<00:03:55.000> up<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.360> then<00:03:55.480> what<00:03:55.660> we'll<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.810> nowhere

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
come up and then what we'll have nowhere

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.920 
come up and then what we'll have nowhere
to<00:03:56.200> go<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.350> just<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.800> shorted<00:03:57.700> out<00:03:57.790> what<00:03:58.540> also

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
to go and just get shorted out what also

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.750 
to go and just get shorted out what also
what<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> also<00:03:59.470> need<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.739> do<00:03:59.860> was<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.190> wanted<00:04:00.220> I

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
what I also need to do was I wanted I

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.520 
what I also need to do was I wanted I
didn't<00:04:01.090> want<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.330> signal<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.840> be<00:04:01.959> forever<00:04:02.260> on

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
didn't want this signal to be forever on

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.400 
out I did this thing three times and
I'll<00:04:21.640> loop<00:04:21.910> back<00:04:22.120> around<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.570> we<00:04:22.840> get<00:04:22.990> reset

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
I'll loop back around and we get reset

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.010 
I'll loop back around and we get reset
so<00:04:24.010> it's<00:04:24.160> always<00:04:24.460> gonna<00:04:24.760> stay<00:04:25.120> at<00:04:25.240> 18<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.870> the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
so it's always gonna stay at 18 and the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.810 
so it's always gonna stay at 18 and the
bones<00:04:26.260> gonna

one bomb only that's so then

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.510 
one bomb only that's so then
everything's<00:04:30.220> reset<00:04:30.700> how<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.600> did<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> door<00:04:32.200> is

no signal coming through this basically

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.790 
no signal coming through this basically
pushing<00:04:45.090> keeping<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.210> on<00:04:46.480> which<00:04:47.440> goes<00:04:47.650> down

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
pushing keeping this on which goes down

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.140 
pushing keeping this on which goes down
