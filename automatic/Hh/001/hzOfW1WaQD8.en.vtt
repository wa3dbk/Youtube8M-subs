ten<00:00:11.270> years<00:00:11.300> ago<00:00:11.660> I<00:00:11.930> started<00:00:12.560> to<00:00:13.010> get<00:00:13.550> involved

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
ten years ago I started to get involved

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.439 
ten years ago I started to get involved
in<00:00:15.340> water<00:00:16.340> research<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.510> I<00:00:17.900> became<00:00:18.740> very

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
in water research and I became very

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.529 
in water research and I became very
that's<00:00:20.449> a<00:00:20.720> conscious<00:00:21.520> about<00:00:22.520> the<00:00:23.000> the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
that's a conscious about the the

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.550 
that's a conscious about the the
relationship<00:00:24.410> between<00:00:24.529> water<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.539> mankind

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
relationship between water and mankind

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.410 
relationship between water and mankind
yeah<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.859> problem<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.279> that<00:00:28.310> i<00:00:28.609> was<00:00:28.970> i<00:00:29.240> was

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
yeah so the problem is that i was i was

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.650 
yeah so the problem is that i was i was
talking<00:00:29.869> about<00:00:29.990> water<00:00:30.380> about<00:00:30.859> about<00:00:31.460> how<00:00:31.699> bad

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
talking about water about about how bad

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.389 
talking about water about about how bad
these<00:00:33.109> the<00:00:33.909> water<00:00:34.909> quality<00:00:35.179> in<00:00:35.899> cities<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:36.649> i

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
these the water quality in cities and i

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.450 
these the water quality in cities and i
had<00:00:37.609> no<00:00:38.050> solution<00:00:39.050> to<00:00:41.620> propose<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:43.219> tell

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
had no solution to propose to to tell

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.399 
had no solution to propose to to tell
people<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.859> I<00:00:45.859> looked<00:00:46.549> for<00:00:46.940> any<00:00:47.809> kind<00:00:48.199> of

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
people so I I looked for any kind of

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.509 
people so I I looked for any kind of
solution<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.219> what<00:00:50.149> came<00:00:51.129> very<00:00:52.129> clearly

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
solution and what came very clearly

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.660 
solution and what came very clearly
after<00:00:52.819> a<00:00:53.089> while<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:53.929> the<00:00:54.289> filtration<00:00:55.219> was

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
after a while is that the filtration was

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.459 
after a while is that the filtration was
the<00:00:56.389> only<00:00:56.780> option<00:00:57.049> that<00:00:57.319> at<00:00:57.709> at<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:58.609> moment

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
the only option that at at the moment

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.329 
the only option that at at the moment
and<00:01:00.469> I<00:01:00.859> came<00:01:01.190> with<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.760> first<00:01:02.149> drawing<00:01:03.339> first

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
and I came with the first drawing first

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.110 
and I came with the first drawing first
sketch<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:05.690> what<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.530> known<00:01:06.980> today<00:01:07.190> as<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.640> ova

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
years and a half of research and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.680 
years and a half of research and
development<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.870> little<00:01:18.500> more<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:19.850> got

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
development a little more and I got

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.460
