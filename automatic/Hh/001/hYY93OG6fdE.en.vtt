when<00:00:04.420> a<00:00:04.450> recipe<00:00:04.870> calls<00:00:05.140> for<00:00:05.319> tamarind<00:00:05.979> juice

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
when a recipe calls for tamarind juice

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.610 
when a recipe calls for tamarind juice
or<00:00:06.550> tamarind<00:00:06.939> paste<00:00:07.180> some<00:00:08.020> of<00:00:08.139> us<00:00:08.260> are<00:00:08.440> lucky

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
or tamarind paste some of us are lucky

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.949 
or tamarind paste some of us are lucky
enough<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:08.950> find<00:00:09.100> ones<00:00:09.969> that<00:00:10.150> are<00:00:10.240> ready<00:00:10.780> to

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:10.959 
enough to find ones that are ready to

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.680 
enough to find ones that are ready to
use<00:00:11.139> in<00:00:11.349> a<00:00:11.440> jar<00:00:11.769> while<00:00:12.519> some<00:00:12.849> of<00:00:12.969> us<00:00:13.059> are<00:00:13.360> faced

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
use in a jar while some of us are faced

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.589 
use in a jar while some of us are faced
with<00:00:14.050> something<00:00:14.740> like<00:00:14.889> this<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.480> do

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
with something like this what to do

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.480 
with something like this what to do
because<00:00:16.869> it<00:00:17.080> never<00:00:17.349> comes<00:00:17.650> with<00:00:17.890> instructions

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
because it never comes with instructions

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.030 
because it never comes with instructions
so<00:00:19.329> here's<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.140> lesson<00:00:20.349> for<00:00:20.529> you

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
so here's a lesson for you

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.819 
so here's a lesson for you
this<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.460> tamarind<00:00:22.029> flesh<00:00:22.930> that's<00:00:23.500> been

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
this is tamarind flesh that's been

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.909 
this is tamarind flesh that's been
seeded<00:00:24.369> and<00:00:24.550> compressed<00:00:25.210> into<00:00:25.509> a<00:00:25.930> block<00:00:26.290> now

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
seeded and compressed into a block now

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.150 
seeded and compressed into a block now
tarrant<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:28.720> fruit<00:00:29.200> that<00:00:29.230> looks<00:00:29.470> like<00:00:29.829> this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
tarrant is a fruit that looks like this

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.270 
tarrant is a fruit that looks like this
it<00:00:30.579> has<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.849> consistency<00:00:31.779> very<00:00:32.619> much<00:00:32.920> similar

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
it has a consistency very much similar

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.260 
it has a consistency very much similar
to<00:00:33.820> dates<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.980> open<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.460> up<00:00:36.550> like<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:38.310> so<00:00:39.310> so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
to dates you open it up like this so so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.390 
to dates you open it up like this so so
it's<00:00:40.360> very<00:00:40.480> similar<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.900> dates<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.560> it<00:00:41.650> ranges

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
it's very similar to dates and it ranges

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.290 
it's very similar to dates and it ranges
from<00:00:42.700> being<00:00:42.940> very<00:00:43.570> sour<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:45.040> very<00:00:45.280> sweet<00:00:45.940> and

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
from being very sour to very sweet and

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.170 
from being very sour to very sweet and
the<00:00:46.780> seeds<00:00:47.050> are<00:00:47.290> all<00:00:47.440> inside<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> seeds

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
the seeds are all inside so the seeds

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.790 
the seeds are all inside so the seeds
have<00:00:49.360> been<00:00:49.480> removed<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.230> this<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.590> what<00:00:50.740> we

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
have been removed and so this is what we

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.240 
have been removed and so this is what we
get<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.190> is<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.370> very<00:00:51.640> sour<00:00:52.200> variety<00:00:53.200> so<00:00:54.100> what

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
get this is a very sour variety so what

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.200 
get this is a very sour variety so what
we're<00:00:54.340> going<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.489> do<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.790> I'm<00:00:54.880> going<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.030> take

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
we're going to do is I'm going to take

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
we're going to do is I'm going to take
about<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.750> sixth<00:00:56.590> of<00:00:56.620> this<00:00:57.390> chunk<00:00:58.390> here<00:00:58.840> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
about a sixth of this chunk here and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.540 
about a sixth of this chunk here and
some<00:01:01.840> brands<00:01:02.200> are<00:01:02.560> softer<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.130> easier<00:01:03.340> to

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
some brands are softer and easier to

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.899 
some brands are softer and easier to
handle<00:01:03.640> than<00:01:04.329> others<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:05.610> maybe<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.700> little

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
handle than others and maybe a little

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
handle than others and maybe a little
bit<00:01:07.090> more<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.479> I'm<00:01:07.540> going<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.690> drop<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:08.140> into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bit more and I'm going to drop this into

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.460 
bit more and I'm going to drop this into
water<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.090> just<00:01:10.479> boiled<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.260> very

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
water that I just boiled so this is very

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.380 
water that I just boiled so this is very
hot<00:01:11.740> water<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.340> then<00:01:12.880> we're<00:01:13.060> going<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.210> let

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
hot water and then we're going to let

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.500 
hot water and then we're going to let
this<00:01:13.570> sit<00:01:13.840> for<00:01:13.870> about<00:01:14.050> 15<00:01:14.409> minutes<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.450> let<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
this sit for about 15 minutes to let it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.690 
this sit for about 15 minutes to let it
soften<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.500> loosen<00:01:17.920> up<00:01:18.010> and<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.430> will<00:01:18.549> come

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
soften and loosen up and it will come

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.480 
soften and loosen up and it will come
back<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.330> second<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:21.070> it's<00:01:21.280> been

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
back to it in a second so it's been

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.969 
back to it in a second so it's been
about<00:01:21.640> 15<00:01:22.210> minutes<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.930> so<00:01:23.170> if<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.770> want<00:01:23.920> to

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
about 15 minutes and so if you want to

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.890 
about 15 minutes and so if you want to
look<00:01:24.130> at<00:01:24.310> our<00:01:24.460> tamarind<00:01:25.060> block<00:01:25.299> here<00:01:25.659> it's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
look at our tamarind block here it's

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.690 
look at our tamarind block here it's
light<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.320> color<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.890> looks<00:01:27.070> loosened<00:01:27.580> up

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
light in color and it looks loosened up

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.780 
light in color and it looks loosened up
and<00:01:27.970> really<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.690> can<00:01:29.130> soak<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.310> as<00:01:30.400> long<00:01:30.610> as

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
and really you can soak it as long as

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.030 
and really you can soak it as long as
you<00:01:30.909> want<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.299> goal<00:01:31.600> here<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.470> soften<00:01:32.770> it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
you want the goal here is to soften it

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.789 
you want the goal here is to soften it
up<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:34.000> then<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:35.290> in<00:01:35.470> with<00:01:35.500> your

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
up so that you can then go in with your

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.260 
up so that you can then go in with your
hand<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.549> then<00:01:37.420> smoosh<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:40.000> you're<00:01:40.119> just

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
hand and then smoosh it and you're just

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.950 
hand and then smoosh it and you're just
gonna<00:01:40.390> keep<00:01:40.720> doing<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.140> until<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:42.960> pretty

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
gonna keep doing this until you pretty

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.109 
gonna keep doing this until you pretty
much<00:01:44.130> feel<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:45.340> there's<00:01:45.520> nothing<00:01:45.760> anymore

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
much feel like there's nothing anymore

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.280 
much feel like there's nothing anymore
to<00:01:46.420> smoosh<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.369> this<00:01:48.580> has<00:01:48.729> been<00:01:48.939> well<00:01:49.450> squeezed

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
to smoosh so this has been well squeezed

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.219 
to smoosh so this has been well squeezed
out<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.030> wanted<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.299> also<00:01:52.659> say<00:01:53.049> that

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
out and I just wanted to also say that

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.730 
out and I just wanted to also say that
there's<00:01:53.380> really<00:01:53.680> no<00:01:54.750> ratio<00:01:55.750> how<00:01:56.229> much<00:01:56.439> water

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
there's really no ratio how much water

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.910 
there's really no ratio how much water
exactly<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.700> enough<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.090> cover<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.680> so

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
exactly just enough to cover it and so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.969 
exactly just enough to cover it and so
when<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.250> cook<00:02:01.560> now<00:02:02.560> we're<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:02.920> to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
when you cook now we're just going to

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.789 
when you cook now we're just going to
strain<00:02:03.310> out<00:02:03.460> all<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.790> fiber<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.570> seeds<00:02:05.049> when

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
strain out all the fiber and seeds when

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.559 
strain out all the fiber and seeds when
you<00:02:05.979> cook<00:02:07.019> it's<00:02:08.019> always<00:02:08.409> important<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:08.950> taste

you make it it's always going to be a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.970 
you make it it's always going to be a
little<00:02:13.200> bit<00:02:13.290> different<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.819> that's<00:02:14.969> okay<00:02:15.359> if

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
little bit different and that's okay if

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.860 
little bit different and that's okay if
you<00:02:16.980> buy<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.459> ready-made<00:02:17.969> one<00:02:18.329> generally

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's going to be a lot thicker than this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's going to be a lot thicker than this
so<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:21.989> generally<00:02:22.349> use<00:02:22.379> less<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:25.290> a

big deal the more water you use the

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.379 
big deal the more water you use the
easier<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.889> to<00:02:28.980> make<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.670> juice<00:02:30.000> because

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
if you make it really thick it becomes a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.509 
if you make it really thick it becomes a
lot<00:02:35.609> harder<00:02:35.669> to<00:02:36.569> mix<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.019> together<00:02:37.169> so<00:02:37.650> and
