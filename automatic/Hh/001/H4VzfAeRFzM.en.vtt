00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 years after we saw the nana 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.670
 collective laundry is not just a team 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.820
 have converted our button and yes because of that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 sawing a where there is imminent 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 described after the switch 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 team eyes see from 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.300
 yes now it has been enough again 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.439
 must simply want to do our thing 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 after show too 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 yes, because it was perhaps the most difficult 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.050
 half of this season so far 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 yes come on we will certainly go a lot too 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 more difficult to come by but keep 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.700
 yes it was not just half ours 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.840
 could do were often under pressure 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 put 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.469
 how the new season is not easy 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.789
 club easy may top club no yes it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.260
 is just a good club 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.690
 show in the jupiter that I therefore 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 they also came to the premier league 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 but yes they show well whatever they do 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 being able 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 yes they have a hard time in our ears 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 just it doesn't happen more often than the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.710
 defender during the first team 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.229
 is changed then there must actually be 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.580
 not so country are so difficult to start 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.020
 for you to say something about that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.850
 I have the idea that you will be tonight 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.260
 maybe it played in my steam 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 have 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 but that is not too green 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 must have had us two to prove 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630
 training also shows the biggest thing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 I leave my tanks in, so lie there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.119
 just a trainer 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 our gombe must be there for each 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 match against trainer look after one 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 match he can just go to several 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 so I also go to the training this would 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 do not let what I did well 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.189
 I mainly show that I have one 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.930
 basic place of 10 what do I just have to mind 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.250
 shows on training sessions and 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.690
 and home games that you have today 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 done then the summer can be the in one 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.410
 a few months ago on Monday evening 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.480
 play your match on the third run and 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.240
 Tuesday night here at the Philips stadium 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.520
 against ac milan for the champions league 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.410
 yes right there is a big step me 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.310
 have made one has how many 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.230
 give power 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.730
 well i did not trust back 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.050
 give to show what he is 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.540
 everything is possible 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 ah kind of it also what you what you someone 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.080
 you must also be able to take back 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.850
 to what extent are you now one 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.030
 other footballer than the past 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 season 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.560
 I think I have made a big step 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.200
 what I have seen in recent years 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.630
 have a better footballer gods trainers 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 also helped a lot in that but I got myself 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.470
 developed further 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 yes then I have to keep doing that nice 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.320
 in me a typical defending that 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.540
 rather to the opponent's goal 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.070
 looks through but his own goal while 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 you have on defenders that exactly 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.350
 the other way around of course that are for 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.380
 my qualities come on film 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.650
 whoever I saw focused on how I just got 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.450
 even though said yes i do not like until the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.670
 attack behind me and then I afterwards one 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.670
 And so yes I will continue to care
