you<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.820> blast<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you just blast this thing you just see a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
you just blast this thing you just see a
giant<00:01:31.979> blue<00:01:32.520> laser<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.659> head

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
right now you see a laser just fly at

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
right now you see a laser just fly at
this<00:01:36.479> enemy<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.320> turn<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:37.979> dust

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
this enemy and just turn them into dust

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.679 
this enemy and just turn them into dust
because<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> gauss<00:01:38.670> rifle<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.150> strong<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
because the gauss rifle as strong as it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
because the gauss rifle as strong as it
is<00:01:39.780> usually<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.680> shot<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> upper

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
is usually like a one shot on the upper
body<00:01:41.780> depending<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.899> difficulty<00:01:43.350> you're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
body depending on difficulty you're

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
body depending on difficulty you're
playing<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.310> imagine<00:01:44.610> charging<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
playing on but imagine charging that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.690 
playing on but imagine charging that
thing<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.170> obliterate<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.280> super

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
thing up and just obliterate a super

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.039 
thing up and just obliterate a super
mutant<00:01:48.000> master<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.570> something<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
mutant master or something like that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.410 
mutant master or something like that
that<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.189> sick<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.299> add

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that would be sick and that would add

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
that would be sick and that would add
some<00:01:51.659> death<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.189> waste

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
some death like you know you like waste

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.830 
some death like you know you like waste
a<00:01:53.610> ton<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> em<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.479> sure<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> gauss

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
a ton of em I'm pretty sure the gauss

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
a ton of em I'm pretty sure the gauss
rifle<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> one-shot<00:01:55.649> thing<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:56.490> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 
rifle is a one-shot thing so maybe like
I<00:01:57.000> waste<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.869> three<00:01:58.110> rounds<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I waste two or three rounds on this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
I waste two or three rounds on this
thing<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.759> i<00:01:59.790> did<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> charge<00:02:00.420> shot
