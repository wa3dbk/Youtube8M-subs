to's and we've been looking at the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.630 
to's and we've been looking at the
camera<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> want<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.160> look<00:00:20.400> at

camera and right now I want to look at

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.269 
camera and right now I want to look at
selective<00:00:21.240> focus<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.900> touched<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

just go over it again with you
selective<00:00:29.010> focus<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.449> let<00:00:30.779> me

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
selective focus is right here let me

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160 
selective focus is right here let me
just<00:00:31.080> put<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> prop<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.989> we're<00:00:34.110> now

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
just put a prop here so we're now

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.330 
just put a prop here so we're now
looking<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> white<00:00:34.739> screen<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.980> tap<00:00:38.190> on

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
looking at a white screen and you tap on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.799 
looking at a white screen and you tap on
this<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.629> into

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this right here and it goes into

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.229 
this right here and it goes into
selective<00:00:40.350> focus<00:00:40.710> mode<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.059> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
selective focus mode now they want you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
selective focus mode now they want you
to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.629> one-and-a-half<00:00:43.230> feet<00:00:43.260> away<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to be one-and-a-half feet away from the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.180 
to be one-and-a-half feet away from the
subject<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.700> seems<00:00:44.969> weird<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> they've

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
subject which seems weird and they've

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
subject which seems weird and they've
got<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> backgrounds<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.450> three

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
got if the backgrounds got to be three

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
got if the backgrounds got to be three
times<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.800> four<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> half

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
times at this and so four and a half

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
times at this and so four and a half
feet<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.730> whatever<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> background<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
feet or whatever in the background of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
feet or whatever in the background of
course<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.579> further<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.360> then

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
course it can be much further and then

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
course it can be much further and then
you<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.289> ahead<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.649> take<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> photo<00:00:56.550> now

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you just go ahead and take the photo now

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
you just go ahead and take the photo now
it's<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> work<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> because

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's not going to work in this because

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's not going to work in this because
it<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.620> no<00:00:58.890> depth<00:00:59.250> behind<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.329> object

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it really is no depth behind the object

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.000 
it really is no depth behind the object
but<00:01:01.020> I'll<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.289> ahead<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> picture

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
but I'll go ahead and take the picture

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.450 
but I'll go ahead and take the picture
and<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.260> takes<00:01:04.500> usually<00:01:04.769> longer

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and actually it takes usually longer

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
and actually it takes usually longer
when<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.360> depth<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.350> it's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
when it when there is depth because it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
when it when there is depth because it's
got<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> process<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.939> takes<00:01:09.150> maybe<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
got a process it you know takes maybe a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780 
got a process it you know takes maybe a
few<00:01:09.750> seconds<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.549> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
few seconds so I'm going to go in here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
few seconds so I'm going to go in here
to<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.150> photo<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> I'll<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.170> quickly

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to this photo and I'll just go quickly

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649 
to this photo and I'll just go quickly
delete<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.640> once<00:01:14.850> you've<00:01:15.000> created<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.450> photo

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
delete it so once you've created a photo

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
delete it so once you've created a photo
what<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.259> happen<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.939> any<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
what will happen is any of these that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.010 
what will happen is any of these that
you<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:22.490> depth<00:01:23.630> here's<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.840> right

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you have the the depth here's one right

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.370 
you have the the depth here's one right
here

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.700 
here
of<00:01:26.450> yips<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.689> maybe<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.020> yo-yo<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.380> can't

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of yips or maybe it's yo-yo I can't

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090 
of yips or maybe it's yo-yo I can't
remember<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> trees

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
remember which as you can see the trees

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.620 
remember which as you can see the trees
in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> background<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.939> its<00:01:33.090> icon

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
in the background you can see its icon

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.219 
in the background you can see its icon
go<00:01:34.409> ahead<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.680> select<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> icon<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
go ahead and select this icon you have

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
go ahead and select this icon you have
you<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.799> near<00:01:37.979> focus<00:01:38.400> far<00:01:38.640> focus<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> pan

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you have near focus far focus and pan

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
you have near focus far focus and pan
focus<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.380> pan<00:01:40.590> focus<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.100> brings<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> back

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
focus now pan focus just brings it back

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
focus now pan focus just brings it back
to<00:01:41.729> normal<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> background<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> clear<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to normal the background is clear and so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030 
to normal the background is clear and so
is<00:01:43.890> he<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.390> put<00:01:45.899> near<00:01:46.140> focus<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> where

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
is he if I put near focus which is where

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
is he if I put near focus which is where
it<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.310> from<00:01:47.670> by<00:01:47.850> default<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.479> puts<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it was from by default it puts the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.319 
it was from by default it puts the
background<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> focus<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
background out of focus and then of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
background out of focus and then of
course<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.049> guessed<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.829> him

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
course this you guessed it will put him

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.030 
course this you guessed it will put him
out<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> focus<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> particular<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.829> what

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
out of focus in this particular one what

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
out of focus in this particular one what
you<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:56.610> you've<00:01:56.759> selected<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.630> if

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you do is when you've selected it if

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
you do is when you've selected it if
this<00:01:58.500> isn't<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.700> shot<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this isn't like in shot more when you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
this isn't like in shot more when you
save<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> photo<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.469> goes<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> studio<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
save a photo in goes to the studio you

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.069 
save a photo in goes to the studio you
actually<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.899> hit<00:02:04.079> done<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:06.180> done<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
actually just hit done and it's done and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
actually just hit done and it's done and
you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.409> always<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.220> change<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you can always go back and change it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.119 
you can always go back and change it
which<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> cool<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.440> leaves<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.979> as

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
which is cool but it just leaves it as

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.960 
which is cool but it just leaves it as
as<00:02:11.520> whatever<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.180> left<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
as whatever you left it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.570 
as whatever you left it
so<00:02:13.600> that's<00:02:14.290> pretty<00:02:14.590> much<00:02:14.680> what<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.460> look

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
so that's pretty much what it would look

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.550 
so that's pretty much what it would look
like<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:16.120> think<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:18.210> another<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.560> here

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
like I think I have another one here

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
like I think I have another one here
here's<00:02:20.860> another<00:02:21.070> one<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.400> my<00:02:21.520> son<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.180> house

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
here's another one of my son and a house

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.350 
here's another one of my son and a house
in<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.570> background<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.520> doesn't<00:02:25.240> look

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
in the background this one doesn't look

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.420 
in the background this one doesn't look
good<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:26.260> other<00:02:26.380> problem<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.770> have<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.190> think

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
good the other problem I have is I think

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430 
good the other problem I have is I think
you've<00:02:27.940> got<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.300> have<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> steady<00:02:28.780> object<00:02:29.290> so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you've got to have a steady object so

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.100 
you've got to have a steady object so
kids<00:02:29.740> tough<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.340> do<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.700> had<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.360> try<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> bunch<00:02:31.900> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
kids tough to do I had to try a bunch of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.350 
kids tough to do I had to try a bunch of
times<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.560> get<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.070> work<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.460> would<00:02:33.580> say<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
times to get it to work it would say it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.570 
times to get it to work it would say it
doesn't<00:02:34.630> recognize<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.800> object<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.460> it's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
doesn't recognize the object and it's

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
doesn't recognize the object and it's
like<00:02:36.730> what<00:02:36.850> are<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:36.970> talking<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.450> he's

right in front of me but and I did have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.850 
right in front of me but and I did have
some<00:02:40.930> problems<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.350> if<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.620> somebody

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
who's steady it works or even just an

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.070 
who's steady it works or even just an
object<00:02:44.530> works<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.480> could<00:02:46.630> saw<00:02:46.750> with<00:02:46.960> the

object works as you could saw with the
yips<00:02:47.260> there<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.030> pan<00:02:49.360> focus<00:02:49.780> I'll<00:02:49.930> take

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
much but I'll put the near focus you see

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.750 
much but I'll put the near focus you see
it<00:02:54.340> went<00:02:54.580> out<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.510> course<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.870> far<00:02:56.080> focus

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
in his face so I can just leave it there

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.230 
in his face so I can just leave it there
and<00:03:01.900> hit<00:03:02.020> done<00:03:02.260> now<00:03:02.770> here's<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.400> thing<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
and hit done now here's the thing you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.210 
and hit done now here's the thing you
gotta<00:03:04.480> know<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:04.960> you're<00:03:05.230> gonna<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:05.860> and

gotta know that you're gonna do this and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.670 
gotta know that you're gonna do this and
hit<00:03:06.490> selective<00:03:06.940> focus<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.020> there<00:03:08.440> are

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
hit selective focus but there are

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.160 
hit selective focus but there are
situations<00:03:09.040> where<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.970> do<00:03:10.120> take<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.360> photo<00:03:10.720> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
situations where you do take a photo and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.590 
situations where you do take a photo and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
you can do this after the fact when you

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.330 
you can do this after the fact when you
didn't<00:03:13.900> select<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.860> completely

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
didn't select it it's a completely

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.670 
didn't select it it's a completely
different<00:03:15.670> option<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.600> I'm<00:03:17.320> going<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> show

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
different option and I'm going to show

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.370 
different option and I'm going to show
you<00:03:17.739> an<00:03:17.890> example<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:19.050> in<00:03:20.050> this<00:03:20.140> particular

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
you an example of it in this particular

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.210 
you an example of it in this particular
photo<00:03:20.950> here<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.090> just<00:03:22.120> took<00:03:22.890> there<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.040> no

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
photo here that I just took there is no

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
photo here that I just took there is no
icon<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.940> did<00:03:25.239> not<00:03:25.270> use<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.810> selective

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
icon so I did not use the selective

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.820 
icon so I did not use the selective
focus<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.670> what<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.000> would<00:03:28.180> do<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.630> tap<00:03:29.590> right

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
can see the background went out of focus

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.660 
can see the background went out of focus
and<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:44.950> particular<00:03:45.280> situation

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.030 
and in this particular situation
actually<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.480> can<00:03:46.630> adjust<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.200> by<00:03:47.739> sliding

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
actually you can adjust it by sliding

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.949 
actually you can adjust it by sliding
your<00:03:48.340> finger<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.820> see<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.450> bar<00:03:49.660> there

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
your finger you can see the bar there

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.530 
your finger you can see the bar there
going<00:03:50.410> how<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.489> can<00:03:51.700> leave<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.090> this

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
going how much so I can leave it this

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.290 
going how much so I can leave it this
much<00:03:52.810> or<00:03:53.440> leave<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.739> whatever<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:54.580> when

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
much or leave it whatever and then when

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.400 
much or leave it whatever and then when
you<00:03:55.450> hit<00:03:55.630> done<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:58.330> actually<00:03:58.570> will<00:03:58.840> save<00:03:59.170> this

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
you hit done you actually will save this

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.990 
you hit done you actually will save this
this<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.800> little<00:04:00.100> difference<00:04:00.580> going<00:04:00.790> back

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
this is a little difference going back

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.130 
this is a little difference going back
to<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.300> studio<00:04:01.720> you'll<00:04:02.380> save<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:03.010> image

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
to that studio you'll save this image

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.479 
to that studio you'll save this image
it'll<00:04:05.140> keep<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.650> original<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.130> can<00:04:06.250> do<00:04:06.340> high

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
it'll keep the original you can do high

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.880 
it'll keep the original you can do high
quality<00:04:06.519> or<00:04:07.060> good<00:04:07.239> quality<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.989> it<00:04:08.590> will<00:04:08.680> keep

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
quality or good quality and it will keep

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.270 
quality or good quality and it will keep
the<00:04:09.100> original<00:04:09.580> intact<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.320> exit<00:04:11.950> out<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.100> that

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
the original intact so exit out of that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.020 
the original intact so exit out of that
and<00:04:12.730> if<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.830> go<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.100> main<00:04:15.640> part<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:15.940> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
and if I go to the main part of the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.870 
and if I go to the main part of the
gallery<00:04:16.239> go<00:04:17.019> into<00:04:17.200> studio<00:04:17.650> there's<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.669> photo

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
gallery go into studio there's the photo

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.230 
gallery go into studio there's the photo
there<00:04:19.330> that<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.049> saved<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.880> that's<00:04:22.090> how

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
doesn't really focus much let me see if

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.280 
doesn't really focus much let me see if
I<00:04:47.720> can<00:04:47.900> find<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.770> know<00:04:49.700> there's<00:04:50.060> one<00:04:50.240> here<00:04:50.600> where

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
I can find I know there's one here where

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.780 
I can find I know there's one here where
it<00:04:51.410> didn't<00:04:51.740> work<00:04:55.180> maybe<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.390> this<00:04:56.540> one<00:04:57.790> so

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
it didn't work maybe it's this one so

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.740 
it didn't work maybe it's this one so
let's<00:04:59.720> try<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.080> portrait<00:05:00.910> yeah<00:05:01.910> face<00:05:02.360> no<00:05:02.720> face

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
let's try it portrait yeah face no face

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.480 
let's try it portrait yeah face no face
detected<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.620> mean<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.830> face<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.160> right<00:05:04.310> there

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
detected I mean the face is right there

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.800 
detected I mean the face is right there
maybe<00:05:04.669> it's<00:05:04.880> because<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> eyes<00:05:05.450> weren't

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
maybe it's because the eyes weren't

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.260 
maybe it's because the eyes weren't
detected<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.590> don't<00:05:07.160> know<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.760> other<00:05:07.880> thing<00:05:08.120> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
detected I don't know the other thing is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.060 
detected I don't know the other thing is
it's<00:05:08.480> got<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.750> be<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.020> face<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.560> can't<00:05:09.770> be<00:05:09.950> an

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
it's got to be a face it can't be an

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.210 
it's got to be a face it can't be an
object<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.790> tried<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.630> actually<00:05:12.169> with<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.620> yips

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
object I tried it actually with the yips

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.790 
object I tried it actually with the yips
or<00:05:13.460> yo-yo<00:05:13.790> whatever<00:05:14.120> his<00:05:14.240> name<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.620> as<00:05:15.620> an

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
or yo-yo whatever his name is as an

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.980 
or yo-yo whatever his name is as an
object<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.730> didn't<00:05:17.090> recognize<00:05:17.630> it

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
object and it didn't recognize it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.940 
object and it didn't recognize it
so<00:05:18.560> that's<00:05:18.830> pretty<00:05:19.070> much<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.310> that's<00:05:20.950> the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
so that's pretty much it that's the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.530 
so that's pretty much it that's the
selective<00:05:22.460> focus<00:05:22.669> works<00:05:23.630> pretty<00:05:24.200> cool<00:05:25.540> when

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
selective focus works pretty cool when

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.450 
selective focus works pretty cool when
it<00:05:26.660> does<00:05:26.840> work<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.800> does<00:05:28.190> take<00:05:28.430> a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
it does work but it is does take a

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.140 
it does work but it is does take a
little<00:05:28.669> bit<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.940> trial<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.330> error<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:31.120> give<00:05:32.120> it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
little bit of trial and error so give it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.950 
little bit of trial and error so give it
a<00:05:32.300> shot<00:05:32.330> selective<00:05:33.110> focus<00:05:33.290> on<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.830> galaxy<00:05:34.340> s5

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
a shot selective focus on the galaxy s5

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.630 
a shot selective focus on the galaxy s5
