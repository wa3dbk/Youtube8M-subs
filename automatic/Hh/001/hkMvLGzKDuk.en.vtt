seasoning<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.809> like

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

it's<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> toy<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's very good but it's not a toy the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219 
it's very good but it's not a toy the
only<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:09.060> could<00:01:09.240> say<00:01:09.390> sometimes<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
only thing I could say sometimes the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899 
only thing I could say sometimes the

I<00:01:11.940> guess<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.570> balance<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.170> age<00:01:13.350> it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I guess the balance that age it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.969 
I guess the balance that age it's
necessary<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.460> guess<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.930> most<00:01:16.110> footprint

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
necessary I guess the most footprint

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.889 
necessary I guess the most footprint
work<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.580> common<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.450> says<00:01:18.659> how<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
work we have common into it says how we
