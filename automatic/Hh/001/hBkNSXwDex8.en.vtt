 left hand 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.979
 equip up common in principle 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 getting enough sleep is not so hard 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.200
 ok enough, and then there is almost already 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 nothing left until you point 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.710
 That means I can say this 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 chat were yes here I am probably week Charlie 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.200

 if not more tea love me still 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.770
 I can’t post a video about what 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.049
 we came see shout can immediately 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.850
 to say with confidence about this tea 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.850
 that he is very good and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 here is this tea and it is natural 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 no friends no no no add no 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.590
 no dyes 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.410
 but accordingly how were such 10 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.420
 It seems very fast because all the same 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.220
 natural the dead weed they all 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.239
 of course brew wonderful 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 absolutely enjoys 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.629
 will simplify quickly and i like a man 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.500
 which does not all sit down and I 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.720
 as a person who still I'm not 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 to not so often answer mostly 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 it is taught in the morning now that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.500
 heat in minnesota that's impossible yes 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.280
 for me all the same probably more important when 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.930
 fresh tea is still less debt 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.130
 and take a look at what's in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.970
 that he is part of the trawl la la la la la da 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.459
 we have a blackberry raspberry mint horsetail 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.579
 juniper cranberries nettle and 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.709
 calendula and still stereo reach a minute 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.629
 what is being done let's remove on 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:14.220
 a place here is worth it now I recently 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.069
 baked cookies according to the recipe will affect 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.010
 the fridge is still hanging 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.920
 so here's the prescription years on m-zari 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.090
 called they get what countries but in 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.350
 Generally see that I was too lazy 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.220
 roll out and cut 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.130
 just the same dough is like 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.769
 crumbling crumbling here and 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.260
 accordingly, they just needed them 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.430
 so sculpt such balls and they go 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.380
 seasoning which is called ribbon and we 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.389
 with my husband long cursed lominsa 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.540
 enamel manatee but in general actually 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.569
 it is not important that these are in Russian 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.730
 although maybe no, I can be mistaken here 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.950
 news but I didn’t really like myself 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.470
 very often put on pizza and so he 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.720
 says that when we go this cookie i 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.380
 I feel like I'm going to eat pizza 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.530
 and the sauce did not give me yes by the way here is like 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.560
 show such a thing this is such a miracle 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.590
 rag yes she we have done with some 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.979
 microfiber and wipes very well 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.690
 let's get a little engine and wipe very 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.210
 well all sorts of here are such surfaces 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.920
 i have some more clean here but 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.530
 he stash in general I do not remember them 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.230
 So they took the liver let mcafee 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.680
 trailing and here it is 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.370
 wipe this here so answer net 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.460
 side 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.810
 and this is her side. 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.190
 somehow 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.700
 scrubbing alignment then scrubbing 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.160
 bits of stone inhabitants are theatrical 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.050
 overall I brought them my old work 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.400
 where no one uses them and so I 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.980
 thought that why shouldn't they 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.930
 recycle and yesterday we are also with mine 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.490
 husband went biotech in our area 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.130
 library thank god there is 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 open until 9 but a few weeks she 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.150
 open until nine until 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.240
 and that means in summer the covenant took just such 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.390

 which I can still ride with of course it 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:30.340
 everything is done right like this 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.210
 it looks like we live here right here in this 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.740
 area and here we have these here our 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.540
