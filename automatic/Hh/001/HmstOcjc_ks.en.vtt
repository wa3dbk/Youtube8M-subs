00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.210
 over fluctuating press go up 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 wire ropes balance sledging 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.500
 and all this at dizzying heights 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.500
 this is possible in the kletterwald munich 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.070
 intern our fk tv has it 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.200
 whole times looked at more closely 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.570
 but before you can go the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.070
 and camerawoman caro from christoph vom 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.330
 climbing forest him with one 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 seat belt and gloves 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.180
 fitted 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.860
 nevertheless one should with the clothes choice 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.690
 to pay attention to one or the other 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.790
 you should have firm footwear but 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.890
 climbs with us and with us it is so 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.120
 that we are rain technically independent 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.590
 so if it rains you can like 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 continue climbing so appropriate 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.030
 Clothes are also good for it too 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.690
 short safety instruction stands up 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.519
 the program 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.360
 christoph gives tips for that 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.010
 right behavior in height 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.170
 special caution is required 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.120
 in the case course actually always if 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.309
 one stops in the pa course one rises if 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.199
 But we have secured ourselves 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 a very elegant security system 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.500
 the maximum one carbine open 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.850
 can and therefore one is forced 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.860
 always with a carbine in the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.030
 deflected safety rope 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.229
 during the briefing the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 Climber with the different ones 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.580
 elements of the course route familiar 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.360
 made at e.on so slowly the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.770
 nervousness 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.150
 So I'm really curious as it is now 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.130
 is equal they would very nice genuine 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.259
 very interesting but that's it 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.549
 then again a very different thing and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.399
 I hope I have no fear of heights but 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.590
 we will find out now 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.670
 and now it can finally start over 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.750
 a head joint pain 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.750
 Starting point of the course 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.100
 here in about eight meters height is next 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.510
 a good balance and sure-footedness 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.480
 especially one thing done 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.760
 dizziness kletterwald mÃ¼nchen 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.650
 is suitable for all people between 8 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.540
 and 85 years and that's the age 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
 what we already had there too 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.170
 A little bit of courage is part of it when you look at yourself 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.420
 thanks to your own security at the same time 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.070
 swinging over the abyss but that is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 not the only challenge 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 I personally find in the first course 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.130
 the bridge in Bobbycar was very funny 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.880
 keep more citizens free on our bridge 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.800
 can drive 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.390
 and for those who are already twelve 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.730
 may climb us in the fourth course 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 there is the major attraction of doing to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.660
 jump where to get off the platform 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.280
 jumps because a large net and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.200
 even if one or the other times 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.550
 is the duty I can go wrong 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
 always catching up and 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.140
 keep going because there is no way 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.360
 has to the aml started the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 make all traffic to end it is 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.040
 because you want from a staff 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.660
 to be saved but by vonn is that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.940
 not necessary and so it reaches the end 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.440
 the goal the first disk costs it 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.850
 Try more so little 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.590
 a bit rumba casual so that makes 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.300
 have a lot of fun and the last to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.489
 have just done that 's it 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.160
 very physically exhausting so that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.209
 is then already from the sports house on 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.350
 The fun has always been the most fun 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.489
 place you go somewhere 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.350
 could rappel 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.030
 or when you're at the bottom of it all 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.840
 exhausting partners and then finally 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.840
 the platform reaches 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.950
 yvonne has the challenge 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.620
 mastered while skill 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.570
 and his courage proved and even once 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 would like to test the vertigo-free 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.950
 can do this regularly 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.560
 for 22 euros there are two and a half hours 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.000
 Climbing fun an experience which is for ours 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000
 Reporter definitely want
