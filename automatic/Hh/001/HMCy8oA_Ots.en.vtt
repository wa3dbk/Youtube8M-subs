00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 there are hung here they want to wow if this one in 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:12.000
 water in this channel if I just left a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 video on the other channel not saying that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.440
 it is better that we follow that channel the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.230
 reasons are in that site the truth is 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.930
 that I was not comfortable with the acceptance 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.770
 that with the demands that there were in that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.380
 channel I do not know if people have believed that 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.930
 by making a separate channel he warcraft 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.780
 was going to be an elitist channel of these 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.239
 they do nothing but teach pvp and what 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 better and with all guides how to handle 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.019
 to classes and how to be super pro in the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 warcraft because it's going to be that not because I 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.300
 I am nothing but I am mankiw chasm and what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 that I always like to teach is the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 fun of warcraft iii and using the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 game how should it be not a thing 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 which is to play with friends and pass it on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.840
 well and not be antisocial in a game 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 online do not talk to anyone and do not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.470
 nothing more than all the time pvp and be tempted 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 the super pro and things of those that are being 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 now converting the world of warcraft 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 and I'm not liking anything so it's 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 why in the end 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 and stop uploading videos there because 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.780
 final 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 I did not like it or I did not feel comfortable 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.229
 uploading videos there I missed the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 like saying what I liked to me and not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.100
 it felt great when coming up 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.700
 example in the cons series and that of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 Upload levels on a private server 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.049
 loved the acceptance that there was not 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520
 there were problems be laughs or that was what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.399
 that I liked what I did 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.799
 I liked to broadcast in those videos 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 I tried to do the same in the other here in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.319
 the word warcraft channel that believes but 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.280
 people did not like it and it was the same or 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:59.520
 I do not know what happened and then the guides that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 I started doing also not saying that to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.869
 see when I was going to do other guides that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.869
 I am very seen and others when 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.929
 I had a good acceptance here 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.880
 people thanked them and others that in the end 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.870
 I did not like the treatment that has been 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.870
 in that channel there 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.239
 to do it or to go to super 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.860
 excited to want to make videos and others 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.160
 it has become an obligation that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.100
 me 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.590
 and I've done it or I do not understand 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.290
 better than both demands and so much 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.560
 it has become an obligation to me 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.380
 making videos of the world of warcraft and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.170
 not because I want to and in the end it's like 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.970
 if something you like oblige you to do 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.480
 force them to do it and at the end finish 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.220
 saying no I do not want because I do not know 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 it becomes something that I like but 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.120
 in something that you are forcing me to do 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.549
 you are the difference and in the end 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.000
 I burned like the explanation the 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:02.540
 had arranged in the channel video of 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.610
 warcraft so I said that I 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.459
 I'm rolling good here I'm going to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.010
 teach the character that I have to 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.879
 ylenia a level 11 paladin but not 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.110
 you already had others of level 90 yes I know 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.209
 I have had a cocoa characters and longer 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.640
 I was finally establishing in a no 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.530
 that was the paladin stretches and why 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.680
 then I have another one for the level dina 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 11 It is very easy when we are 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.380
 freeing attracts dying and assume 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.690
 there will be the 100 currency 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.160
 we are in one of the dungeons 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.190
 some that were zoomed and good were 22 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.930
 guys and we liked you we were 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.700
 talking where the whole dungeon and so on 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.590
 well I do not because they are staying 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.900
 is concentrated and so on but it's going to be 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.150
 he was quite talking to them and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.980
 since then now they are calling us 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.010
 every two times three to do 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.560
 anything if it appears to have a 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.690
 brotherhood what they are doing of everything 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.420
 and they invite us to everything if they have to 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.580
 go to old age they call us so that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.350
 we want and that we are different 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.570
 server so if they make a 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.550
 one of these ancient dungeons for 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.070
 get achievements call us right away 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.740
 to warn that they are going and they keep us 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.240
 hollow and others is a pass what 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.000
 I'm really looking for myself in a 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.090
 brotherhood and that's how it does not go for the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.330
 fun of warcraft because it's what 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.000
 I am looking for fun and friendship to play 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.300
 with friends and not being autistic and being all 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.390
 the time alone so that's why I myself 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.120
 create or at the end 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.850
 one for the dyna in zeitÃºn since it goes to 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.090
 be this same I have decided that in the end 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.949
 the paladin invades me 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.260
 what others then have the same 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.199
 characters afterwards it is clear but 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.410
 is surely going to be my main and 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.530
 dashiell will not alleviate another character 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.050
 is going to migrate here makes tuna so 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.000
 right now you could say that in the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.220
 kingdom that we are going to play is going to be tuna 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.919
 and good for now, I'll be with 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.600
 this character only you already know which 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.600
 killen already in cdc tuna 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.620
 and nothing else simply to warn 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.040
 that I'm going to summarize the videos that 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.680
 I have to upload on the world of the channel 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.940
 warcraft here since that channel I'm going to 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.400
 close 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.560
 and until then you can upload those 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.310
 videos and when you've uploaded those 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.120
 videos 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.020
 then it will start to climb more in the warcraft 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.250
 I'll try to make it twice a week 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.990
 or for now it will only be one but I have 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.300
 thought of trying to do two when 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.270
 finish cell and pokemon 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.640
 and now one of the reasons why 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.729
 I made the warcraft channel was 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.009
 basically 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.279
 because you could make lists of 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.259
 more orderly reproduction but now 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.999
 dashiell told me in a super way 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.779
 cool to leave the channel with the lists 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:08.490
 of reproduction well placed and that 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.740
 can make playlists 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.099
 within other playlists 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.900
 It's a very strange thing but very cool 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.849
 that I will leave well ordered and all the 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.069
 section of the warcraft so that if you want 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.219
 see the playlist of frames 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.800
 you can see it you can see it and all those 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.990
 things and good simply because that you 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.999
 I apologize for having made this dizziness 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.159
 but I did not like that that deal in 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:37.349
 the other channel I do not know I do not know what 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.659
 happened because here always worked 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:44.399
 well there was good 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:46.050
 filippo feedback or as it is said no and in 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.330
 the other channel is going to be that not like that 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.440
 what 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.530
 in the end 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.830
 although it bothers me not because I wanted 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.600
 have those things separate but for 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.040
 have them separated and you do not have to be 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.350
 comfortable with it because it will be no and 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.970
 well as to finish we left a 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:12.930
 small question you want to see how killen 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:15.630
 and will gradually progress in the 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.200
 warcraft or you already want directly that 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:23.880
 Bring guides and other mounts and 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.740
 and those things, yes, if you want the 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.060
 adventures of killen ya so to say no 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.970
 it would be called the same I will upload it from 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.070
 new year because I still have videos 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.590
 to summarize from the world of warcraft well 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.080
 that that was simply for 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.090
 ask us that and that you know that the 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.770
 world of warcraft is going to stay in this 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.100
 channel so I hope you liked it 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:50.360
 this news and see you in the next 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.360
 agur video
