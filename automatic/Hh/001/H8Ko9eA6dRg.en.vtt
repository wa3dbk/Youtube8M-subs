00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
custom PC review here and today I'm

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
custom PC review here and today I'm
going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:16.980> doing<00:00:17.190> another<00:00:17.550> video<00:00:17.850> tutorial

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
going to be doing another video tutorial

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
going to be doing another video tutorial
on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:20.810> overclocking<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:23.119> z68<00:00:24.119> AGD<00:00:24.869> 65

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
on the overclocking of the z68 AGD 65

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.659 
on the overclocking of the z68 AGD 65
with<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.369> i7<00:00:27.050> 2600

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.549 

this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.210> new<00:00:33.719> g3<00:00:34.850> chipset<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> z68

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this is the new g3 chipset for the z68

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.420 
this is the new g3 chipset for the z68
AGD<00:00:38.129> 65<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> click<00:00:42.210> BIOS<00:00:42.600> too<00:00:43.430> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
AGD 65 and it has the click BIOS too so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.740 
AGD 65 and it has the click BIOS too so
right<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.030> running<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
right now I'm just running through a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.529 
right now I'm just running through a
couple<00:00:46.140> things<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.710> click<00:00:47.219> BIOS<00:00:47.579> 2<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.120> give

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
couple things in click BIOS 2 to give

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
couple things in click BIOS 2 to give
you<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> quick<00:00:48.960> tour<00:00:49.200> before<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.489> into<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you a quick tour before I get into the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
you a quick tour before I get into the
overclocking<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.469> already<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
overclocking and I already have it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.189 
overclocking and I already have it
overclocked<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> settings<00:00:54.870> will<00:00:55.170> be

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
overclocked so all the settings will be

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.340 
overclocked so all the settings will be
there<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.489> show<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.350> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
there but I just want to show you and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.490 
there but I just want to show you and
explain<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.370> while<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.020 

there's<00:01:04.500> energy-saving<00:01:05.400> menu<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:08.400> browser

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there's energy-saving menu and browser

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
there's energy-saving menu and browser
whoa<00:01:09.390> okay<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> utilities<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.870> I<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.950> know

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
whoa okay the utilities and I don't know

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.670 
whoa okay the utilities and I don't know
what<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.280> HDD<00:01:14.850> backup<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.810> security<00:01:18.810> all

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
what this HDD backup is and security all

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.730 
what this HDD backup is and security all
right<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.070> let's<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.700> overclocking

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
right so let's start the overclocking

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.240 
right so let's start the overclocking
first<00:01:24.170> take<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.290> look<00:01:25.410> at<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.860> settings

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
first take a look at all these settings

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.380 
first take a look at all these settings
right<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.690> first<00:01:27.690> thing<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
right here first thing you want to do is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.900 
right here first thing you want to do is
well<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.630> me<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> typically<00:01:31.530> enable<00:01:32.040> XMP<00:01:33.050> and

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
well for me I typically enable XMP and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.400 
well for me I typically enable XMP and
the<00:01:35.910> disable<00:01:36.509> spread<00:01:36.900> spectrum<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:39.410> typically

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
the disable spread spectrum I typically

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.790 
the disable spread spectrum I typically
do<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> CPU<00:01:41.940> PLL<00:01:42.150> voltage<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.350> point<00:01:43.560> six

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
do the CPU PLL voltage at one point six

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.890 
do the CPU PLL voltage at one point six
five<00:01:43.979> volts<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.610> you're<00:01:45.270> welcome<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> leave

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
five volts but you're welcome to leave

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.880 
five volts but you're welcome to leave
it<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.110> auto<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.090> other<00:01:48.300> settings

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890

okay so now that the computers booted up
the<00:03:18.780> first<00:03:19.110> thing<00:03:19.350> I'm<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.830> do<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.280> fire

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
the first thing I'm going to do is fire

the first thing I'm going to do is fire
up<00:03:20.670> cpu-z

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
up cpu-z

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.680 
up cpu-z
and<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.800> be<00:03:22.980> running<00:03:23.190> at<00:03:23.400> about<00:03:23.690> 1.6

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and it should be running at about 1.6

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.690 
and it should be running at about 1.6
gigahertz

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
gigahertz

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.400 
gigahertz
because<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.030> way<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.210> overclocked<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
because the way I overclocked it is to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.220 
because the way I overclocked it is to
use<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> turbo<00:03:28.920> boost<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.810> know<00:03:30.810> it's<00:03:31.020> running

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
use a turbo boost and know it's running

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
use a turbo boost and know it's running
at<00:03:32.180> 4.5<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:34.910> okay<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.000> looks<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.510> bowl

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
at 4.5 so okay it looks like a bowl

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.990 
at 4.5 so okay it looks like a bowl

apologize<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.360> white<00:04:12.630> background<00:04:12.959> is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
apologize it the white background is

apologize it the white background is
very<00:04:13.890> hard<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.280> see<00:04:14.459> on<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> video<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.950> from

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
very hard to see on the video but from

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.900 
very hard to see on the video but from
my<00:04:17.130> angle<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.060> running<00:04:18.390> at<00:04:18.690> slightly<00:04:19.620> below

my angle it is running at slightly below

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.930 
my angle it is running at slightly below
4.5<00:04:20.910> gigahertz<00:04:21.239> because<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.989> base<00:04:22.200> clock

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
4.5 gigahertz because the base clock

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.040 
4.5 gigahertz because the base clock
isn't<00:04:23.940> exactly<00:04:24.540> 100<00:04:25.290> megahertz
