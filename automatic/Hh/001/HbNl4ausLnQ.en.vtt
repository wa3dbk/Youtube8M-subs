 today it is the most perfect in the world 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 rocket motors and invented them and collected 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.080
 in Moscow region Khimki in the shops of the settlement

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.570
 showed himself already taking off he is successful 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.050
 and in December 2014 successfully 5 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.410
 engines worked in the composition 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.710
 strong vibration is also felt

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.470
 engine rd 191 who got a ticket 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.540
 on the spaceport began to create and new 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.790
 modification of engines including 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.729
 we have developed overseas customers 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.899
 engine modification rd 191 engine 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.820
 rd 193 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.070
 for the Russian light rocket union 21 in 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 modification of the engine rd 191 which 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.649
 called rd 181 for launch vehicles 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.289
 Antares American company orbital 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.240
 science corporation contract with 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.869
 American partners were imprisoned in 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 the midst of the mid-December sanctions 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.869
 2014 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.909
 it turned out the US space program when flying 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.500
 Russia cannot do without Russia 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.840
 the Americans went to the conditions of Roscosmos 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.210
 do not use Russian motors for 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.640
 defense targets only 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.280
 the difference of this project is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 the same project rd 180 Americans do not 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.510
 paid money to develop this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.550
 engine 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.180
 so in a government decree 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.040
 We are clearly stated that we pass 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.710
 design documentation only in 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 limited scope so that you can 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.020
 it was work engines install 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.100
 his rocket to prepare in the ice 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.860
 technological documentation is not at all 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.390
 pass to create on the basis of 191 other 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.680
 181 modifications with technical 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.700
 modifications took three years 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.410
 liquid rocket engine 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:11.260
 rd 181 pressure in the combustion chamber 262 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.200
 atmosphere temperature is 3500 degrees on 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 american rocket antor sr 181 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.550
 will replace the engine and j 26 its time 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.430
 and white programs some experts 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.470
 believe it and j 26 tale reasons 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.130
 explosion of antharas with a ship signal on 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.590
 start up 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.180
 last october 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.939
 yeah 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
 failure was another reason to turn 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.549
 attention to the products Khimki 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.549
 engines becoming 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.310
 be here during the test 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.970
 engines are prohibited 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.160
 sean reaches almost 170 decibels per person 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.580
 it threatens to rupture eardrums 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.290
 water pressure supplied to the units 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.480
 simulates rocket fuel pressure 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.400
 water is like a model liquid 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.440
 which is being replaced by the rocket component 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.950
 fuel 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.250
 means the characteristics obtained on the water 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.650
 recalculated for real components 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.200
 there is a linking of parameters and 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.600
 and then comes the engine assembly in 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.370
 whole create something like 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.989
 foreign partners did not even think 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.540
 expensive and long 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.729
 under the terms of the contract, the first four 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.030
 engine must go to america in 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.470
 during this year however commercial 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.780
 order does not cancel the main 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.120
 work on promising Russian 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.009
 We share projects with Harrow Center . 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.999
 Nothing Keldysh center conduct study 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.169
 engine rd 195 is the engine 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:44.589
 promising engine for reusable 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.849
 space systems are full-fledged 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:48.339
 propulsion engines 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.680
 the main task of which is to tear off the rocket 1 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:53.770
 and and will go to the desired height 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.509
 there is no alternative to them yet without 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.240
 rocket engines must be reduced 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.639
 save fuel which is important when flying 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.490
 to other planets we started to study 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.419
 a new type of engine for us 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.870
 remote victims in the engine chamber 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.300
 detonation energy is used 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.580
 shock and shock wave chemical 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.180
 reactions occur in thousandths 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.370
 seconds pressure and temperature at the front 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.529
 shock wave is much higher in 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.789
 compared to modern railway 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:29.610
 and collectively it provides 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.319
 significant increase in energy release 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.509
 simply put it is an engine which 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.509
 running pulses we already 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.039
 designed the camera studies 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.709
 we release drawings 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:46.149
 production began to produce 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:48.069
 the material part and well, where is this autumn 

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.520
 at the end of autumn we plan to go to 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.520
 fire tests 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.630
 how to effectively use such 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.150
 the engine will be clear on the test when 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.340
 start from the ground or already during the flight in 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.780
 space designers know it 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.880
 technical capabilities 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.490
 however, all points of contention are necessary. 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.289
 test in practice on many issues 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.650
 still under research 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.780
 work so far he has never been anywhere 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.210
 practically realized there is only 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.690
 experimental combustion plants 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.139
 the most energy-intensive camera warhead 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.479
 not done as it is now 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:34.780
 continuous process of burning components 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:37.699
 fuel and it happens as if spontaneously 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.259
 creating detonation types of explosives 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.169
 waves 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:45.949
 which is at this detonation site 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:47.259
 realizes the temperature much higher than in 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.930
 this engine 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:53.479
 substantially higher pressures thing 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.090
 same task to confirm the effectiveness and we 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.159
 engine again maybe he 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.370
 will be a new word in the rocket engine 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:03.500
 structure 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.500
 for flights to the moon and even to mars
