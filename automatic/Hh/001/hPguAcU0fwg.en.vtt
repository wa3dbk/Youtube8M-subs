 important for the fbc that is the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 rediscussion of project contents 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 pedagogy of bct that is very confused

 to the community what the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.270
 principles that guided the current ooo 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.270
 offering a bachelor in science and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 that the highest cost of 3 and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 all students who enter science with 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.929
 house management make it the most 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.479
 Brazil is an important course in the 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:22.619
 inasmuch as it has been observed throughout 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 the Brazilian community because it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.270
 proposes to bring about a reform of the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.729
 university in the area of science and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.069
 to make another cut of the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.890
 knowledge that is a cut of teaching 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.220
 internalize that people understand that it is the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.550
 host needed for the century's students. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.349

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.429
 Let's go back and discuss it at the institution. 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.950
 some subjects that need to be 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.869
 discussed that we should discuss it again 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.989
 the projects we have great challenges 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.910
 with teaching aids such as how 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:00.000
 they build a didactic material 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.890
 As feature is to encourage students to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 to study how to seek in their 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.020
 knowledge 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.929
 finally a whole re-discussion of what has 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.420
 which are the principles of our project 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.020
 pedagogy that we are starting today 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.819
 and that people expect that the people who 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.880
 the whole community will participate with the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.880
 people
