to<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.700> ten<00:03:31.880> days<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.040> ten<00:03:34.220> legs<00:03:34.400> have

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
to the ten days so the ten legs have

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.140 
to the ten days so the ten legs have
more<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:36.170> cat<00:03:36.410> eye<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.280> then<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:41.030> go

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
more of a cat eye but and then they go

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.330 
more of a cat eye but and then they go
out<00:03:41.330> but<00:03:41.600> these<00:03:41.870> they're<00:03:42.560> definitely<00:03:42.739> rounder

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340
