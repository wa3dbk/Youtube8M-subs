00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the ground tories are a lot of fun

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.930 
the ground tories are a lot of fun
there's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.789> them

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
there's a lot that you can do with them

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
there's a lot that you can do with them
then<00:01:00.690> we've<00:01:00.780> got<00:01:00.809> ass<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.109> boxer<00:01:01.500> blow<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
then we've got ass a boxer blow this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.020 
then we've got ass a boxer blow this
thing<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.609> excited

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
thing I'm pretty I'm pretty excited

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
thing I'm pretty I'm pretty excited
about<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.379> probably<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
about this is going to be probably the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
about this is going to be probably the
craziest<00:01:05.489> server<00:01:05.909> we've<00:01:06.090> ever<00:01:06.210> installed<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
craziest server we've ever installed in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
craziest server we've ever installed in
terms<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.170> overkill<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> high

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
terms of overkill this is the high

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.289 
terms of overkill this is the high
voltage<00:01:09.000> servo<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:11.150> 277<00:01:12.150> ounce

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
voltage servo so this thing is 277 ounce

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
for a truggy 300 to be ok but we got it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.080

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
probably run it regulated for good

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
probably run it regulated for good
measure<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.119> nonetheless<00:01:27.720> plenty<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> speed

adequate<00:01:29.880> torque<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> can

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
adequate torque if you can if you can

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
adequate torque if you can if you can
produce<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.979> torque<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> still

produce that kind of torque and still

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.399 
produce that kind of torque and still
hold<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.850> speed<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:33.930> should<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.140> pretty

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hold that speed I think should be pretty

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
hold that speed I think should be pretty
pretty<00:01:34.770> nuts<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.340> hoping<00:01:35.520> that'll<00:01:35.729> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
pretty nuts so we're hoping that'll be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
pretty nuts so we're hoping that'll be
more<00:01:36.270> than<00:01:36.450> enough<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.810> we're<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
more than enough for we're going to be

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
more than enough for we're going to be
using<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.579> course<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
using it for and then of course we got a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.899 
using it for and then of course we got a
spektrum<00:01:39.630> receiver<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.140> our<00:01:40.290> spectrum<00:01:40.590> radio

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
spektrum receiver for our spectrum radio

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
spektrum receiver for our spectrum radio
so<00:01:41.909> set<00:01:42.479> these<00:01:42.630> aside<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.710> show<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> next

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so set these aside and show you the next

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.870 
so set these aside and show you the next
piece<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> nitro<00:01:46.619> powered

paint we're excited about that we're
going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.240> pretty<00:02:36.420> cool<00:02:36.630> paint<00:02:36.900> scheme<00:02:37.110> on

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
going to a pretty cool paint scheme on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
going to a pretty cool paint scheme on
it<00:02:37.350> they<00:02:37.860> already<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.340> these<00:02:38.520> big<00:02:38.730> cooling

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it they already have these big cooling

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460 
it they already have these big cooling
holes<00:02:39.240> cut<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.780> again<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.320> for

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
holes cut out of it again this is for

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.260 
holes cut out of it again this is for
the<00:02:40.500> Nitro<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> Nitro<00:02:41.670> cooling<00:02:41.970> had<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> be

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
the Nitro so the Nitro cooling had to be

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.120 
the Nitro so the Nitro cooling had to be
sitting<00:02:42.450> right<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.800> want<00:02:43.980> all

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
sitting right in here and you want all

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.920 
sitting right in here and you want all
the<00:02:44.280> air<00:02:44.400> flow<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.790> over<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.660> doesn't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the air flow going over it it doesn't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.180 
the air flow going over it it doesn't
hurt<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> have<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.560> electric<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.040> not

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
hurt to have that for electric it's not

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
hurt to have that for electric it's not
really<00:02:47.400> needed<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.660> how<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
really needed but you know it's how it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.330 
really needed but you know it's how it
comes<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.290> we'll<00:02:49.500> run<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.770> will<00:02:49.890> paint<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
comes so we'll run it will paint it and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.680 
comes so we'll run it will paint it and
probably<00:02:50.489> get<00:02:50.700> an<00:02:50.790> aftermarket<00:02:50.940> body<00:02:51.480> from

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
probably get an aftermarket body from

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.729 
probably get an aftermarket body from
proline<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.230> something<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:53.310> run<00:02:53.489> shortly<00:02:54.739> the

carbon<00:03:26.310> fiber<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.480> ridiculous<00:03:28.019> then

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
carbon fiber it's just ridiculous then

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.020 
carbon fiber it's just ridiculous then
we<00:03:28.590> look<00:03:28.739> at<00:03:28.890> things<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.640> steering

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
we look at things like the steering

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.789 
we look at things like the steering
itself<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.690> drag<00:03:30.989> link<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> milled<00:03:31.650> aluminum

we<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.790> sway<00:03:33.120> bars<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.630> front<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:34.860> kind

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
we have sway bars in front this is kind

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.370 
we have sway bars in front this is kind
of<00:03:35.280> sad<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.480> carbon<00:03:36.780> fiber<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.260> in

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
of sad the we have carbon fiber here in

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.229 
of sad the we have carbon fiber here in
the<00:03:37.500> stock<00:03:37.799> radio<00:03:38.160> tray<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.640> we're<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.180> to

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the stock radio tray and we're going to

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.610 
the stock radio tray and we're going to
be<00:03:39.329> getting<00:03:39.480> rid<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> electric

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
be getting rid of that for the electric

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.430 
be getting rid of that for the electric
conversion<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.750> we're<00:03:42.750> sad<00:03:42.989> about<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.260> but

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
conversion so we're sad about that but

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.620 
conversion so we're sad about that but
that's<00:03:43.920> okay<00:03:44.220> same<00:03:44.760> goes<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.299> upper

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
that's okay same goes with the upper

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.199 
that's okay same goes with the upper

electric conversion that's okay maybe

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.500

them maker suppose feel good but it just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.039 
them maker suppose feel good but it just
goes<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> show<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.269> extra<00:03:57.540> length<00:03:57.720> they<00:03:57.900> go

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
goes to show the extra length they go

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
sway bars in the rear obviously you have

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.539 
sway bars in the rear obviously you have
17<00:04:08.850> millimeter<00:04:09.360> wheel<00:04:10.230> adapters<00:04:10.799> we<00:04:11.430> have

17 millimeter wheel adapters we have

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.640 
17 millimeter wheel adapters we have
CBDs<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.540> way<00:04:12.630> around<00:04:12.750> usually<00:04:13.230> only<00:04:13.530> get

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
CBDs all the way around usually only get

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.800 
CBDs all the way around usually only get
dog<00:04:13.859> bones<00:04:14.070> in<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.280> back<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:15.090> only<00:04:15.209> need<00:04:15.359> CBDs

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
dog bones in the back you only need CBDs

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.599 
dog bones in the back you only need CBDs
usually<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.680> front<00:04:16.919> because<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.280> got<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
usually in the front because you got the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.250 
usually in the front because you got the
angle<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.269> steering<00:04:18.600> introduce<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
angle the steering introduce it in the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.840 
angle the steering introduce it in the
suspension<00:04:19.829> they<00:04:20.280> put<00:04:20.459> them<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.729> rear

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
suspension they put them on the rear

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.670 
suspension they put them on the rear
just<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.150> keep<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.479> flowing<00:04:21.989> smooth<00:04:22.289> which<00:04:22.530> is

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
just to keep it flowing smooth which is

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.010 
just to keep it flowing smooth which is
awesome<00:04:23.099> like<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.880> said<00:04:23.940> aluminum<00:04:24.690> threaded

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
awesome like I said aluminum threaded

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.790 
awesome like I said aluminum threaded
shocks<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> front<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.979> rear

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
shocks on the front and rear

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.809 
shocks on the front and rear
even<00:04:27.129> the<00:04:27.280> kingpin<00:04:28.270> balls<00:04:28.720> are<00:04:29.490> not<00:04:30.490> what<00:04:30.789> you

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
even the kingpin balls are not what you

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.399 
even the kingpin balls are not what you
usually<00:04:30.970> see<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.690> it's<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.020> two<00:04:32.199> piece

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
usually see it's a it's a two piece

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.170 
usually see it's a it's a two piece
design<00:04:32.440> I'm<00:04:33.190> sure<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.520> guys<00:04:33.639> could<00:04:33.849> fill<00:04:34.060> me

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
design I'm sure you guys could fill me

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.550 
design I'm sure you guys could fill me
in<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.539> little<00:04:34.629> bit<00:04:34.870> more<00:04:35.020> we<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
in on this a little bit more we have the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.960 
in on this a little bit more we have the
same<00:04:35.800> ones<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.099> are<00:04:36.190> bugging<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.639> noticed

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
same ones that are bugging I noticed

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.240 
same ones that are bugging I noticed
that<00:04:37.030> it's<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:37.599> by<00:04:37.840> metal<00:04:38.229> they<00:04:38.349> have<00:04:38.500> steel

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
that it's it's by metal they have steel

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.100 
that it's it's by metal they have steel
and<00:04:39.550> then<00:04:39.759> aluminum<00:04:40.270> balls<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.780> aluminum

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and then aluminum balls and aluminum

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.839 
and then aluminum balls and aluminum
balls<00:04:41.289> looks<00:04:41.530> like<00:04:41.650> they're<00:04:41.800> anodized<00:04:42.220> that

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
balls looks like they're anodized that

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.610 
balls looks like they're anodized that
just<00:04:43.030> gives<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.270> really<00:04:43.539> smooth<00:04:43.960> response<00:04:44.409> on

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
just gives you really smooth response on

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.990 
just gives you really smooth response on
those<00:04:44.740> pivot<00:04:45.009> ball<00:04:45.159> so<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.370> doesn't<00:04:45.610> bind<00:04:45.759> up

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
those pivot ball so it doesn't bind up

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.210 
those pivot ball so it doesn't bind up
again<00:04:46.750> like<00:04:46.930> all<00:04:47.379> these<00:04:47.530> little<00:04:47.740> things<00:04:47.860> add

are<00:05:06.400> for<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:06.729> Nitro<00:05:06.909> so<00:05:07.330> we'll<00:05:07.509> be<00:05:07.629> getting

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
are for the Nitro so we'll be getting

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.820 
are for the Nitro so we'll be getting
rid<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.319> going<00:05:08.440> with<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.650> plastic

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
rid of that and going with the plastic

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.990 
rid of that and going with the plastic
one<00:05:09.250> why<00:05:09.879> well<00:05:10.300> steal<00:05:10.690> steals<00:05:11.530> nicer<00:05:11.979> in<00:05:12.280> nitro

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
one why well steal steals nicer in nitro

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.939 
one why well steal steals nicer in nitro
because<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.389> will<00:05:13.479> resist<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.870> heat<00:05:14.110> up<00:05:14.680> quite

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
because it will resist the heat up quite

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.649 
because it will resist the heat up quite
a<00:05:14.979> bit<00:05:15.129> better<00:05:15.250> our<00:05:15.520> electric<00:05:15.909> system<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.509> not

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
a bit better our electric system is not

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:17.850 
a bit better our electric system is not
going<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.840> produce<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.259> kind<00:05:17.319> of<00:05:17.530> heat<00:05:17.650> so

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
going to produce that kind of heat so

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.399 
going to produce that kind of heat so
plastic<00:05:18.250> will<00:05:18.400> do<00:05:18.490> just<00:05:18.759> fine<00:05:18.819> it's<00:05:19.569> plenty<00:05:20.319> of

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
plastic will do just fine it's plenty of

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.279 
plastic will do just fine it's plenty of
pitch<00:05:20.789> plenty<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:21.849> tooth<00:05:22.060> with<00:05:22.569> to<00:05:22.930> help<00:05:23.110> hold

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
pitch plenty of tooth with to help hold

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.240 
pitch plenty of tooth with to help hold
the<00:05:23.379> torque<00:05:23.680> so<00:05:23.860> we're<00:05:23.949> not<00:05:24.039> worried<00:05:24.219> about

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
the torque so we're not worried about

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.879 
the torque so we're not worried about
that<00:05:24.400> again<00:05:25.240> spill<00:05:26.199> guard<00:05:26.440> here<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.740> gas

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
that again spill guard here in the gas

I<00:05:30.460> think<00:05:30.580> we'll<00:05:30.819> be<00:05:30.849> reusing<00:05:31.389> so<00:05:31.569> it'll<00:05:31.690> be

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
I think we'll be reusing so it'll be

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.320 
I think we'll be reusing so it'll be

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 
but unfortunately for us there's really

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.309

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
we will be taking it to a track

eventually<00:06:28.240> we<00:06:28.659> have<00:06:28.779> a<00:06:28.810> few<00:06:29.050> in<00:06:29.139> mind<00:06:29.289> this

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
eventually we have a few in mind this

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.439
