00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.130
 recommend the costs almost 100 euro in the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.180
 internet even partly already for 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.830
 85 euros 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.990
 but actually quite simple is one 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.160
 you have to have linux system on it 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.699
 do not be afraid now 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.529
 you just play it's extreme 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.210
 Who is the one to blame? 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.510
 you are under normal for free 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.780
 without logging them on the copied 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.989
 USB stick and put the usb stick in 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.660
 this box should then start the box 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.940
 new while the usb stick usb stick 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.200
 infected is the image becomes 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.399
 automatically installed 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.860
 then let the station search 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.539
 run the normal way 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.149
 satellite transmitter if you do not have one 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.480
 TV was in the search for the 11th 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.660
 from 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.020
 so is the LAN cable 1 or in the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.930
 wlan stick and then you are there has mine 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.220
 new operating system on it and that is 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.410
 really simple you just click 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.950
 on menu on the remote one here 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.350
 able to see 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.970
 click on menu goes to extension and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.200
 there are numerous packages to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.610
 because there are down there 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.340
 then when you press the button 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.540
 download extension clicks on it 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
 then at some point there is here 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.610
 This year, for example, for Turkish television 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.810
 or for many other countries tour 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.850
 vdv if you look at the program or 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.610
 package says it in the minus range 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.950
 it has downloaded in the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.509
 main menu displayed as I said everything in the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.229
 TV click menu and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.729
 at the top of this new program 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.119
 is that ok with me and runs it all 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.340
 normal program continues and then there is 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.189
 I choose a lot of her 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.509
 no turkish but say it anyway 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.369
 I sometimes more or less understandable 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.899
 if you click on the number two one clicks 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:12.280
 ok and then just go to the here 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.420
 List 1 or 2 is really no matter what 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.980
 you book the whole for example 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 Turkish channels just swedish times 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.320
 atelier 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.000
 let's say okay takes a little 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.140
 second 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.430
 otherwise the program was created 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.790
 from the quality of the quality 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.080
 really good if you're on 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:44.200
 exit on the formulation clicks 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.200
 Combined sender list eg on ctv 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.459
 that was now channel 2 aggravated 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.660
 I do not think so and so 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.990
 You can also see the surroundings are spreading 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.990
 perfect 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.350
 So really easy to use on 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.200
 then you 're done and you're human 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:16.000
 switch back to the satellite tv 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.000
 click on the red button exit 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.430
 Do you want to quit? 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.790
 again in normal fans are view of 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.670
 a top quality city and really it 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.830
 once fall to use as can this 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.690
 open atv only recommend hazard 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.730
 I have to do a little bit first 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.730
 but settle in itself it is very 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.930
 simple set up 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.940
 when should be asking me could 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.600
 host says it had any layman 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.580
 serve 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.230
 Every layman can have such an image 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.820
 freiburger has something back somewhere 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.530

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.680
 now tested regularly for two weeks 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.190
 and all stations are always there 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.080
 if us-sender turkish stations 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.040
