00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.520

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.720

 close just that I managed to record 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.390
 static 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.730

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.730
 static 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.450
 look 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.500
 sometimes and I say 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.040
 or I will follow it 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.650
 run dude 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.860
 you do not know what I want I want the charger 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.860
 of what I wanted 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.170
 the guy and the corde did not do too much 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.170
 come come come 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.269
 and until now 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.489
 for example 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.840
 in a bird 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.170
 you saw it 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:40.080
 go so far beyond a backpack of the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.210
 of the wood thing from nothing and she 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.860
 he said I see it and I saw it at the beginning they are 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.940
 and where 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.350
 imagine and here I am seeing it where 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.350
 It's bigger than a car I think 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.110
 h 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.920
 that is increasing until today now 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.049
 they move a little above the top of the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.879
 building a mere corner on this side 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.879
 above will limit life to life 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.620
 I say because in this area it's where 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.229
 the light comes out is that I've recorded look 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.359

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.840
 do not manches you say all your studies 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.840
 balloon 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.620
 and even mark the total stack of stamina 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.490
 my intuition 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.490
 for you 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.379
 Y 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.039
 uncover the script is working the 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.580
 working is going to rosarito 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.930
 Useful 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.080
 and all that 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.080
 and he's already going to the challenges 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.349
 watson 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.230

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130
 Y 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.320
 although his anger thanks is there 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.360
 that saying you're going to the 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.580
 asia towards him that's as if they were 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.580
 many as if it were the sea 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.710
 Marrugo to the sea
