00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
and give you full stops a tenth the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.860 
and give you full stops a tenth the
stops<00:01:43.780> by<00:01:43.990> just<00:01:44.229> pushing<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.619> button

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.010 

so<00:01:48.870> let's<00:01:48.990> moving<00:01:49.260> in<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.530> menu<00:01:49.800> menu<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:51.900> will

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so let's moving in the menu menu it will

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
so let's moving in the menu menu it will
show<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.950> watt<00:01:53.220> seconds<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.790> joules<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
show you in watt seconds or joules the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
show you in watt seconds or joules the
three<00:01:55.160> lights<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.840> connected<00:01:58.310> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
three lights that you have connected so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.080 
three lights that you have connected so
we<00:01:59.820> turn<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.390> it'll<00:02:01.050> go<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:02.090> reflect

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
we turn that up it'll go up to reflect

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.740 
we turn that up it'll go up to reflect
the<00:02:03.210> change<00:02:03.830> so<00:02:04.830> let's<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.250> down<00:02:05.400> here

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the change so let's go down here

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
the change so let's go down here
modeling<00:02:06.750> light<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:08.100> can<00:02:08.280> set<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.760> full<00:02:09.270> or

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
modeling light you can set it to full or

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.610 
modeling light you can set it to full or
crop<00:02:09.930> or<00:02:10.320> half<00:02:11.310> our<00:02:11.810> sequence<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.380> need

multiple pops Tijuana optimal that is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.260 
multiple pops Tijuana optimal that is
probably<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.160> most<00:02:20.400> important<00:02:21.060> ones

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
probably one of the most important ones

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.110 
probably one of the most important ones
that<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.840> use<00:02:22.730> right<00:02:23.730> now<00:02:23.880> it's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that you're going to use right now it's

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.440 
that you're going to use right now it's
set<00:02:24.770> for<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.920> power<00:02:26.130> settings<00:02:26.640> selected<00:02:27.209> it's

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
set for the power settings selected it's

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.180

for<00:02:29.180> optimal<00:02:30.180> color<00:02:30.360> temperature<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.920> can

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
for optimal color temperature you can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.990 
for optimal color temperature you can
switch<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:35.060> specific<00:02:36.060> flash<00:02:37.020> durations<00:02:37.620> or

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
switch it to specific flash durations or

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.870 
switch it to specific flash durations or
you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.150> set<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.200> to1<00:02:40.500> min<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you can set it to this is to1 min this

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.320 
you can set it to this is to1 min this
is<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.540> minimum<00:02:42.990> flash<00:02:43.260> duration<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:44.880> these

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
is the minimum flash duration for these

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.199 
is the minimum flash duration for these
settings<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.500> go<00:02:46.650> down<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.280> couple<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.000> stops

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
settings if we go down a couple of stops

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.290 
settings if we go down a couple of stops
you'll<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.630> it'll<00:02:48.810> change<00:02:49.110> one<00:02:50.070> 4600<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
you'll see it'll change one 4600 for the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.330 
you'll see it'll change one 4600 for the
second<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> as<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:55.320> change<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.070> if<00:02:56.250> you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
second so as you change you can if you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.840 
second so as you change you can if you
just<00:02:56.519> hit<00:02:57.019> to1<00:02:58.019> minimums<00:02:58.440> minimum<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.670> like

shooting a lot of really really fast
quickly<00:04:16.110> I<00:04:16.350> guess<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.860> hook<00:04:19.860> up<00:04:19.950> multiple

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
quickly I guess you can hook up multiple

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.120 
quickly I guess you can hook up multiple
packs<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.600> will<00:04:21.950> alternate<00:04:22.950> between

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
packs so that it will alternate between

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.680 
packs so that it will alternate between
each<00:04:23.520> pack<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.240> don't<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.540> worry

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
each pack and so you don't have to worry

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.150 
each pack and so you don't have to worry
about<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:28.590> recycling

charge time fast versus slow is

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.100 
charge time fast versus slow is
basically<00:04:36.610> just<00:04:36.730> -<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.660> can<00:04:37.810> make<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.050> a

basically just - you can make it a

basically just - you can make it a

recycle slower if you're worried about

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
here's another hint if you want to go up

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.610 
here's another hint if you want to go up
rapidly<00:05:58.259> page<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.310> holding<00:05:59.699> the<00:06:03.379> so<00:06:04.379> here's

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
rapidly page up is holding the so here's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:16.610 
rapidly page up is holding the so here's
our<00:06:04.770> own

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.380 

you<00:06:17.620> can<00:06:17.770> dial<00:06:17.890> these<00:06:18.040> packs<00:06:18.340> way<00:06:18.610> way<00:06:18.850> down<00:06:19.120> if

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
you can dial these packs way way down if

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.420 
you can dial these packs way way down if
you<00:06:19.480> need<00:06:19.630> a<00:06:19.660> little<00:06:19.990> power<00:06:20.320> just<00:06:21.010> pretty<00:06:21.250> nice

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
you need a little power just pretty nice

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.590 
you need a little power just pretty nice
let's<00:06:21.730> see<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:22.000> although<00:06:22.180> we<00:06:22.420> can<00:06:22.570> get<00:06:22.690> this<00:06:24.330> so

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.210 

one<00:06:28.600> eight<00:06:28.750> thousand<00:06:29.140> so<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.380> second<00:06:29.740> is<00:06:29.830> is

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
one eight thousand so the second is is

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.310 
one eight thousand so the second is is
definitely<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.000> fastest<00:06:31.600> that<00:06:31.870> you'll<00:06:32.050> see

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
definitely the fastest that you'll see

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.130 
definitely the fastest that you'll see
on<00:06:32.500> this<00:06:32.650> pack<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:33.940> doesn't<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.570> any<00:06:34.780> higher<00:06:34.810> I

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
on this pack it doesn't go any higher I

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.020 
on this pack it doesn't go any higher I
don't<00:06:35.410> believe<00:06:38.010> we<00:06:39.010> can<00:06:39.160> also<00:06:39.310> see<00:06:39.670> what<00:06:39.700> that

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
don't believe we can also see what that

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.970 
don't believe we can also see what that
is<00:06:40.240> in<00:06:40.420> one<00:06:40.600> second<00:06:40.960> sir<00:06:41.110> Jules<00:06:41.350> the<00:06:41.650> lowest

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
is in one second sir Jules the lowest

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.190 
is in one second sir Jules the lowest
padding<00:06:42.310> is<00:06:42.450> setting<00:06:43.450> for<00:06:43.630> this<00:06:43.720> is<00:06:43.900> three

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
padding is setting for this is three

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.670 
padding is setting for this is three
point<00:06:44.500> three<00:06:44.560> joules<00:06:45.070> per<00:06:45.460> head<00:06:46.410> so<00:06:47.410> that's

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
point three joules per head so that's

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.740 
point three joules per head so that's
really<00:06:48.040> low<00:06:48.370> if<00:06:48.610> you<00:06:48.760> don't<00:06:48.880> select<00:06:49.240> a<00:06:49.510> depth

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
really low if you don't select a depth

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.840 
really low if you don't select a depth
of<00:06:49.900> field<00:06:50.230> so<00:06:50.440> I<00:06:50.590> just<00:06:50.770> like<00:06:50.980> to<00:06:51.130> focus<00:06:51.370> shout

show<00:07:02.700> us<00:07:02.880> that<00:07:03.320> as<00:07:04.320> we<00:07:04.380> turn<00:07:04.950> it<00:07:05.070> up<00:07:05.220> it's<00:07:05.700> still

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
show us that as we turn it up it's still

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.050

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
able to do that for point seven which is

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.080 
able to do that for point seven which is
about<00:07:09.380> about<00:07:10.380> where<00:07:10.830> it<00:07:11.010> will<00:07:11.130> start<00:07:11.460> dropping

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
about about where it will start dropping

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.870

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
down we have another stop five point

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.900 
down we have another stop five point
seven<00:07:15.770> see<00:07:16.770> there<00:07:16.980> it<00:07:17.070> starts<00:07:17.370> to<00:07:17.460> drop<00:07:17.639> down

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
seven see there it starts to drop down

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.879 
seven see there it starts to drop down
but<00:07:20.210> six<00:07:21.210> point<00:07:21.510> seven<00:07:21.780> and<00:07:22.290> what<00:07:22.440> is<00:07:22.560> that<00:07:22.770> in

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
but six point seven and what is that in

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:28.040 
but six point seven and what is that in
the<00:07:22.950> last<00:07:23.100> seconds<00:07:23.900> 107<00:07:24.900> watt<00:07:25.139> seconds<00:07:27.050> and

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.690 
still able to do basically a flash
duration<00:07:31.320> that<00:07:31.590> will<00:07:31.710> freeze<00:07:31.979> action<00:07:32.810> so<00:07:34.700> it's

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
duration that will freeze action so it's

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.780 
duration that will freeze action so it's
a<00:07:35.729> pretty<00:07:35.910> cool<00:07:36.120> pack<00:07:37.700> definitely<00:07:38.700> worth
