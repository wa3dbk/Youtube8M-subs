 [Music] 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:22.060
 the routines names 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.760
 francis completed tour fair with the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.130
 creation has finished beaches each one 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.920
 sport like a little new that is 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.190
 taking discussions in this era 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.190
 it is very important it is very nice sport 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.360
 for the guys for the very people 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.059
 spectacular 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.610
 there are many stunts is a game that does not 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.830
 there is so much friction with the dwarves and 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.540
 injuries then the only thing to have 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.150
 Be very careful with the subject of surface 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.100
 which is very regular, anyone can 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.960
 adapt is a matter of putting yourself in sand 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.890
 in playing a little is fundamental the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.699
 physical preparation since in the sand it is 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.320
 very difficult the issue of speed the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.040
 resistance then you have to be very 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.010
 all right 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.840
 to any advice porte 4 and 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 barkero where one can go changing 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.650
 your tactic for playing 1 2 1 2 2 or 3 1 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.950
 them according to the team they are not going to 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.860
 to sit continuously the rotation is like 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.049
 soccer has been moving in the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.580
 court why it is very important 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.100
 physical preparation the subject of the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.690
 changes a player to its impossible to go to 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.880
 the court of the board has been put that 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.740
 when I entered 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.740
 5 18 minutes 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.270
 in English 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.570
 and the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 my name 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.090
 I recommend you to put the flour 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.700
 this physical state because the first thing you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.050
 is going to tire the solidity of the air without 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 legs 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.330
 to be very tired to capirote you want 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.280
 dispute with a bleak halo for 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.180
 hit the ball then 16 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 when physical states 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.510
 you have to take it as much as possible in the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.730
 air 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 it takes a lot of technique to play 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.909
 this sport although there are almost those that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.590
 also doing with the floor the best thing is 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.450
 try to lift the body ball 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.530
 of the air where many can be generated 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.030
 plays 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.130
 today and also 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.520
 nice move to make like the chile 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.740
 and it remains 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
 and a lot of more spectacular goals 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.680
 that sometimes tend 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 in the field d 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.060
 the sport itself is also in three 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.609
 times of 12 minutes and generates that never 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.879
 you can neglect the game let's say 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.100
 although it can still be 30 the worst 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.470
 period 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.110
 are two more periods is a lot of time 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.260
 even if it looks like a little 12 minutes of 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.570
 sport you can lose a game 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.120
 missing 10 seconds and you can also 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.920
 win losing by two goals can you 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.739
 swimming missing 10 seconds close is very 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.800
 fun I recommend games 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.400
 how 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.400
 Ghana 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.030
 from this
