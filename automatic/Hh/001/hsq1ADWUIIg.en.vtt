copy you're not seeing it happen in this
video<00:00:32.279> because<00:00:32.460> I've<00:00:32.759> already<00:00:33.239> gone<00:00:33.420> through

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
video because I've already gone through

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.959 
video because I've already gone through
the<00:00:33.719> process<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> necessary<00:00:35.550> step

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the process but this is a necessary step

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.020 
the process but this is a necessary step
in<00:00:36.420> multi<00:00:36.930> boxing<00:00:37.350> Diablo<00:00:37.770> 3<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
in multi boxing Diablo 3 and the time it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.670 
in multi boxing Diablo 3 and the time it
takes<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.450> process<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> complete<00:00:40.290> is

takes this process to complete is
entirely<00:00:41.430> dependent<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
entirely dependent on your system and

entirely dependent on your system and
its<00:00:43.500> hardware<00:00:43.950> while<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> cache<00:00:45.239> folders<00:00:45.629> are

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
being copied it may seem like the launch

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000 
being copied it may seem like the launch
process<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.420> stopped<00:00:48.750> responding<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.829> it's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
process has stopped responding but it's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
process has stopped responding but it's
most<00:00:50.370> likely<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.879> doing<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.270> it's

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
most likely just doing what it's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.500 
most likely just doing what it's
supposed<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:52.020> doing<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.890> background

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
supposed to be doing in the background

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.630 
supposed to be doing in the background
again<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.960> process<00:00:55.289> only<00:00:55.680> happens<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> very

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
again this process only happens the very

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
again this process only happens the very
first<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> launch<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:57.960> Diablo<00:00:58.440> 3

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
