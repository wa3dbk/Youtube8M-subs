00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
go you got the phone on the top you just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.860 
go you got the phone on the top you just
pull<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.610> off<00:02:13.850> here<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.240> get<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.630> off

oh<00:02:18.140> come<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.680> there<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.250> are

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
oh come on and there you are

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.510 
oh come on and there you are
so<00:02:26.570> yes<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.680> pretty<00:02:27.890> thick<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.400> I'm

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
so yes it is pretty thick but I'm

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.640 
so yes it is pretty thick but I'm
surprised<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.330> seems<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.750> be<00:02:29.870> actually<00:02:30.080> made

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
surprised this seems to be actually made

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.880 
surprised this seems to be actually made
of<00:02:30.860> metal<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.989> know<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.260> sounds<00:02:33.560> weird<00:02:33.590> but

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
of metal I know that sounds weird but

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.920 
of metal I know that sounds weird but
I'm<00:02:34.040> probably<00:02:34.340> wrong<00:02:34.730> just<00:02:35.360> because<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.750> was

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
I'm probably wrong just because this was

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
I'm probably wrong just because this was
outside<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> nine<00:02:37.010> degree<00:02:37.430> weather

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
outside in the nine degree weather

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.690 
outside in the nine degree weather
because<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.330> snowing<00:02:38.720> outside<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.670> has<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
because it's snowing outside on has a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.970 
because it's snowing outside on has a
pretty<00:02:41.030> nice<00:02:41.209> suit<00:02:41.570> huge<00:02:42.290> screen<00:02:42.739> actually

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
pretty nice suit huge screen actually

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.160 
pretty nice suit huge screen actually
for<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> phone<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.940> type<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.870> course

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
for a phone of this type and of course

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.830 
for a phone of this type and of course
it's<00:02:45.530> not<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.940> um<00:02:47.800> small<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:50.660> think

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
it's not that um small I don't think

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.380 
it's not that um small I don't think
it's<00:02:50.959> metal<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.489> definitely<00:02:52.640> feels<00:02:52.970> cold

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
it's metal but it definitely feels cold

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.000 
it's metal but it definitely feels cold
but<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.170> may<00:02:54.320> be<00:02:54.350> because<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.739> was<00:02:54.860> just

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
but that may be because it was just

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.210 
but that may be because it was just
outside<00:02:56.320> that's<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.590> piece<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.920> cardboard

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
outside that's just a piece of cardboard

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.860 
outside that's just a piece of cardboard

below that we've got our battery let's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.250 
below that we've got our battery let's
see<00:03:47.030> how<00:03:47.090> many<00:03:47.150> milliamp<00:03:47.690> hours<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.170> is

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
see how many milliamp hours it is

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.680 
see how many milliamp hours it is
because<00:03:48.590> Norma<00:03:48.890> amp<00:03:49.070> hours<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.640> everything<00:03:50.329> um

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
because Norma amp hours is everything um

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.060 
because Norma amp hours is everything um

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
back off now this is the hard part just

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.980 
back off now this is the hard part just
oh<00:05:37.060> here<00:05:37.600> we<00:05:37.690> go

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
oh here we go

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.200

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
high quality though I wonder do we get a

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.420 
high quality though I wonder do we get a
memory<00:05:51.040> card<00:05:51.430> slot<00:05:51.850> um<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:53.200> here<00:05:53.620> I<00:05:53.800> don't<00:05:54.220> know

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
memory card slot um in here I don't know

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.480 
memory card slot um in here I don't know
if<00:05:54.490> we<00:05:54.580> will<00:05:54.760> or<00:05:54.910> not<00:05:55.090> um<00:05:56.100> doesn't<00:05:57.100> look<00:05:57.310> like

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
if we will or not um doesn't look like

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.700 
if we will or not um doesn't look like
it<00:05:57.610> but<00:05:57.790> once<00:05:58.030> again<00:05:58.240> there's<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:59.200> massive

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
it but once again there's the massive

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.870 
it but once again there's the massive
speaker<00:06:00.100> it's<00:06:00.190> hard<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.400> see<00:06:00.520> in<00:06:00.580> this<00:06:00.669> light

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
speaker it's hard to see in this light

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.360 
speaker it's hard to see in this light
that<00:06:00.910> whole<00:06:01.300> thing<00:06:01.690> there<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.290> speaker<00:06:02.740> so

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
that whole thing there is the speaker so

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.860 
that whole thing there is the speaker so
then<00:06:03.640> again<00:06:03.820> listening<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.300> musical<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.780> this

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
then again listening to musical and this

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.409 
then again listening to musical and this
will<00:06:05.020> be<00:06:05.140> pretty<00:06:05.350> good<00:06:05.590> on<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:06.250> do<00:06:06.700> not<00:06:06.789> see<00:06:07.390> a

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
will be pretty good on I do not see a

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.990 
will be pretty good on I do not see a
memory<00:06:08.050> card<00:06:08.349> slot<00:06:08.680> anywhere<00:06:09.160> on<00:06:09.340> this<00:06:09.610> so

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
memory card slot anywhere on this so

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.790 
memory card slot anywhere on this so
that's<00:06:10.120> kind<00:06:10.660> of<00:06:10.810> a<00:06:10.900> down<00:06:11.110> point<00:06:11.500> because

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
that's kind of a down point because

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.860 
that's kind of a down point because
these<00:06:11.950> funds<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.850> want<00:06:13.000> to<00:06:13.060> put<00:06:13.150> any<00:06:13.330> musical

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
these funds you want to put any musical

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.740 
these funds you want to put any musical
and<00:06:13.990> then<00:06:14.080> probably<00:06:14.350> need<00:06:15.480> something<00:06:16.480> like

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
and then probably need something like

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.430 
and then probably need something like
that<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.140> get<00:06:17.230> them<00:06:17.410> on<00:06:17.590> um<00:06:19.170> let's<00:06:20.170> put<00:06:20.290> our

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
that to get them on um let's put our
