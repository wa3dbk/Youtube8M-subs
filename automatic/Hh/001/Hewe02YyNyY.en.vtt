I wanted to make a video to talk about
blade<00:00:06.839> centering<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> folder<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:09.860> you<00:00:10.860> know

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
blade centering on a folder and you know

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.129 
blade centering on a folder and you know
a<00:00:11.010> couple<00:00:11.400> reasons<00:00:11.700> why<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.480> off-center

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
a couple reasons why can be off-center

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
a couple reasons why can be off-center
and<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.920> solutions<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.580> those<00:00:16.250> you<00:00:17.250> know<00:00:17.369> it's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and the solutions to those you know it's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
and the solutions to those you know it's
it's<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.330> aesthetic<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's not just aesthetic it's it's a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.189 
it's not just aesthetic it's it's a
legit<00:00:20.010> complaint<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.720> know<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> blades

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
legit complaint that you know the blades

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.929 
legit complaint that you know the blades
off-center<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.250> cause<00:00:23.460> uneven

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
off-center because it can cause uneven

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.240 
off-center because it can cause uneven
and<00:00:24.420> premature<00:00:24.779> wear<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> bushings<00:00:25.859> or

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.980 

the<00:00:29.250> liners<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.269> no<00:00:30.449> bushings<00:00:30.869> like

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the liners if there are no bushings like

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.209 
the liners if there are no bushings like
if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> cricket<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.769> something<00:00:32.040> like

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
if you have a cricket or something like

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
if you have a cricket or something like
that<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:33.360> um<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.570> it's<00:00:36.570> easy<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.110> solve

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that but um you know it's easy to solve

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.470 
that but um you know it's easy to solve
and<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> worry<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.230> you're<00:00:40.559> uh

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
and you don't have to worry if you're uh

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.430 
and you don't have to worry if you're uh
well<00:00:42.480> I'll<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> later<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:45.320> one<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
well I'll get to that later but one of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.270 
well I'll get to that later but one of
the<00:00:46.559> problems<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:48.559> your<00:00:49.559> bushings<00:00:49.950> are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the problems is that your bushings are

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
the problems is that your bushings are
already<00:00:50.879> uneven<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.600> they're<00:00:52.230> worn<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.770> it's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
already uneven or they're worn if it's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.569 
already uneven or they're worn if it's
an<00:00:53.070> older<00:00:53.309> knife<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.920> either<00:00:56.160> one

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
an older knife and it can be either one

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.660 
an older knife and it can be either one
bushing<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.120> smaller<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> other<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.670> one

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
bushing is smaller than the other or one

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
bushing is smaller than the other or one
bushing<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.210> has<00:01:00.329> uneven<00:01:00.690> wire<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.199> one

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bushing just has uneven wire like one

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369 
bushing just has uneven wire like one
side<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:03.300> thinner<00:01:03.899> than<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> other

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
side is much much thinner than the other

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.340 
side is much much thinner than the other
and<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.610> situation<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.110> have

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and in this situation you know you have

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.080 
and in this situation you know you have
a<00:01:07.380> couple<00:01:07.740> options<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.610> brand<00:01:08.939> new

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
a couple options you can get brand new

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.160 
a couple options you can get brand new
bushings<00:01:09.650> or<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> bushings

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
bushings or you can take the bushings

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
bushings or you can take the bushings
out<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> put<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.369> fine<00:01:14.790> stone

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
out and put them on a very fine stone

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990 
out and put them on a very fine stone
like<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> triangle<00:01:17.369> sharp<00:01:17.790> maker

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like if you have a triangle sharp maker

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
like if you have a triangle sharp maker
the<00:01:18.210> white<00:01:18.390> stones<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.900> perfect<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the white stones are perfect and the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
the white stones are perfect and the
ultrafine<00:01:20.729> stones<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.299> even<00:01:21.509> better<00:01:21.630> because

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
ultrafine stones are even better because

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.480 
ultrafine stones are even better because
once<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.439> move<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> ultra<00:01:23.220> fines

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
once you move up to the ultra fines

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.910 
once you move up to the ultra fines
you'll<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> mirror<00:01:24.479> polish<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> that's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you'll get a mirror polish and that's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.789 
you'll get a mirror polish and that's
more<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.310> performance<00:01:26.790> pimping<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> knife

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
more into performance pimping the knife

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
more into performance pimping the knife
but<00:01:28.799> um<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.869> doing<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but um you know when you're doing that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.469 
but um you know when you're doing that
you<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:31.860> careful<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.820> grind<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you want to be very careful to grind it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
you want to be very careful to grind it
flat<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:34.979> using<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.610> light

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
flat and you do that by using very light

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
flat and you do that by using very light
pressure<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> forth<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.130> then

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pressure just back and forth and then

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
pressure just back and forth and then
checking<00:01:38.579> often<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:40.079> you'll<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
checking often and what you'll see is

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
checking often and what you'll see is
you'll<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.950> shiny<00:01:41.460> spots<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.240> dull<00:01:42.509> spots

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you'll see shiny spots and dull spots

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
you'll see shiny spots and dull spots
those<00:01:43.140> dull<00:01:43.380> spots<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> recession's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
those dull spots are the recession's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
those dull spots are the recession's
that<00:01:44.970> aren't<00:01:45.180> grinding<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.590> want

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that aren't grinding and you just want

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
that aren't grinding and you just want
to<00:01:46.829> keep<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.790> light<00:01:48.210> pressure

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to keep going with very light pressure

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.670 
to keep going with very light pressure
and<00:01:49.170> checking<00:01:49.649> until<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.680> solid

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and checking until it's all one solid

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.490 
and checking until it's all one solid
shade<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> both<00:01:54.840> sides<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
shade and you do that to both sides and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.859 
shade and you do that to both sides and
then<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.759> compare<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> two<00:01:57.479> next<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
then you can compare the two next to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
then you can compare the two next to
each<00:01:57.990> other<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.759> eyeball<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
each other and see you can eyeball it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.770 
each other and see you can eyeball it
you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.390> make<00:02:03.390> sure<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you know it's it's just make sure it's a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
you know it's it's just make sure it's a
slow<00:02:04.020> process<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.280> want<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
slow process you know you don't want to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
slow process you know you don't want to
try<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.969> speed<00:02:06.210> through<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.420> light<00:02:06.869> touch

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
try and speed through it light touch

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.499 
try and speed through it light touch
that<00:02:07.500> way<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:08.009> take<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.879> off<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that way you can take a little off and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
that way you can take a little off and
then<00:02:09.690> check<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.610> sure

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
then check them and make sure

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.699 
then check them and make sure
everything's<00:02:12.150> good<00:02:12.360> there

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.740 

another<00:02:15.709> reason<00:02:15.950> probably<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> most<00:02:17.209> common

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
another reason probably the most common

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
another reason probably the most common
is<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.410> liners<00:02:18.890> are<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:21.250> symmetrical

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
is that the liners are not symmetrical

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.920 
is that the liners are not symmetrical
they're<00:02:22.459> not<00:02:22.640> lined<00:02:23.150> up<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.600> each<00:02:23.630> other

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
they're not lined up with each other

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.590 
they're not lined up with each other
causing<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.220> pivot<00:02:25.610> pin<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.180> slightly

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
causing the pivot pin to be slightly

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.620 
causing the pivot pin to be slightly
off-kilter<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.790> mean<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> may<00:02:29.240> sound<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
off-kilter and I mean it may sound a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.500 
off-kilter and I mean it may sound a
little<00:02:29.660> ridiculous<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.310> true<00:02:32.239> just

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
little ridiculous but it is true just

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.449 
little ridiculous but it is true just
the<00:02:32.630> slightest<00:02:33.230> misalignment<00:02:33.470> over<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.250> can

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
the slightest misalignment over here can

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.290 
the slightest misalignment over here can
cause<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> large<00:02:35.120> amount<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:37.300> in

cause a large amount over here and in

cause a large amount over here and in

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
this situation what you need to do is to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
this situation what you need to do is to
loosen<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.280> pivot<00:02:44.120> screw<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.569> all<00:02:44.720> their

take it apart you know you're Sol but if

shift the liners back and forth a little

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.160 
shift the liners back and forth a little
bit<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.230> try<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.250> shimmy<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.850> blade<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:12.140> the

bit and try and shimmy that blade to the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.340 
bit and try and shimmy that blade to the
center<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:14.060> once<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
center and once you have it in the

center and once you have it in the
center<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:16.370> know<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.850> want<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> hold<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.600> down

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
center you know you want to hold it down

tighten<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.100> pivot<00:03:19.310> screw<00:03:19.549> as<00:03:19.790> much<00:03:20.120> as

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
tighten up the pivot screw as much as

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.449 
tighten up the pivot screw as much as
you<00:03:20.360> can<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.290> gradually<00:03:21.950> tighten<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
you can and then gradually tighten the

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.360 
you can and then gradually tighten the
rest<00:03:22.670> up<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.390> then<00:03:24.200> once<00:03:24.440> these<00:03:25.100> are<00:03:25.160> all

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
rest up and then once these are all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.850 
rest up and then once these are all
tightened<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.329> proper<00:03:26.690> torque<00:03:26.989> then<00:03:27.709> you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
tightened up to proper torque then you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.410 
tightened up to proper torque then you
back<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.280> one<00:03:28.459> off<00:03:28.579> until<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.180> good

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
back this one off until you have good

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.949 
back this one off until you have good
nice<00:03:29.799> fluid<00:03:30.799> motion<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.530> folder<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
nice fluid motion in in the folder the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.360 
nice fluid motion in in the folder the
other<00:03:36.170> method<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:38.890> loosen<00:03:39.890> all<00:03:40.010> these<00:03:40.160> back

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
other method is to loosen all these back

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.420 
other method is to loosen all these back
up<00:03:40.510> leave<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.690> pivot<00:03:41.989> screw<00:03:42.109> loose<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.709> then

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
up leave the pivot screw loose and then

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.729 
up leave the pivot screw loose and then
gradually<00:03:44.299> begin<00:03:44.600> tightening<00:03:44.900> these<00:03:45.320> from

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
gradually begin tightening these from

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.949 
gradually begin tightening these from
back<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.400> front<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:48.079> mean<00:03:48.290> like<00:03:49.250> Snug

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
back to front and I mean like Snug

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.930 
back to front and I mean like Snug
finger<00:03:50.959> tight<00:03:51.140> finger<00:03:51.470> tight<00:03:51.680> tighten<00:03:52.459> snug

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
finger tight finger tight tighten snug

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.470 
finger tight finger tight tighten snug
snug<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.540> know<00:03:53.630> gradually<00:03:54.320> moving<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:54.920> in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
snug you know gradually moving up in

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.970 
snug you know gradually moving up in
progression<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.959> should<00:03:57.290> also<00:03:57.320> solve

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
progression and that should also solve

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.979 
progression and that should also solve
the<00:03:58.190> problem

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
the problem

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.990 
the problem
and<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.590> good<00:04:00.739> thing<00:04:00.920> about<00:04:00.950> those<00:04:01.310> two<00:04:01.579> fixes

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
and the good thing about those two fixes

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.789 
and the good thing about those two fixes
is<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.299> if<00:04:02.450> you're<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> warranty<00:04:03.079> freak<00:04:03.380> you

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
is that if you're a warranty freak you

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.860 
is that if you're a warranty freak you
don't<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.519> open<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:04.940> just<00:04:05.060> loosen

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
don't have to open it you just loosen

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.860 
don't have to open it you just loosen
them<00:04:06.820> personally<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:08.120> know<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.269> think<00:04:08.750> if

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
them personally you know I think if

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.229 
them personally you know I think if
you're<00:04:09.019> not<00:04:09.049> allowed<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.799> open<00:04:10.070> something<00:04:10.489> you

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
you're not allowed to open something you

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.030 
you're not allowed to open something you
don't<00:04:11.420> really<00:04:11.600> own<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.840> but<00:04:12.320> to<00:04:12.859> each<00:04:13.010> their

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
don't really own it but to each their

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.659 
don't really own it but to each their
own<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:15.200> I'm<00:04:15.829> sure<00:04:16.010> as<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.190> can<00:04:16.400> hear<00:04:16.519> my
