the<00:00:25.890> solution<00:00:26.449> which<00:00:27.449> isn't<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:28.019> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the solution which isn't actually as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.700 
the solution which isn't actually as
hard<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:28.980> you'd<00:00:29.340> think

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

location of your clash of clans in my

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.170 
location of your clash of clans in my
case<00:01:22.010> I've<00:01:22.250> sent<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.729> download

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
case I've sent it in to download

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.800 
case I've sent it in to download
BlueStacks<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:25.030> that's<00:01:26.030> where<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.210> saved<00:01:26.690> it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
BlueStacks and that's where I saved it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.030 
BlueStacks and that's where I saved it
anyway<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.229> might<00:01:27.500> save<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.830> somewhere<00:01:27.920> else

anyway you might save it somewhere else

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.230 
anyway you might save it somewhere else
but<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.520> find<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.880> location<00:01:31.150> once<00:01:32.150> you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
but just find the location once you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.900 
but just find the location once you
found<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.530> going<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.920> use<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.250> data<00:01:34.460> input

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.140 
found it you going to use the data input
mapper<00:01:35.479> then<00:01:36.440> in<00:01:36.740> input<00:01:37.310> mapper<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.880> want<00:01:38.060> to
