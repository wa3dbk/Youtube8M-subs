watching scarecrow I was so intrigued
with<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> design<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:16.369> couldn't<00:00:17.369> help<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
with the design I couldn't help it but I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.650 
with the design I couldn't help it but I
had<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> build<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.630> sucker<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> scavenged

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

the<00:01:09.009> plates<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.490> roughly<00:01:10.000> about<00:01:11.189> five<00:01:12.189> and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the plates are roughly about five and

don't<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.350> way<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.590> measure<00:01:24.679> the<00:01:25.070> amperage

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
don't have a way to measure the amperage

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.990 
don't have a way to measure the amperage
except<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.659> blew<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.929> 20<00:01:27.289> amp<00:01:27.439> fuse<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.820> it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
except that I blew a 20 amp fuse and it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.230 
except that I blew a 20 amp fuse and it
threw<00:01:29.149> 25<00:01:29.659> amp<00:01:29.960> fuse<00:01:30.289> in<00:01:30.500> there<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.090> it's<00:01:32.090> been

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
threw 25 amp fuse in there and it's been

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.100 
threw 25 amp fuse in there and it's been
running<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.689> fine<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.549> probably<00:01:35.030> around<00:01:35.179> 22

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
running just fine so probably around 22

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
running just fine so probably around 22
23<00:01:36.590> amps<00:01:37.130> or<00:01:38.530> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.570 

it<00:01:49.560> seems<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.100> bubbling<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.820> good

in my car here no taller by the weekend
about<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.720> couple<00:02:21.050> three<00:02:21.230> days<00:02:22.150> give<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.360> shot

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
about a couple three days give it a shot

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.120 
about a couple three days give it a shot
and<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.110> does<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.040> an

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
and see what it does just for an

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.540 
and see what it does just for an
experiment

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.700
