00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 all the girls who want to have 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.460
 colored hair or colors but 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.890
 who are in mode I do not care about 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.540
 my hair the concept of coloring 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.139
 or fading is not about having 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.509
 a cut to the bruce willis 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 it's the crown way briand he 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.900
 shines because there is no heating 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.020
 on it so here's a must know this 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.020
 we want 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.340
 hello friends I hope you go 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.110
 well I find you today for 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.820
 to talk to you about my hair so it's dated 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.230
 I have to offer this video recently 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.290
 moment since march 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.660
 yes anyway then so it will be a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.500
 very fast video to explain you my 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.720
 hair color 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.610
 keep in mind that the base I had 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.979
 it was a base blonde so for that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.660
 who wanted what they want to know the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.490
 color that I had before I you 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.440
 would put somewhere on the video when 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.700
 I'm talking about my color whether it's my 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.650
 last blond because I had is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.940
 clear if my hair has december or 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.890
 for my red locks 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 they were made by the so-called sites 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 Natural and over which is super awesome 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.840
 I invite you to go lay and his page 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.130
 Facebook 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.930
 it's a girl who is really great 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.399
 gifted she has a lot of talent i love 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.750
 a lot what she did I wanted 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.000
 of change so I want to do 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.300
 red but without removing my side 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.850
 blonde hair 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.770
 so I asked leslie to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.910
 make me red highlights while 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.500
 leaving blond locks 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.000
 so this is a particular result but 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.259
 it's basically what I asked him 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.630
 and I really like 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.280
 I really like you look at me ivory 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.229
 red and I do not know that the wind 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.900
 going through my hair to make a 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.590
 hairstyle and see where my wicks 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.330
 blondes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.549
 in fact it makes me happy no I like 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.450
 really this two-color side that a lot 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.040
 of people can not find weird 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.010
 according to the hairstyle that I can wear 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.840
 but me that's what I wanted here 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.540
 so here I have red streaks a little 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.590
 everywhere for example here I have when 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.420
 even blonde locks 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.750
 I even see red mechs 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.390
 it's quite nuanced I like 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.000
 a lot the rendering of the two mixed so 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 as color I have three quarters of 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.320
 clear chestnut deep red and e cards 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.880
 intense red blonde 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.459
 this is the mix of 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.500
 two so that it goes with my base 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.880
 blonde then I have not done any 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.380
 refreshment of my color that has 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.010
 already many gorges and since 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.079
 I do not do them in March 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.239
 but if I do it it will be with the gloss 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.519
 eugene perma so in fact these are 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.950
 gloss that is exposed and 20 minutes later 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.930
 the shampoo and then we stay here 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.180
 we make his routine go to start chain 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.000
 no matter what you want so for 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.650
 the moment I have not realized yet 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 color because I do not know if I 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060
 will leave my hair red or six 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.670
 will wait for the color of the gorges 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.010
 throats gorges maximum for 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.010
 find blond below I do not know 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.770
 not yet what I had done or if I 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.580
 am going to make a kind of chocolate 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.870
 o'byrne red way I do not know I do not 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.350
 do not know I do not know yet what I 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.580
 will do 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.000
 in any case I am really very 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.170
 happy with the result and the color of 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.480
 my head all that stuff 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.040
 many of you ask me who I am 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.600
 see possibly to cut me 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.820
 hair or for my color that kind of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.360
 things there I'm redirecting you naturally 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.510

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.020
 asterix if you want to get in touch 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.430

 in info bar but you have to know 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.840
 that he is very taken by that because 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.160
 that these devices therefore necessarily 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 a lot of people want that 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.110
 diddy headdress Thursday the headdresses earlier 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.250
 so if you want an appointment they 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.360
 you're going to take it now because 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.770
 I believe that now she is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.190
 available for the month of July it is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.590
 tell you 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.910
 so go already right now for 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.590
 those also you ask me how 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.910
 it happens that I make colors that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.709
 I am going to discolorations and so on and 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.660
 that my hair is not doing well 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.780
 wrong it's very simple two weeks 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.700
 before coloring or staining I 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.519
 do me protein care and so with 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.140
 the smoothing shampoo of the hydra range 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 relaxation of farid abbots that contains 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.549
 proteins also finally making me some 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.880
 masks before my shampoo with by 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.050
 example coconut oil avocado oil 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.130
 I give him rice protein or 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.260
 silk proteins 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.780
 this is the famous fire care proteins and 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.280
 So it is two weeks before the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.260
 colorations with the colorations that I make 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.020
 this care so once a week so 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.970
 I do this treatment twice before the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.860
 colorations with colorations and after 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.900
 discoloration or staining 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.520
 I do not hesitate to treat myself 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.250
 deep for example I had used the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.580
 mask hydra force of farid abbots the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.250
 night mask where I'm going to use the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.690
 deep and secret mask of the oly who 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.790
 is lemon something like that 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.410
 here and in fact I will not hesitate 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.450
 if I feel that my hair is tired 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.400
 to make me two deep masks by 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.430
 week so here we go 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.320
 deep masco and co h for example if 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.330
 I made my color 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.250
 my color or fading on saturday 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.080
 and that say I see my hair 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.990
 are tired batchelor puts a care 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.199
 deep so deep care so care 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.629
 before shampoo shampoo after 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.259
 shampoos masks and then I 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.840
 do my routine 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.969
 so I have a deep care routine 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.259
 how living room that is on my channel I 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.789
 you would put the video somewhere or 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.490
 if they would also be fake 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.620
 but so here I do not hesitate if there is 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.150
 Although my fading color I 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.879
 see that my hair is kind of super 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.610
 tired of deep care sailing in general 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.520
 if I do deep caring the week to 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.069
 the week of games hell 1 1 and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.629
 then I will follow deep care 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:49.930
 every week or every ten 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.430
 days 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.310
 in general things I recover well 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.930
 that's it so I also want to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.060
 do a little parenthesis and to you 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.710
 to say that all girls who want 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.900
 to have colored or discolored hair 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.090
 but who are in mode I do not think 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.889
 care of my hair the concept of the 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.199
 staining or discoloration this is 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.370
 not to have a cup at the willis bruce 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.419
 and that's the skull in a brilliant way 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.580
 libri because there is no bedside 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.659
 on it so here's one to know what 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.430
 we want if you want hair 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.740
 colorful and at the same time healthy 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.870
 you have to put the sounds you need to 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.240
 to have the patience one has to do when I 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.310
 say it all the time we do not have all the 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.690
 same heritage we are not all equal 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.430
 in all that there are girls who go 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.289
 to make repetitive discolorations 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.940
 who have jockey hair that have 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.469
 hair that keeps all that stuff and 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.449
 do not need to care this 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.500
 is not a majority 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.599
 here we go we do not forget to 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.089
 to care or if one is a 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.699
 flemish and that we want color either 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.120
 we have no problem with skulls 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.210
 shaved 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.599
 either we do not make any colors 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.580
 simply 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.839
 in fact this is it sounds a bit 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.250
 annoying for the end of the video 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:55.930
 but I had to say because 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.419
 coloration of colorations is not 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.900
 necessarily synonymous with hair in 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.870
 decline 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.979
 this is me, I make you fat 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.360
 kisses and I tell you next time 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:06.360
 in another video lease 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.800
 a few weeks
