00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.860
 academy welcomes you again 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.700
 in this video I will be working with 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.070
 a quick animated view of section of 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.100
 an object then we will start from the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 creation of two views for this 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.190
 we will enable in our tape the view 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 point we will be enabling enable 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.680
 section and when we enable inei bold 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 section automatically enables a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 contextual window that allows me 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.440
 work with two types of work with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 flat or with a box view in this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 view of story plans with six planes 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 available to create the view of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 section that I want and save it as 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.380
 a view saved then I'm going to start 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.660
 with this plane 6 activated in this plane 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.140
 who are watching on screen and with this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.530
 flat in 6 activated I'm going to set a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 initial view in this initial view I'm going 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 to look at what is the distance at which 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 it's found 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.870
 the object is here at point 15 in 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.300
 our x axis then I'm going to put a 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.110
 little closer I'll put point 12 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.110
 for example 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.159
 that is close to the object before 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.159
 to start cutting and at this time 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.700
 I will make my first saved cut view 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 so I place it where I want it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 begin to see the cut 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 can be here almost facing 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.210
 in this first view and at this moment 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.960
 He took the photo that is that I created the view 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.040
 to put 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.040
 section 1 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.549
 and then I proceed 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.490
 place it in the second position where 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.800
 I want the cut to be then 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.160
 let's say for the second position 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.920
 I'm going to get closer to the object and I'm going to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.530
 displace 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.530
 the position of the plane to zero point 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.920
 and at that point 0 is cutting 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.330
 exactly half of my object 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
 then I will locate it here 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.230
 and I'm going to create the second view then 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.230
 took the picture I put section 2 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.020
 and with this pair of sections I'm going to create 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.360
 a simple animation then I wanted a 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.710
 new animation the animation can be 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.050
 I'll travel it 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.190
 in this tour what I'm going to do is 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.640
 link the two sections to the route 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.040
 then he took the two pair of sections 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.800
 I put them on top of the route and I'm going to 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.240
 test how is the view of this 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.720
 animation then I will choose the and 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.480
 after they choose it I will apply the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 animation then look at the plane going 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.090
 doing the tour and cutting the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.090
 custom-made object 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.120
 advancing the ready time begins at 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.120
 make the cut 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.810
 and in this way I can encourage a 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.239
 section view to show the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.330
 inside of a product that I am 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.690
 designing this animation ready and I 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.959
 I can save, I can make it and produce it 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.549
 with a video then here in output 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.530
 can I click on animation in 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.440
 animation I'm going to say what kind of 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.470
 animation I'm going to 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.450
 and take out said that the scene that is 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.099
 at present 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.769
 in animation I do not tell you it happens in 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.660
 animation simply here in the 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.190
 rendering I'm going to say it's in the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.989
 window 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.780
 the format is going to be the rest of the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.090
 Other formats are formats of 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.919
 images to subsequently produce in 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.669
 another program and I simply choose 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.940
 window xavi and I will leave my window such 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.120
 and since there are 15 frames per second it is 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.870
 enough to put a good sharpness 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.910
 and I just say ok ok i 'm going to say 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.260
 As I want it to remain I will choose what 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.250
 animation is saved 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.060
 in the cde soon in my videos I'm going to 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.689
 put here inside julian I'm going to put 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.889
 here my video 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.889
 I will say here 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.530
 I would exchange with animated court 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.840
 and I'm going to put it to keep him 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.840
 just start producing it 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.370
 it is not as delayed as one would think 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.280
 to do the animation yourself action 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.830
 cut the truth and once it is done 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.780
 we can run it and we can put it in 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.930
 any place that 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.340
 that we need it and send it soon 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.860
 video to the customer so he can look at the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.570
 how the object is being animated 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.580
 then if I go I check my objects 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:45.100
 around here I find the animation that I just 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.100
 to save and here in the animation 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.010
 I'm going to see the animated cut that I just 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.010
 save 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.819
 then in this way it is easy to start 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.870
 of a pair of views create a cut 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:04.270
 animated with navisworks in a next 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.340
 video we could be working the 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.250
 linkage of this type of animations 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.949
 of sequence with animation 4 of which 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.210
 it is also totally possible I hope that 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:19.270
 you liked this this little video 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.120
 with this tutorial on how to make a 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.120
 seen in animated section I hope to see you 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.760
 soon 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.160
 in our videos from our blog 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.930
 academy in my name julian chic there 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.169
 another application engineer from here 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.320
 academy I hope to see you soon 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.320
 then
