you just want to run out and save it
well<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.149> opportunity<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
well I actually get the opportunity to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.119 
well I actually get the opportunity to
save<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.800> so

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.369 

see<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.550> he's<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.239> stuck<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
see see so he's actually stuck in the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
see see so he's actually stuck in the
egg<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.850> how<00:00:59.940> his<00:01:00.120> head<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.960> he<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.260> axe

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
egg you see how his head so he could axe

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
egg you see how his head so he could axe
he<00:01:01.680> can't<00:01:01.980> pull<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.430> he<00:01:02.670> can't<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.059> anything<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
he can't pull in he can't do anything so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
he can't pull in he can't do anything so
this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.739> exactly<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> many<00:01:06.090> reasons

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this is exactly one of the many reasons

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
this is exactly one of the many reasons
why<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.869> cut<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:09.060> guy<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.540> would

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
why we cut them so this guy here would

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.300 
why we cut them so this guy here would
just<00:01:09.720> literally<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.650> egg<00:01:10.860> dried<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
just literally that this egg dried it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
just literally that this egg dried it
out<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.360> would<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.659> suffocate<00:01:13.200> him

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
out at all it would just suffocate him

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
out at all it would just suffocate him
because<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> hole<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.100> smaller<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
because a hole would get smaller and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.859 
because a hole would get smaller and
smaller<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> little<00:01:18.210> anxious<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
smaller so he got a little anxious and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.950 
smaller so he got a little anxious and
pushed<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.420> exactly

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
pushed out see that so that's exactly

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.499 
pushed out see that so that's exactly
why<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.470> cut<00:01:22.680> eggs<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> reasons<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
why we cut eggs one of the reasons the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
why we cut eggs one of the reasons the
other<00:01:24.630> reasons<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.259> cut<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.070> pull<00:01:26.369> back

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
other reasons they cut it they pull back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
other reasons they cut it they pull back
in<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.200> end<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
in like that get on the other end and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.789 
in like that get on the other end and
drowned<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:30.890> snot<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.799> anyway

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
drowned in the in those snot so anyway

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.260 
drowned in the in those snot so anyway
that's<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> some<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> reasons<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.060> cut

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's the some of the reasons we cut

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.790 
that's the some of the reasons we cut
eggs

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.130 

this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.000> beautiful<00:01:42.240> outline<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this is some beautiful outline as it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.320 
this is some beautiful outline as it
looks<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.820> covered

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
looks here this one here is just covered

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.780 
looks here this one here is just covered
with<00:01:45.360> cuts<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.960> over<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.260> egg<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
with cuts all over the egg but could you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
with cuts all over the egg but could you
see<00:01:47.940> how<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.900> they<00:01:49.020> can't<00:01:49.260> breathe<00:01:49.530> if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
see how that's see they can't breathe if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
see how that's see they can't breathe if
they<00:01:49.860> take<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> breath<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.120> stuck<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.540> out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
they take a breath and get stuck in out

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
they take a breath and get stuck in out
that's<00:01:52.020> over<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.570> like<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.720> said

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that's over and so that's like I said

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.540 
that's over and so that's like I said
that's<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> main<00:01:55.650> reasons<00:01:56.100> why<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.250> do

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
that's one of the main reasons why we do

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.470 
that's one of the main reasons why we do
it<00:01:57.320> we're<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.650> hurry<00:01:59.090> we<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.270> wait

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
it we're not in a hurry we can wait
