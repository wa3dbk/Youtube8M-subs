00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.590
 First, go to the next page 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.739
 well we go to the megaupload page and we wait 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.230

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.559
 I put pause ja ja now that the 44 seconds passed we downloaded it 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.890
 as you can see it's already downloaded now what they have to do is run turn and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.650
 minimize it like this 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 they look for the folder where they downloaded it they open the program and they execute in file 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.420
 called to be there pointed exe and a window like this will appear 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.960

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.050
 information remember that I made this video so they do not start with their 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.170
 stupid questions that if I did them or something like that I say goodbye I'm inquisitor 95
