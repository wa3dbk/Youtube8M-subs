00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.800 

now<00:00:18.520> basically<00:00:18.790> what<00:00:19.150> I'm<00:00:19.270> doing<00:00:19.300> is<00:00:19.690> I'm

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
now basically what I'm doing is I'm

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.350 
now basically what I'm doing is I'm
working<00:00:20.020> from<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.580> lower<00:00:21.760> end<00:00:21.970> here<00:00:22.240> I'm

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
working from in the lower end here I'm

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.780 
working from in the lower end here I'm
working<00:00:22.510> from<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.440> minor<00:00:23.800> pentatonic<00:00:24.100> so

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
working from the a minor pentatonic so

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.109 
working from the a minor pentatonic so
it<00:00:25.240> looks<00:00:25.420> like<00:00:25.630> basically<00:00:25.950> three<00:00:27.090> three<00:00:28.090> zero

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
it looks like basically three three zero

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.180 
it looks like basically three three zero
three<00:00:28.960> zero<00:00:29.040> two<00:00:30.040> zero<00:00:30.340> two<00:00:30.490> zero<00:00:30.970> two<00:00:32.190> one

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
three zero two zero two zero two one

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.369 
three zero two zero two zero two one
zero<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.820> then<00:00:34.270> three<00:00:34.510> zero<00:00:34.780> so<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.170> looks

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
zero and then three zero so it looks

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.369 
zero and then three zero so it looks
like<00:00:35.440> this<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:40.330> that's<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.690> blue<00:00:40.900> scale<00:00:41.199> it's

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
like this and that's the blue scale it's

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.780 
like this and that's the blue scale it's
got<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.620> extra<00:00:41.860> note<00:00:42.100> in<00:00:42.190> there<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.430> flatted

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
got that extra note in there the flatted

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.569 
got that extra note in there the flatted
fifth

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.319 

and<00:00:49.180> if<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.290> go<00:00:50.440> up<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.860> next<00:00:51.040> position<00:00:51.640> it

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
and if you go up to the next position it

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.569 
and if you go up to the next position it
would<00:00:52.480> be<00:00:52.660> five<00:00:53.050> three<00:00:53.559> five<00:00:53.890> three<00:00:53.920> four

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
would be five three five three four

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.780 
would be five three five three four
three<00:00:54.940> two<00:00:55.270> five<00:00:55.989> two<00:00:56.290> five<00:00:56.320> two<00:00:56.680> five<00:00:57.309> three

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
three two five two five two five three

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.310 
three two five two five two five three
zero<00:00:57.820> which<00:00:58.750> would<00:00:58.930> be

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.300 

so<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.860> sorts<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.250> things

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so you can do all sorts of things

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
so you can do all sorts of things
tagging<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.180> two<00:01:09.420> scales<00:01:09.810> together<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
tagging those two scales together and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
tagging those two scales together and
some<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> things<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.119> doing<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.570> for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
some of the things I was doing there for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.490 
some of the things I was doing there for
the<00:01:13.350> intro<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:14.490> things<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
grab you're gonna grab the second string

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.179 
grab you're gonna grab the second string
of<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.610> third<00:01:32.850> fret

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189
