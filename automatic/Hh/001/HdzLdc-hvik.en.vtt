00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.960 

hmm

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.330 

it's<00:02:09.970> owned<00:02:10.510> by<00:02:10.540> goons<00:02:10.990> gone<00:02:14.010> they<00:02:15.010> hang<00:02:15.220> get

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
it's owned by goons gone they hang get

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:35.880 
it's owned by goons gone they hang get
ready<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.790> attack

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:45.250 

Oh

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:56.160 

and<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.250> should<00:02:46.610> be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:09.790 

close<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> end<00:02:57.430> here

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.120
