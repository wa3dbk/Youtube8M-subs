00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.359
 and because otherwise it looks like conventional 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.449
 same front and back that is not possible 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.579
 therefore also vehicles front and rear are different from 4 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.259

 For this you need a moped driver's license in the middle of the fifties 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.650
 this microcar was designed for the family of four and 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 actually offers its unusual shape with the engine in between 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 Benches Amazing Space and Legroom 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.590
 but that was not enough for a success story 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
 6900 copies were from the band then was closing time 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.350

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.260
 what a shame 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.829
 He still has so many advantages 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.219
 Just think about the second driver that's downright 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.540
 revolutionary 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.230

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.979
 not agree something comparable in the history of the automobile
