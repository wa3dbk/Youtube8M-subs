llm we pick up sierra in a minute which

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.229 
llm we pick up sierra in a minute which
i'll<00:02:54.989> explain<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.620> also<00:02:56.010> Gnabry<00:02:56.579> comes<00:02:57.090> in

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.509 
i'll explain but also Gnabry comes in
shortly<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.840> i<00:02:58.319> believe<00:02:58.889> this<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.069> alone<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
shortly on i believe this one alone and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.250 
shortly on i believe this one alone and
I<00:02:59.549> did<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.269> knew<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.599> had<00:03:00.780> high

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I did this because I knew they had high

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.569 
I did this because I knew they had high
potential<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.010> didn't<00:03:02.189> really<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.459> of

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
potential and I didn't really know of

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.920 
potential and I didn't really know of
many<00:03:02.669> other<00:03:02.909> players<00:03:03.209> obviously<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.689> new

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
many other players obviously I new

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
many other players obviously I new
arsenal<00:03:04.169> players<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:04.650> good<00:03:04.799> potential<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.489> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
arsenal players with good potential so I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.819 
arsenal players with good potential so I
picked<00:03:06.599> them<00:03:06.689> up<00:03:06.810> as<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.169> see<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.469> you

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
picked them up as you see there you

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.770 
picked them up as you see there you
shoulda<00:03:08.129> went<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.459> 1.4<00:03:09.000> mil<00:03:09.239> would<00:03:09.599> have<00:03:09.689> been

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
shoulda went for 1.4 mil would have been

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.809 
shoulda went for 1.4 mil would have been
very<00:03:09.900> useful<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.859> be<00:03:10.980> very<00:03:11.159> useful<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.669> our

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
very useful will be very useful in our

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.220 
very useful will be very useful in our
transfer<00:03:12.060> pledges<00:03:12.599> we<00:03:12.750> go<00:03:12.840> into<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.109> next

game<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.919> against<00:03:14.489> west<00:03:14.849> ham<00:03:14.969> and<00:03:15.299> for<00:03:15.750> some

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
game up against west ham and for some

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.080 
game up against west ham and for some
reason<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.319> still<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.919> for<00:03:17.129> kobo<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.699> the<00:03:17.879> right

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
reason I still and for kobo as the right

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.379 
reason I still and for kobo as the right
back<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.479> hadn't<00:03:18.930> switched<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.349> up<00:03:19.639> but<00:03:20.639> I<00:03:20.970> think

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
back I hadn't switched it up but I think

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.909 
back I hadn't switched it up but I think
Bertrand<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.019> think<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.349> end<00:03:22.500> up<00:03:22.560> playing<00:03:22.769> him

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
Bertrand I think I end up playing him

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.280 
Bertrand I think I end up playing him
there<00:03:22.949> eventually<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.519> Casco<00:03:24.479> was<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.109> our

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
there eventually but Casco was in our

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.780 
there eventually but Casco was in our
left<00:03:25.500> back<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.250> was<00:03:26.340> basically<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
left back and that was basically the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.759 
left back and that was basically the
only<00:03:26.970> change<00:03:27.449> in<00:03:27.629> Casco<00:03:28.079> scored<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.620> his<00:03:28.739> debut

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769

only change in Casco scored on his debut
absolutely<00:03:29.549> brilliant<00:03:29.849> there<00:03:29.970> made<00:03:30.449> it<00:03:30.540> 1-1

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
absolutely brilliant there made it 1-1

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
absolutely brilliant there made it 1-1
against<00:03:31.229> west<00:03:31.470> ham<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.949> that<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:32.909> a<00:03:32.939> little

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
against west ham and that was a little

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.699 
against west ham and that was a little
bit<00:03:33.180> worried<00:03:33.419> because<00:03:33.540> similar<00:03:34.260> weight<00:03:34.409> can

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
bit worried because similar weight can

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.860 
bit worried because similar weight can
be<00:03:34.739> very<00:03:35.010> tricky<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.459> Qart<00:03:35.790> does<00:03:36.479> give<00:03:36.720> them

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
be very tricky in Qart does give them

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.719 
be very tricky in Qart does give them
the<00:03:36.989> lead<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.349> 55th<00:03:37.859> minute<00:03:38.099> Jenkinson

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
comes on for them but i accidentally

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.830

76 minute equaliser which can be very

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
free rated player I know 300 Kate but he

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.960 
free rated player I know 300 Kate but he
goes<00:03:55.019> up<00:03:55.229> to<00:03:55.349> like<00:03:55.379> 80<00:03:55.769> has<00:03:56.159> incredible<00:03:56.729> growth

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
goes up to like 80 has incredible growth

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.280

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.979 
so for me that would have been a good
deal<00:04:19.620> because<00:04:19.889> obviously<00:04:20.479> nabari<00:04:21.479> again<00:04:21.810> has

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
deal because obviously nabari again has

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.379 
deal because obviously nabari again has
a<00:04:22.019> really<00:04:22.289> high<00:04:22.349> potential<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.969> just

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
a really high potential and I just

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.060 
a really high potential and I just
thought<00:04:24.539> it'd<00:04:24.659> be<00:04:24.690> really<00:04:25.110> really<00:04:25.680> good<00:04:25.800> but

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
thought it'd be really really good but

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.320 
thought it'd be really really good but
they<00:04:26.190> actually<00:04:26.250> rejected<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.940> first

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
they actually rejected the first

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.779 
they actually rejected the first
and<00:04:27.629> I<00:04:27.689> then<00:04:28.050> decided<00:04:28.409> that<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.039> didn't<00:04:29.699> really

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
and I then decided that I didn't really

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.670 
and I then decided that I didn't really
want<00:04:30.030> my<00:04:30.150> yuca<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.659> had<00:04:30.750> enough<00:04:30.990> strikers<00:04:31.470> now<00:04:31.650> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
want my yuca I had enough strikers now I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.860 
want my yuca I had enough strikers now I
had<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:32.009> couple<00:04:32.220> like<00:04:32.419> options<00:04:33.419> there<00:04:33.659> and<00:04:33.840> I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
had a couple like options there and I

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.070 
had a couple like options there and I
think<00:04:34.530> about<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:34.949> 200k<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.819> my<00:04:36.569> UK<00:04:36.840> there<00:04:36.960> we

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
think about for 200k and my UK there we

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.540 
think about for 200k and my UK there we
go<00:04:37.199> so<00:04:37.379> it<00:04:37.469> have<00:04:37.560> been<00:04:37.650> happy<00:04:37.889> for<00:04:37.919> my<00:04:38.129> Yuka<00:04:38.400> to

but I think in the long run he will end

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.580 
but I think in the long run he will end
up<00:05:03.270> being<00:05:03.509> worth<00:05:03.659> it<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.259> the<00:05:04.379> last

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
