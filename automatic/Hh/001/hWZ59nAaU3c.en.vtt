00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.800
 in a good apparatus like ponds and it 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.930
 know in the beat now we meet 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.369
 in the government of a new server for 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.250
 mike crapo who said in another point of 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.349
 10.5 the server guys between games of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.880
 hungry and is very cool because apart from 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.590
 have the hunger games the server 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.050
 like mixing hunger games with 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.470
 bridges is worth the wonder with the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.000
 mode because it bridges pc 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.949
 Go see it, I'll follow it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.330
 showing then the first thing that 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.890
 have to do is have the version of 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.650
 minecraft that they told zero point of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.080
 10.5 and then if the button comes here 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.780
 of play that where it says this one 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.690
 where Edith says they give it before tender and 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.549
 because they come to Andrew here they wait 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.239
 to load them the numbers guys were 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.610
 the letters erase this is worth of erasures and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 they put the ip that I'm going to leave them or 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 they can copy it here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 ok it would be this I'm writing 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.550
 ok that would be the ip give in everything and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.840
 they leave it like this to whoever says server 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.760
 name you can put the name that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.160
 you want for example I'm going to 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 put pvp and give it where it says add 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.240
 server or server uses 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 ok you would have it here as you see here 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.350
 they would already have and the only thing they have to 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.560
 to do is enter guys here they have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.950
 what to expect is worth let's see if it leaves me 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.780
 get in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.939
 and as you see here I let myself in 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 excuse me if you see bad resolution or 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.500
 if it looks like it would be rare as 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.119
 all colors mixed but could 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 and is someone who watching and does not record 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.140
 it also then as well 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.490
 we are in doing see and then to enter 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.590
 the party just have to register 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.510
 with the command that you can tell 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.830
 then it's worth you give in 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.800
 bar and they put him network so they give him network 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.280
 here you can see it there says ex bars 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.170
 and then they impose the password, and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.850
 because there it is and they would already be registered 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.750
 and all they have to do is 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.540
 come here to where these gentlemen 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.850
 it is worth coming to where these witnesses and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.550
 just touch what's worth they have it 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 touch and then they would send it to a 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.780
 game is there in the game that 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.150
 they have to do so they give it two minutes 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.550
 to gather good things for 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.090
 collect things and when this way 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.470
 two minutes since it is like everything pvp 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.360
 so you have to go to 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.310
 look for you can look for things to 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200
 survive when it comes minus two 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.060
 minutes everything is pvp and you can kill the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 last one that wins and then the games 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 of hunger are very much the boys 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.700
 so, nothing like they see 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.800
 servers are empty at this time already 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.050
 at night they are like nine then 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
 Well, no lies are 6 o'clock in the afternoon and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.150
 that would be all for the video now 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.770
 disk as if you see more resolution already 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.480
 They know they had a network, because it's never going to 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.450
 see guys well and proof of this would be 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.230
 all I say goodbye bye 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 i
