need another fusion rifle but let's go
in<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.340> take<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.490> look<00:01:43.580> at<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.510> can

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
in and take a look at it and you can

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
in and take a look at it and you can
reforge<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.140> thing<00:01:45.320> right<00:01:45.530> reforge<00:01:46.040> ready

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
reforge this thing right reforge ready

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.910 
reforge this thing right reforge ready
there<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.640> go<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:47.000> i'll<00:01:47.750> start<00:01:48.020> off<00:01:48.080> 331<00:01:48.710> you

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
there you go and i'll start off 331 you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.460 
there you go and i'll start off 331 you
play<00:01:49.100> through<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> client<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.820> got<00:01:49.940> 365<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:50.990> the
