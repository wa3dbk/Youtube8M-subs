00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
of adventure and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.980 
of adventure and
what<00:02:28.790> noise<00:02:29.000> said<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.569> big<00:02:29.750> song<00:02:29.960> and

what noise said to be a big song and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.520 
what noise said to be a big song and
then<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.130 

hi<00:02:34.069> disbeliever<00:02:34.850> was<00:02:35.569> another<00:02:35.810> song<00:02:36.110> that

hi disbeliever was another song that
just<00:02:36.380> sort<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.680> seemed<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.130> work

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
just sort of seemed to work

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320 
just sort of seemed to work
yeah<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.470> mean<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:41.070> different<00:02:41.880> these<00:02:42.000> days

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
yeah I mean it's different these days

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 
yeah I mean it's different these days
like<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.860> way<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> internet<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
like because of the way the internet and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.280 
like because of the way the internet and
everything<00:02:44.700> obstruction<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:46.020> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
everything obstruction it's not like I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
everything obstruction it's not like I
mean<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> radio<00:02:46.920> heat<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.310> still<00:02:47.550> good<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.120> have

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
mean a radio heat is still good to have

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.820 
mean a radio heat is still good to have
in<00:02:48.300> another<00:02:48.900> country<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.350> obviously<00:02:49.740> that

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
in another country and obviously that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.480 
in another country and obviously that
spreads<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.850> beyond<00:02:51.600> your<00:02:51.780> own<00:02:51.810> fan<00:02:52.200> base<00:02:53.210> but

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
spreads to beyond your own fan base but

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.250 
spreads to beyond your own fan base but
yeah<00:02:56.490> we<00:02:56.640> find<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> same<00:02:57.360> still<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
yeah we find that the same still the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
yeah we find that the same still the
same<00:02:58.470> songs<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.180> over

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
same songs that get you know like over

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.300 
same songs that get you know like over
there<00:03:00.870> prisoner<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.620> all<00:03:01.740> torn<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.250> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
there prisoner and all torn down and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.670 
there prisoner and all torn down and
white<00:03:02.940> noise<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.450> stuff<00:03:03.690> they<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
white noise and stuff they kind of you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
white noise and stuff they kind of you
know<00:03:04.710> those<00:03:04.920> seem<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.190> still<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> big

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
know those seem to still get the big

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.210 
know those seem to still get the big
reaction<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.800> don't<00:03:08.190> know

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
reaction just because I don't know

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
reaction just because I don't know
because<00:03:08.280> we've<00:03:08.550> made<00:03:08.700> film<00:03:09.270> clips<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.720> them

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
because we've made film clips for them

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.300 
because we've made film clips for them
and<00:03:09.930> stuff<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.709> they<00:03:10.800> just<00:03:10.830> travel

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
and stuff like that so they just travel

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.910 
and stuff like that so they just travel
a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.430> further<00:03:11.730> than<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> album<00:03:12.450> tracks

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
a little further than the album tracks

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.140 
a little further than the album tracks
so<00:03:13.920> it's<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.280> bit<00:03:14.490> easier<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.120> to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
so it's a little bit easier now to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.730 
so it's a little bit easier now to
spread<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> love<00:03:15.870> around<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.260> world<00:03:16.440> than<00:03:16.620> it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
spread the love around the world than it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.000 
spread the love around the world than it
was<00:03:16.920> when<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.340> guys<00:03:17.550> first<00:03:17.880> started<00:03:18.000> out<00:03:19.010> it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
was when you guys first started out it's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.710 
was when you guys first started out it's
easier<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:20.700> harder<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.360> there's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
easier but it's harder because there's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140 
easier but it's harder because there's
so<00:03:21.959> many<00:03:22.170> people<00:03:22.470> try<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.760> same<00:03:23.940> thing

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so many people try to do what same thing

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.180 
so many people try to do what same thing
putting<00:03:24.390> their<00:03:24.630> music<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.620> stuff<00:03:25.800> out<00:03:26.010> there

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
putting their music and stuff out there

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.979 
putting their music and stuff out there
it's<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.180> whole<00:03:27.330> ocean<00:03:27.600> of

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
it's just like it's a whole ocean of

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.410 
it's just like it's a whole ocean of
noise<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.220> know<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.580> can<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:29.850> lost<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.300> it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
noise you know you can get lost in it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.930 
noise you know you can get lost in it
but<00:03:30.630> it's<00:03:31.110> definitely<00:03:31.350> easier<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.580> to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
but it's definitely easier to just to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.699 
but it's definitely easier to just to
spread<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.300> message<00:03:33.330> yet<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:34.590> we

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
spread the message yet and then when we

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.290 
spread the message yet and then when we
first<00:03:35.010> started<00:03:35.160> tutoring<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.940> stuff<00:03:36.150> there

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
first started tutoring and stuff there

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.840 
first started tutoring and stuff there
was<00:03:36.420> no<00:03:36.570> Facebook<00:03:37.130> wasn't<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.250> wouldn't<00:03:38.580> even

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
was no Facebook wasn't I wouldn't even

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.670

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
have laptops or anything did we find all

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680 
have laptops or anything did we find all
those<00:03:40.800> first<00:03:41.070> few<00:03:41.250> tours<00:03:41.550> not<00:03:42.330> even<00:03:42.540> mobile

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
those first few tours not even mobile
