raft<00:00:07.189> insert<00:00:08.330> yeah<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.719> retrofit<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.530> over<00:00:10.830> my

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
raft insert yeah to retrofit it over my

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430 
raft insert yeah to retrofit it over my
dado<00:00:11.340> blade<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.940> which<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.960> great<00:00:13.200> it

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
dado blade and which is great it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.169 
dado blade and which is great it
actually<00:00:13.769> works<00:00:13.950> perfectly<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
actually works perfectly for that at the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
actually works perfectly for that at the
slots<00:00:15.480> cut<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> thin<00:00:17.130> curved<00:00:17.460> blade

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
slots cut but for this thin curved blade

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
slots cut but for this thin curved blade
the<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.199> comes<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:21.320> it<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.680> know

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the one that comes with it it you know

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
the one that comes with it it you know
it's<00:00:23.250> okay<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.060> great<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> needs

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's okay it's great it's what it needs

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
it's okay it's great it's what it needs
it<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.430> problem<00:00:26.670> being<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it to be the problem being is is that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
it to be the problem being is is that
I'm<00:00:27.930> finding<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.160> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> stuff<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I'm finding that a lot of stuff is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.120 
I'm finding that a lot of stuff is
falling<00:00:30.420> down<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.960> thought<00:00:31.199> maybe<00:00:31.890> I'll

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
falling down so I thought maybe I'll

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.479 
falling down so I thought maybe I'll
order<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> couple<00:00:32.880> more<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.360> zero<00:00:33.780> clearance

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
order a couple more for zero clearance

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.100 
order a couple more for zero clearance
insert<00:00:35.960> for<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.170> making<00:00:37.969> standard<00:00:39.110> cuts

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
insert for when I'm making standard cuts

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
insert for when I'm making standard cuts
the<00:00:40.800> problem<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> use<00:00:41.700> my<00:00:41.910> riving

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the problem is is that I use my riving

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
the problem is is that I use my riving
knife<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> time<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> riving<00:00:43.739> knife

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
knife all the time the riving knife

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
knife all the time the riving knife
helps<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.430> kickback<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> pieces

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
helps for kickback so that the pieces

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.220 
helps for kickback so that the pieces
don't<00:00:46.350> touch<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> rise

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
don't touch as you know and when I rise

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
don't touch as you know and when I rise
no<00:00:49.739> rip<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.730> problem<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> goes

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
no rip the problem you know it goes

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.189 
no rip the problem you know it goes
along<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> blade<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.989> a

along with the blade so if you put in a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.010

let me show you how I did that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
let me show you how I did that
what<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.150> took<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.610> actual<00:01:39.060> cut

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
what I did is I took the the actual cut

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
what I did is I took the the actual cut
mark<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> saw<00:01:40.740> did<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.850> just

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
mark that the saw did and then just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
mark that the saw did and then just
literally<00:01:42.479> took<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.649> add<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.250> think

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
literally took it and add it on I think

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.380 
literally took it and add it on I think
it's<00:01:44.579> total<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.350> added<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> full<00:01:47.390> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it's total I added it on to a full it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
it's total I added it on to a full it
looks<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.720> 11<00:01:49.140> inches<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> looks

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
looks like 11 inches is what it looks

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.380 
looks like 11 inches is what it looks
like<00:01:50.100> everyone<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> did<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.130> just

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
like everyone so what I did is I just

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.490 
like everyone so what I did is I just
extended<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> cut<00:01:54.810> line<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.380> down

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
extended that cut line all the way down

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.030 
extended that cut line all the way down
to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> 11<00:01:56.340> inch<00:01:56.490> mark<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.969> both<00:01:57.630> sides<00:01:58.040> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to the 11 inch mark on both sides so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480 
to the 11 inch mark on both sides so
then<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.310> had<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.719> saw<00:02:00.719> cut<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> pencil

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
then I had the saw cut and then I pencil

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.510 
then I had the saw cut and then I pencil
lined<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.240> kerf<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.829> guess<00:02:05.100> there's<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
lined the kerf and I guess there's a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
lined the kerf and I guess there's a
couple<00:02:05.579> ways<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.329> could<00:02:06.570> cut<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
couple ways that you could cut the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.719 
couple ways that you could cut the
section<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.740> mean<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> can't<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.520> with

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
section out I mean you can't go on with

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.330 
section out I mean you can't go on with
a<00:02:08.759> bandsaw<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.720> would<00:02:09.840> ruin<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.349> so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a bandsaw because it would ruin it so

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
a bandsaw because it would ruin it so
what<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> did<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.330> drilled<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> hole<00:02:13.170> he

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
what I did is I drilled on a hole he

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.290 
what I did is I drilled on a hole he
here<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.390> armed<00:02:15.740> right<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:17.130> wear<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.760> line

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
here and armed right to wear the line

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
here and armed right to wear the line
mark<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.100> did<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.790> I'm

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
mark is and what I did is is that I'm

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
mark is and what I did is is that I'm
sure<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.270> could<00:02:21.450> probably<00:02:21.720> stick<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.410> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
sure you could probably stick in a you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.490 
sure you could probably stick in a you
know<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.700> couple<00:02:24.330> different<00:02:24.690> maybe<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.990> skill

sauce<00:02:25.770> if<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.000> did<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.300> I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
sauce if like that but what I did is I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.460 
sauce if like that but what I did is I
actually<00:02:27.540> brought<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.080> over<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.380> he<00:02:28.860> um<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually brought it over to he um to the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually brought it over to he um to the
scroll<00:02:31.800> saw<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.580> was<00:02:32.610> able<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:36.150> read<00:02:36.390> on

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
scroll saw and I was able to the read on

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.930 
scroll saw and I was able to the read on
it's<00:02:37.080> less<00:02:37.560> fun<00:02:37.830> doing<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.220> was<00:02:38.430> one-handed

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it's less fun doing this was one-handed

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.380 
it's less fun doing this was one-handed
I<00:02:39.300> was<00:02:39.720> able<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.020> thread<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> blade<00:02:41.390> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
I was able to thread on the blade and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.910 
I was able to thread on the blade and
let's<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.320> move<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.590> over<00:02:43.770> here

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
let's see if we can move this over here

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.640 
let's see if we can move this over here
went<00:02:44.160> over<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:45.959> kind<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
went over so as you see here I'm kind of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650 
went over so as you see here I'm kind of
hard<00:02:46.830> angle<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.550> could<00:02:47.910> turn<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> inside

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
hard angle to see could turn it inside

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.850 
hard angle to see could turn it inside
here<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.410> better<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:51.860> that's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
here you can see it better and that's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.220 
here you can see it better and that's
the<00:02:53.070> blade<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.760> did<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.209> simply<00:02:54.660> had

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the blade and all I did as I simply had

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.580 
the blade and all I did as I simply had
the<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.790> drill<00:02:57.390> mark<00:02:57.690> here<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.380> ran

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the the drill mark here and I just ran

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.030 
the the drill mark here and I just ran
it<00:02:58.770> down<00:02:58.950> here<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.730> turned<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.300> around<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
it down here and I turned it around and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.890 
it down here and I turned it around and
cut<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> other<00:03:02.190> side<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> was

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
cut the other side then and what I was

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.260 
cut the other side then and what I was
able<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.440> was<00:03:04.770> make<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.370> slot<00:03:05.730> longer

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
able to do was make that slot longer

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.720 
able to do was make that slot longer
without<00:03:06.510> having<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.020> lift<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> blade<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> you

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
without having to lift the blade is you

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.670 
without having to lift the blade is you
know<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.150> extend<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.020> now<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.470> works

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
know and extend it out so now it works

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.050 
know and extend it out so now it works
perfectly<00:03:11.070> let's<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.940> I'll

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
perfectly let's put it on there I'll

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.050 
perfectly let's put it on there I'll
show<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.870> what<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> end<00:03:13.320> result<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
show you what the end result is here the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.990 
show you what the end result is here the
old<00:03:15.209> one<00:03:15.570> which<00:03:16.350> works<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:17.519> but<00:03:17.850> not

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
old one which works really well but not

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.790 
old one which works really well but not

anything to fall down on that slot and
and<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.620> can<00:03:43.799> raise<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.310> or<00:03:44.430> lower<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.850> depending

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
and I can raise it or lower it depending

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.130 
and I can raise it or lower it depending
on<00:03:45.860> face<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:48.120> see<00:03:48.299> how<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:49.580> how<00:03:50.580> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
on face up you can see how the how the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.410 
on face up you can see how the how the
riving<00:03:52.140> knife<00:03:52.170> goes<00:03:52.560> along<00:03:52.860> with<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.519> I

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
riving knife goes along with that and I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.880 
riving knife goes along with that and I
think<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:54.959> perfect<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.320> looks<00:03:55.350> really<00:03:55.709> well

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
think it's perfect it looks really well

think it's perfect it looks really well
