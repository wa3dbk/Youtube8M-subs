00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 in this workshop we will learn how to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 make fresh pasta list 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 of ingredients for a serving is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 100 g of fine semolina an egg half a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.250
 tablespoon of olive oil a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.030
 half teaspoon white vinegar 2 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.980
 5 g of salt and allow about 50 g of 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.370
 flour a little lukewarm water for putting 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.710
 on point 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.860
 the total cost of ingredients proportion 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.020
 is 59 cents to start you 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.780
 pour the fine semolina of a container 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 then you will add the egg the oil 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 vinegar and salt then you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 knead together manually or 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.229
 the machine to get a firm dough 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.229
 and flexible at a time 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.970
 if your part 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.799
 wet you add some fine if she 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.369
 is too dry you add a little 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:35.530
 little warm water and you knead it 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.390
 at least a minute you can 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.369
 colored to the paws using by 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.950
 example of the inked cuttlefish of the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.229
 beetroot and pinard coloring spices 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.939
 food or even herbs 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.009
 aromatic like basil 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.270
 we will first start with 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.360
 install the hardware 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.340
 we need a rolling mill we 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.149
 stall our leg slightly 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.009
 we will cut it into small pieces 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.229
 and then you go to lower your dough 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.520
 with the smallest digit of your 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.459
 rolling mill on this one 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.130
 it's the number one you spend your 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.670
 dough in the rolling mill and you got it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.860
 recovered from above once 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.130
 you have to lower your dough you the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.519
 fold in half then where art went to 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.519
 rolling mill 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.360
 by a regular paw you can in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.360
 curve and slightly the edges 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.530
 if you find that your dough and very 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.420
 wet 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.000
 you can add a little bit of 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.430
 flour you performed the last 85 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.430
 passages without folding your dough 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 we will now be able to reduce 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.890
 the thickness of our paw by increasing 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.870
 the number of our rolling mill one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.870
 passage is enough on each thickness 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.060
 I advise you to recover the dough 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.170
 as and to avoid 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.170
 it does not stick 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.700
 to prevent your dough from sticking 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.130
 in the drying you can add 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.630
 the flour on this one we get 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.060
 strips that can be used for 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.790
 lasagna the cannelloni where the ravioli 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.130
 we notice that our paw has whitened 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.560
 it is the development of gluten that 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.950
 will give the pasta holding during the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.420
 baking 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.080
 we will see how to perform 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.160
 tagliatelle for spain and he the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.010
 principle is the same just 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.230
 to use the second of the cutters on 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.350
 our rolling mill we are preparing our 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.540
 dryer if you do not have a choice 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.490
 you can use a dish towel on 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.220
 which you will deposit and your dough 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.860
 you take your boss you the 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.140
 present in your rolling mill if 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:15.400
 possible in the middle and you just cut 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:19.590
 our dough then using a spatula 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.590
 you come to recover the plates 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.380
 if your pasta is dry 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.910
 the cut is perfect otherwise it can be 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.540
 some pasta is stuck between 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.130
 they are that your base dough was 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:53.170
 a little bit too wet or while 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:55.900
 your rolling mill is badly adjusted 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.910
 be careful that when drying your 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.130
 legs do not overlap to avoid 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.540
 that it does not stick together if you 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.200
 have a bank that is a little bit 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.200
 too long 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.180
 you can of course cut it in half 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.400
 for cooking you just need to 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.680
 dive your pasta 3 4 minutes into 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.000
 salted boiling water 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.490
 we can see that all our 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.050
 pasta are on the surface this is the site 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.890
 they are now cooked 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.050
 we are going to drain them now that 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.090
 our pasta are and taste you add the 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.900
 sauce you want and you stay 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.820
 more than to taste 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.830
 I wish you a very good appetite and 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.830
 see you soon on flavor seeds
