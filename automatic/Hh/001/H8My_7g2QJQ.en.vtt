00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.180
 over these 20 years what we have 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.000
 seen is that the most common activity that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 has the popocatépetl is generating 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 magmatic material that is housed inside 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.420
 from the crater 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 that we can not easily see the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.790
 inside of unless we're 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 flying over and these lava domes 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 form a plug it cools it gasifies the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.260
 stopper is as if it were the stopper 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 cork from a bottle of champagne 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 eventually the activity of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 the gas emission and finally it takes out 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 flying this dome through a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.670
 explosion tears it apart and there you are 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.510
 important fumaroles that we observed from 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.510
 ash 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.920
 the activity allowed us to see that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.860
 depending on the size of the volume that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.250
 form is the type of activity that is going 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.160
 to generate to destroy in this case the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.890
 butler is formed in December of the year 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.300
 2000 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.750
 and it's January 21, January 22, 2001 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.390
 how much this dome breaks and generates a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.040
 large column of ash goes down to another 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 phenomenon known as flows 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.690
 pyroclastics in one of the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.610
 canyons and this has been the most 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.430
 important that has happened in these 20 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.580
 years that allows us then to use it 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.580
 as a parameter or as the series of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.440
 parameters to which we can see that the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.300
 volcano is directed and as long as it does not pass 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.550
 that activity that was presented in 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.310
 December 2000 we will know 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:06.320
 so what is the most 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:08.570
 important that it happens sometimes the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.980
 popocatépetl can have 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.470
 giant catastrophic eruptions of 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.959
 made the current popocatépetl actually 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.269
 is built on the remains of three 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.030
 oldest volcanoes 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.069
 the volcano flare cassel volcanoes palantla 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.430
 4 sorry 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.829
 the maca de españa.la ventorrillo and the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.349
 volcano the friar and on top of the remains 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.870
 of those four previous volcanoes is 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.299
 current built the current popocatépetl 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.519
 those four previous volcanoes are 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.459
 destroyed in eruptions very much 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.290
 great for us to give us an idea 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.049
 of those eruptions that destroyed the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.200
 ventorrillo volcano 23 thousand years ago the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.889
 deposits reach the river rafts to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.209
 more than 100 kilometers away for 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:01.879
 effects of direct affectation 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.669
 we consider a radius of 100 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.189
 kilometers around the volcano inside 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.909
 of that radius in case of a rash 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.889
 greater there is the possibility that 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.169
 will deposit important amounts of 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.020
 ash for important amounts I want 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.030
 tell 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.040
 a few kilometers from the volcano it 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.980
 can deposit up to meters thick 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.440
 100 km, we would be talking about 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.000
 layers of a few millimeters or some 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.790
 centimeters but enough to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 affect daily life and so on
