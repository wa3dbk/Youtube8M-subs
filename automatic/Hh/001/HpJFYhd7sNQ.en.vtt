00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
gonna see at the moment alright so let's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.900 
gonna see at the moment alright so let's
go<00:03:03.080> up<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.200> middle<00:03:04.100> on<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:06.640> it's<00:03:07.640> got<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> nice

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
go up one middle on this it's got a nice

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.660 
go up one middle on this it's got a nice
microphone<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.459> wait<00:03:11.320> no<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.500> not<00:03:12.650> yes<00:03:13.010> so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
microphone and wait no it's not yes so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.380 
microphone and wait no it's not yes so
flexible<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:15.400> are<00:03:16.400> those<00:03:16.790> these<00:03:17.030> all<00:03:17.270> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
flexible what are those these all the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.690 
flexible what are those these all the
time<00:03:17.450> lamps<00:03:18.080> we<00:03:18.230> could<00:03:18.380> actually<00:03:18.530> just<00:03:18.709> reform

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
time lamps we could actually just reform

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.110 
time lamps we could actually just reform
that<00:03:19.880> true<00:03:20.150> metal<00:03:20.780> part<00:03:21.020> no<00:03:21.770> stick<00:03:22.130> but<00:03:23.030> it's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
that true metal part no stick but it's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030 
that true metal part no stick but it's
not<00:03:23.270> like<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.600> or<00:03:23.810> by<00:03:23.989> like<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> nice<00:03:24.590> camel

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
not like that or by like the nice camel

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.670 
not like that or by like the nice camel
design<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:26.420> think<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.410> get<00:03:27.560> replacement

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
design I think you can get replacement

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.490 
design I think you can get replacement
but<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.970> shouldn't<00:03:29.270> be<00:03:29.300> that<00:03:29.480> expensive<00:03:29.660> and

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
but it shouldn't be that expensive and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.560 
but it shouldn't be that expensive and
right<00:03:30.830> there's<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.250> LED<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.209> then<00:03:32.330> we<00:03:32.420> just

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
right there's the LED and then we just

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.199 
right there's the LED and then we just
try<00:03:32.840> turning<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.260> yeah<00:03:33.800> right<00:03:34.130> there<00:03:34.400> there's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
try turning on yeah right there there's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.729 
try turning on yeah right there there's
the<00:03:35.330> LED<00:03:35.720> no<00:03:36.470> place

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
the LED no place

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.500 
the LED no place
there's<00:03:39.739> some<00:03:39.860> volume<00:03:40.100> up/down<00:03:40.510> connector

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
there's some volume up/down connector

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.160 
there's some volume up/down connector
turning<00:03:41.989> off<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.350> off<00:03:42.500> off<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.550> on<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.390> oh

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
that's a bias got a nice rubber feeling

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.130 
that's a bias got a nice rubber feeling
