00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and so that way which is good but then

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
and so that way which is good but then
usually<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.460> Matthew<00:01:08.820> Mark<00:01:09.030> Luke<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and then we'll go to to maybe acts and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
and then we'll go to to maybe acts and
then<00:01:16.049> we'll<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> something<00:01:16.770> else<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.340> then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
then we'll go to something else and then

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
then we'll go to something else and then
we'll<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> Old<00:01:18.000> Testament<00:01:18.450> Genesis<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we just keep going back and forth and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.050 
we just keep going back and forth and
back<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:20.939> forth<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:23.369> doing<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
back and forth and I think by doing that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740 
back and forth and I think by doing that
a<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.290> people<00:01:25.790> miss<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.150> big<00:01:27.330> picture<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a lot of people miss the big picture of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.550 
a lot of people miss the big picture of
the<00:01:27.900> Bible<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.700> also<00:01:29.880> tends<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.170> people

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the Bible and it also tends for people

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.510 
the Bible and it also tends for people
to<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:32.009> things<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> context<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.520> maybe

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to take things out of context so maybe

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
to take things out of context so maybe
if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.829> gonna

integrated<00:03:52.070> into<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.519> book<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.790> Genesis<00:03:53.350> and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
I think by reading the Bible in a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.789 
I think by reading the Bible in a
chronological<00:03:56.330> order<00:03:56.840> we'll<00:03:57.380> be<00:03:57.500> able<00:03:57.620> to
