00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
I felt comfortable enough that I I just

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.870 
I felt comfortable enough that I I just
hit<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> step-up<00:00:58.829> bubble<00:00:59.190> straightaway<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
hit the step-up bubble straightaway and

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.300 
hit the step-up bubble straightaway and
I<00:01:00.360> played<00:01:01.140> around<00:01:01.260> done<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.560> few<00:01:01.739> laps<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.160> got

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
I played around done a few laps and got

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.430 
I played around done a few laps and got
a<00:01:02.340> feel<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.300> klx<00:01:03.810> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.320> very

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
a feel for the the klx and I was very

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.650 
a feel for the the klx and I was very
surprised<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.119> turned<00:01:06.390> really

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
surprised is a it actually turned really

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.900 
surprised is a it actually turned really
well<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:08.250> maybe<00:01:08.399> because<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.850> was

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
well I think maybe because it was

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.660 
well I think maybe because it was
lowering<00:01:09.390> suspension<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> bit

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
lowering suspension was you know a bit

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
lowering suspension was you know a bit
softer<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.210> motocross<00:01:12.540> bike<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> set<00:01:13.830> up

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
softer than a motocross bike and set up

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.450 
softer than a motocross bike and set up
for<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.820> bush<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.390> yeah<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
for the bush and yeah so just very

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.790 
for the bush and yeah so just very
surprising<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.509> turned<00:01:18.540> then

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
surprising how well it turned then

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.440 
surprising how well it turned then
I<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.340> confident<00:01:20.670> enough<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.910> hit<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I was confident enough to hit all the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
I was confident enough to hit all the
big<00:01:21.570> jumps<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.160> really<00:01:23.190> good<00:01:23.520> package

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
big jumps on it's a really good package

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
big jumps on it's a really good package
because<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.480> know<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.170> power<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.620> very

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because it you know the power is very

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.150 
because it you know the power is very
smooth<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.880> broad<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
smooth and broad and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.260 
smooth and broad and
that's<00:01:29.160> what<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> guys<00:01:29.760> for<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.120> bush

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's what all the guys for the bush

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530 
that's what all the guys for the bush
are<00:01:30.450> looking<00:01:30.660> for<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.760> suspension<00:01:32.760> would<00:01:33.150> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
are looking for and suspension would be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.110 
are looking for and suspension would be
spot-on<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.200> hit<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> trails<00:01:34.620> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.120> you

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
spot-on to hit the trails I think you

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.730 
spot-on to hit the trails I think you
know<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.600> made<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.260> motocross<00:01:37.590> track

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
know it's not made to a motocross track

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
know it's not made to a motocross track
but<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.550> got<00:01:39.119> around<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.450> motocross<00:01:39.690> track<00:01:39.780> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
but I got around the motocross track on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.930
