00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:11.150
 Yes Well Thank you this time will send you the bisector of the interior angle of a triangle of high school mathematics number City 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.910
 To do 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.540
 In the last time I did the radius of the circumscribed circle after the inscribed circle , but this second grade as a keyword this time 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.510
 Division line 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:27.470
 You're a problem, please try doing to stop the all means racer child because only one question videos 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.599
 A little harsh Do Tteyuu child I ask them to check in is doing commentary of the cat in question from now 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.599
 I 'm going, so I hope you 'll listen 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.170
 Because it's good, I'm going to go to the floor of this problem. 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.890
 To do 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.300
 Let's go Yoshi Well then First I issue the confirmation certificate 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.479
 It'd Well angle and length so that the triangle of course pick is out 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:58.010
 The angle is 60 degrees ab a 4 ac umbrella 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:59.160
 When it comes to witch beer, there are three information and people, and that triangle abc's horny bisector is a side 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.960
 Cross with bc 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.940
 Let's find a 1000-part sales umbrella with point t 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.870
 This is please try to write to the figures myself because only a little tough to imagine in a sentence 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.230
 It Nde I a simple illustration 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.510
 In the up or try to write a triangle so as to satisfy the triangle once this is adab is a 4 ac 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 It's a long time is more of the left because it's 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.320
 Because 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.170
 Oh dear 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 It is bad if I say appropriate 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.050
 It's roughly like this, Yale station 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.470
 here in the b disciple is here is Mr. ac is san What is 4 ab gold 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.920
 Of which have become here 60 degrees 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.320
 The bisector of the horn 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.729
 This 30 degrees pastry 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.480
 The bisector and bc in and was here 30 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.970
 Because this improvement is d 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.220
 Here it has become a d 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.470
 As the NEP is that want to find the length Nde length of crackers one like this 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.350
 It is a pattern 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.860
 Because in First Well for want required to keep writing good ad Why Yeah yeah annoying 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.500
 Good child Rex and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.720
 I I I Ne here x will get Oite 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.049
 So there are two ways to divide this into two, so this time, I used a trace so easily 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.819
 I will go online 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:29.790
 In I'm writing this I first area of the relationship and say how to do 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.790
 Large triangle in Thats write Okki's 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.540
 You can see this by abc and this area is the sum of the triangle on the left and the triangle on the right 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.380
 Or Thats 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 So I will write it first The triangle abc 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.650
 Triangle abd left side 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.709
 Perth 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.490
 Triangle ac technology is right 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.310
 You've got a body 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:04.150
 And say or do not come at the only issue Meiji of one the number of triangles and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.900
 The formula for ps 3 is already done, so I will use it 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:14.080
 At first it is big sense system, but this 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:19.319
 Because it is understood that 4 is understood and love is understood even if it is a lock angle 60, it takes 60 when 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:28.090
 First of all, the triangle abc is 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:28.900
 I can win 1/2 4 take a walk 4 and 3 in San'in 60 degrees so a little locksmith key sin 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.110
 60 ° 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.610
 It is the route of the minute 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.440
 This is clear on the left-hand side triangle a 4 triangle abc 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.790
 In ward that I think a little I wonder what use this is it's only the official in a little before 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.560
 As we take up in the official of Heron or in front of it, please confirm slightly 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.610
 This doesn't decrease, though 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.850
 De = Mr. 9 ab 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:01.210
 The triangle on the left side should use 4 and x and 30 degrees 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:07.070
 Since 4 such it because it is a sign of between x and 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:09.830
 Sanin 30 degrees in only x multiplying 1/2 multiplied by 4 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.440
 That is 1/2 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.620
 Neko is triangular abd 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.240
 Tars triangle acd also 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:27.270
 Mr. x and 30 degrees Chikai since put out 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:33.720
 1/2 か け る x x サ イ ン Sign at 30 degrees 1⁄2 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.390
 I will organize this in the left side first of all because it can be translated in Building 2 Building 4 Sun route 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.840
 It is 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.840
 I'm roundabout but I'll cut it here + I'll start by the side 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.920
 Dare in I'm going to be in the x and this about a minute 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:53.420
 It is the other party 4/4 Please write in x 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:57.689
 Tteyuu door number or why I'm finally Bouchon Iine corner N marker 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:01.979
 It becomes 3/4 x Nde can not be about a minute in here 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:05.699
 I have to get it back in 4 minutes in 2 minutes I want to fix x2 anyway 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.860
 Well then it will be 7/4 x and reorganized up 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:15.770
 Until it is slightly replaced Let 's take a 7/4 x left 3 minutes left Sunroute 's right 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.260
 Because it is not necessary to change a millionaire if it is completely replaced 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.470
 7/4 Exe = 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.960
 It will be 3 Rood 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:30.190
 Dechotto bets Nde name likely if Kurere over both sides it 4/7 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.289
 x = 7 minutes 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:38.740
 12 route Mishima 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.740
 Because this is ad x = this is the answer 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:49.650
 Nephew I want asked the x when made in the match against Togo in that Well in such a feeling from in 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:52.040
 Large area using the say I is determined by adding the area of the two triangles ask them 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.340
 Please give me 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.330
 I guess is this time the other to do the way I'm kinda not Remarks 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.140
 There is something that I want you to remember as knowledge 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.140
 In triangle 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.889
 I'm using the corner bisect line this time 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.860
 This time 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.860
 It's knowledge that can be used other than this problem 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:24.780
 There is such a triangle 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:30.840
 Now if I'm halving this here I will use two clothes if I read it now 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:34.689
 Quit this I hate Thats is the length of the house and here is 4 and Mr. probably the bisector 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:41.589
 It takes 4 years and 3 years 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:43.610
 It's the day of the place where I'm split and I'm listening to it here 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:48.380
 As it is 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:53.689
 In other words, 4 vs. 3 if the roof is 4 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:58.240
 I often make mistakes 4 or 3 or 4 vs. 3 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:02.710
 Who is five centimeters and do a post-tiny you were 2 centimeters because 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:08.020
 And can by cut by digital was much the location of the relationship'm also do some words and used it 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:13.969
 So please remember by all means as knowledge will come out when it is used other than this problem 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:19.659
 When halving into triangles, the length of the roof will affect the floor below 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:19.659
 No , it's not a bonus, but I would appreciate your favor 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:31.110
 In this time we have sent you bisector of the interior angle of the high school mathematics number City of triangle 

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:36.810
 Thank you very much for seeing me this time 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.860
 So it's the next time, but it's a plane like saying it's a triangle or a rectangle inscribed in a circle so far 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.790
 I've been doing with 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.040
 The next time is easy with plane flat 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:50.279
 Cut will go to space figure first is a tetrahedron tetrahedron four schools eyes 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:56.300
 I will take up the problem, but if you like, please take a look at those people 

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:56.300
 Well then this time it is over here and over Thank you very much---
