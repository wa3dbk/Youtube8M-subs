garrison back in the day there was

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.240 
garrison back in the day there was
actually<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.059> huge<00:01:02.450> whaling<00:01:02.870> station<00:01:03.320> here<00:01:03.559> but

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
actually a huge whaling station here but

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.819 
actually a huge whaling station here but
other<00:01:04.549> than<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.969> we've<00:01:05.869> got<00:01:05.899> wildlife<00:01:06.560> and

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
other than that we've got wildlife and

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.260 
other than that we've got wildlife and
we've<00:01:06.979> got<00:01:07.159> penguins<00:01:07.610> here<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.090> can<00:01:08.119> see

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
we've got penguins here as you can see

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.219 
we've got penguins here as you can see
so<00:01:10.119> this<00:01:11.119> is<00:01:11.299> not<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.509> place<00:01:11.869> that's

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
so this is not a place that's

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.520 
so this is not a place that's
particularly<00:01:13.159> hospitable<00:01:13.929> little<00:01:14.929> to<00:01:15.079> people

particularly hospitable little to people

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.679 
particularly hospitable little to people
but<00:01:16.189> penguins<00:01:16.729> love<00:01:16.880> it

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
but penguins love it

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.160 
but penguins love it
