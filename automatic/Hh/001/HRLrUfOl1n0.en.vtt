00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 you understand by the name of the video review on the mod 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.179
 snow for gta san andreas what to do 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.010
 challenge we already understood the whole point 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.320
 it replaces the textures of standard hts 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 Andreas on the texture of snow that is, we 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 get winter in gta sanandres 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.910
 whatever california was there sunny 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.010
 winter state has come we have winter we need 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 in the game for more for more ambiance 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 All the more so soon the new year and this still 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.789
 more since but the magnetosphere is obtained and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 so here to work with glue for work 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.140
 this mod needs cleo 4 versions there 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.930
 one script that adds to the game 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.210
 more snowy atmosphere now 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 we see a mod as if standard 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 set all stupid to replace the texture but 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
 when you click the contour + + + + 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.890
 but no matter how absurd it may sound 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.399
 the plus sign is not an extra keyboard then 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.360
 num + thing includes us here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 act 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 i.e. snowfall fashion by snowfall skill 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.079
 supposedly because I myself have changed the weather 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 let's we sit down a typewriter all show 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.430
 that's when we ride so much attention 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.580
 business game we ride our camera she 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.740
 You see as it were, with snow 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.390
 there are such frozen here 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 textures but we're at speeds on 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.990
 same rate growths drive here because 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.290
 them 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.799
 in us just the camera falls forward 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 snowball 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.580
 we go we go we go to distant lands not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.899
 turn over but there really are such here 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 affairs 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.930
 let's just go and see how 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.700
 because that bite I don't know why not 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.039
 When shooting, the texture was not usually laid 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.429
 what are you doing? 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.229
 register here you see the snow river on the river 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 Belle my such that the type is ice and all 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.429
 snow can be done again like this 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.799
 and we will get this 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.179
 already snow 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.260
 and now the snow is looking even more 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.090
 intensely and now he went on 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.090
