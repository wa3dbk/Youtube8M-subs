00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi, people here, the band guarantees 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.029
 Today's video is a review that I was 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 being due on 10 th the bodies of the mother tish 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.590
 Walter, I was delighted with the books. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.769
 I do not know if I can do 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.210
 a decent review is all the difficulty 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.080
 to talk about books I liked 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.060
 damn it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.720
 then everything seems like it does not reach the feet 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 and I get confused when it comes to talking and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 I really hope you quit this video. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 be enlightening and as good as I can 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.039
 say something to something 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 the book will tell the story of blue in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 third person then we do not have 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.430
 that problem of building in the mind of the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.200
 protagonist and bother with the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 thoughts of her since she 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.910
 she is 16 years old and does not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 fool me in high school and everything and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.899
 People do not have this problem of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.420
 boring thoughts of protagonist is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.039
 narrated in the third person and has the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.100
 of different cores 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.230
 the protagonist is the globe and she comes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.820
 from a family of evident her mother 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.980
 evident and lives with a few more 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 women living alone and she has not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.420
 power no 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 in fact her only power is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 amplify the powers of the mother of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.170
 other beings that have some power 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 well then on a certain date do not 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.119
 deceit on the eve of saint day 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 that no one celebrates or anything else 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.700
 blue has a mission she goes with her mother 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 from her to a church to see the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.490
 the roe of all who will die in that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.829
 year her mother notes souls to the student 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.909
 can see nothing that sees the spirits is 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.920
 her mother but she goes there to help 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.930
 to amplify the mother's powers and she has 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 every year that did it there only in the year 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 that such a story takes place in the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.159
 book she does not go with her mother goes with 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.770
 levels which is a psychic who just 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.270
 to arrive in the city at the invitation of the mother 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.979
 it if I'm not mistaken it is already a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 of her mother then treated 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.490
 mission level goes with her to note the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.340
 names of those who died only in that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.290
 I had particular bluff for the first time 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.880
 a soul can see one of the souls that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.979
 are passing by and she can 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
 talking to this soul even asks the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.719
 name and everything else, friend explains that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.970
 The only motive ready seen that soul is 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.610
 because it is true love or because 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.890
 that she killed and blue always 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.320
 grew with a kind of prophecy one 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.110
 the vision she had is that her mother had 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.210
 other accident had that when the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.130
 balloon kiss your true love him 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.760
 is going to die so I do not see anyone until 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.140
 today and she will stay with this thing 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.020
 School is going to leave, something will talk. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.630
 tomorrow she did not see anyone is a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.790
 Funny, this father, she sees 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830
 our passage from the dead for the first time. 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.900
 Once a soul recognizes you can speak 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.990
 with the saÃºva to discover the name that ganser 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.940
 the other core of the book exists 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.670
 oscar other bodies that are the boys 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.820
 who study in one of the most 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.920
 where the symbol is a body and 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.230
 so the boys are called bodies 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.830
 and the special group of friends 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.010
 they have the main face of this group 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.860
 they will say that it is the mandachuva tea 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 neighbor of the group is called gum if 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.290
 He is super curious about a certain 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.660
 the legend he learned from some 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.720
 reason in his past so he is super 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.360
 curious with this legend he was 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.760
 for me and to research about it and the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.560
 friends of his kind that help him then 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.019
 sound flu with a group of friends 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.480
 four people and counting on each 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.060
 one has its mysteries in every boy 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.269
 Has a family or family background? 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 very good gift with family that 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.739
 have problems so everyone has their own 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.890
 problem there in this nucleus 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.630
 obviously the globe will end if 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.790
 crossing them because they will want to 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.070
 look for a psychic and they will remember 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 of the donkey remember him and will have this is 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.970
 in our history in the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.720
 It worries that this happens well in the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.280
 start and do not know the meg ameg she creates 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.380
 things so it does not seem to have any 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.840
 It feels like it will not go 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.420
 Allow none but it 's so cool, I do not 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.930
 I know why telling this story seems 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.780
 a boring thing then what is she 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.150
 counting and the characters she created 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.970
 the story is so different from the story 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.190
 has a title for selection and is heavy 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.500
 even kaka happens one thing but so 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.870
 she created the characters so fun 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.340
 and with the so-called tirades that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.190
 it is not to determine 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.220
 the moments of the book that is have one each 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.380
 emotional load has one more thing 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.810
 dark but still the book is very 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.710
 fun and full of lots of takes 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.250
 cool 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.250
 I loved all the characters in the goose. 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.800
 sweetheart and the family of good people to 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.800
 house sign wool is very funny 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.669
 because every every woman who lives there 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.380
 they do not have their different personality 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.169
 I do not know, one does not like being sent. 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.840
 do nothing and another is on the street has a 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.310
 different personality so they are 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.200
 very creative when they are 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.889
 may be passing there inside that 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.900
 House 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.020
 each one plays an answer if no one is 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.840
 stabs in the ports so it is very 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.919
 Bad grace when I said I wanted it. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.510
 talk of the books I wanted to read reread 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:22.320
 so I finished the law was because 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.960
 the book so it brings a legend a 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.490
 very complex methodology 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.340
 It's a story so you need to 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.740
 explanation and since the beginning of the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.450
 she gives these explanations only 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.130
 that you will only understand the meaning that 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.840
 it all has a sense when it arrives 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.760
 there at the end of the book then gives this 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.830
 want to reread the book because 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.229
 So what will happen in the end, I'm going 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.289
 taking all this information and 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.550
 putting everything together to close at the end 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.780
 was in order to review this book for 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.789
 get this information that I do not 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.160
 I picked up at the beginning what I let pass 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.690
 What I did not care about was the 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.030
 information was therefore my feeling 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.490
 besides the state is very good and the search for 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.680
 more and those who disagree on more 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.669
 cool and the story ends 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.240
 conflict in degrees indicated that the jury will 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:14.940
 leave in this state now it releases it 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:17.099
 and you will see only so I do not recommend 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.229
 reading the last page you have 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.300
 willpower laws if you have 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.010
 this mania of reading the last page I do not 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.360
 I recommend that you do this good book does 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.580
 part of a series 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.370
 so I 've been researching if 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.039
 you will be wrong is that four books 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.990
 here is more by the near blue vision 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.729
 I think it will have the most rumbling vision 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.680
 maybe next is the goal 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.870
 I think it's going to be like this, I do not have it 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.729
 sure correct me if I'm wrong 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.430
 we that much information about it and 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.960
 little ashti the next as putting 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.289
 like crazy about the next 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.039
 even more because the next is is about the 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:57.839
 super mysterious character and then the 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:00.449
 that book ends with a 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.460
 passing through it is a problem that 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.129
 he had in history and he's going to 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.610
 begin to explain then they were very 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:11.279
 very very close and people lion is very 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.289
 good and if you read schiffer on calafh I 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:16.289
 did not like it because it was very mellow day 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:19.069
 She knows I really liked it. 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:23.099
 chills only that I was agonized with 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.659
 18 mellow and the average one fixes us a lot on 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:28.080
 mythology that bothered me a lot 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:30.029
 shaken there in this one I do not know that she 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.430
 gives privilege to mythology for the 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:34.740
 history and for a strong friendship of 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.740
 characters and does not set too much romance 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.439
 despite having this student power thing 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.139
 Kissing your real girl no longer receives 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:45.209
 certain then there is something has not 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.969
 the same time knows is not time consuming and 

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:51.300
 fun is FACCAT chico has taken 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:53.789
