00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:21.440 
good use a little bit of a ascending
wiper<00:03:13.610> to

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.270 

yeah<00:03:22.200> that's<00:03:22.680> good<00:03:22.950> right<00:03:23.190> there<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:29.130> what

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
yeah that's good right there and what

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.800 
yeah that's good right there and what
I'm<00:03:29.340> doing<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.730> here<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.000> adding<00:03:30.450> little

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
I'm doing right here is adding little

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.220 
I'm doing right here is adding little
dabs<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.390> that's<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.990> tip

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
dabs on on the one that's on the tip

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.670 
dabs on on the one that's on the tip
maybe<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.860> blue<00:03:35.130> pen<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> answer<00:03:36.410> not<00:03:37.410> too

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
maybe a blue pen is the answer not too

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
to test control yeah you can put as much

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.440 
to test control yeah you can put as much
as<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.290> want<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:43.770> there<00:03:44.040> once<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> feel
