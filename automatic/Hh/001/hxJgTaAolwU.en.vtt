car<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.809> Oh<00:00:37.200> 20<00:00:38.040> years<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.570> rebuilt<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> engine

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
car for Oh 20 years I rebuilt the engine

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
car for Oh 20 years I rebuilt the engine
back<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.520> 2003<00:00:41.809> when<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.840> had<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.789> 120,000

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
back in 2003 when it had about 120,000

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.920 
back in 2003 when it had about 120,000
miles<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.629> hundred<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
miles on it it's got two hundred and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.440 
miles on it it's got two hundred and
seventy<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.260> thousand<00:00:46.860> miles<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.219> now

seventy two thousand miles on it now
when<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> rebuilt<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> engine<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.520> did<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> couple

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
when I rebuilt the engine I did a couple

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
when I rebuilt the engine I did a couple
of<00:00:50.940> touches<00:00:51.530> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.710> own<00:00:52.860> special

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of touches kind of my own special

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.639 
of touches kind of my own special
touches<00:00:54.079> one<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.640> put<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> boost<00:00:56.910> gauge<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
touches one is I put a boost gauge in it

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
touches one is I put a boost gauge in it
right<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.969> zero<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> thirty<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
right there to zero to thirty the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.630 
right there to zero to thirty the
factory<00:01:01.859> boost<00:01:02.070> gauge<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
factory boost gauge is right there and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
factory boost gauge is right there and
has<00:01:05.640> no<00:01:05.850> number<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.630> can't<00:01:06.840> tell<00:01:07.080> what

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
has no number so you can't tell what

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.490 
has no number so you can't tell what
boosted<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.930> couple<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.110> things<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
boosted got a couple other things that I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
boosted got a couple other things that I
did<00:01:11.030> was<00:01:12.560> when<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> rebuilt<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> engine<00:01:14.180> let's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
did was when I rebuilt the engine let's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.930 
did was when I rebuilt the engine let's
open<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> hood<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.869> here

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.930 

I<00:01:20.140> put<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.230> total<00:01:21.590> seal<00:01:21.770> gapless<00:01:22.250> piston<00:01:22.730> rings

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
I put in total seal gapless piston rings

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.060 
I put in total seal gapless piston rings
they're<00:01:23.870> great<00:01:24.200> for<00:01:24.440> no<00:01:24.620> blow<00:01:24.830> by<00:01:27.070> balanced

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
they're great for no blow by balanced

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.020 
they're great for no blow by balanced
and<00:01:28.190> blueprinted<00:01:28.280> everything<00:01:30.460> new<00:01:31.460> turbo

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and blueprinted everything new turbo

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.390 
and blueprinted everything new turbo
coupling<00:01:32.540> hoses<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.710> course<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.100> got<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
coupling hoses of course it's got the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.860 
coupling hoses of course it's got the
front<00:01:34.520> mount<00:01:34.790> intercooler<00:01:35.030> which<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.720> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
front mount intercooler which is the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.870 
front mount intercooler which is the
whole<00:01:36.230> front<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.800> car<00:01:37.010> it's<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.550> great

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
whole front of the car it's a great

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.140 
whole front of the car it's a great
intercooler<00:01:39.160> more<00:01:40.160> turbo<00:01:40.550> coupling

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.360 

couplings<00:01:44.150> there<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.630> removed<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.650> boost

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
couplings there I removed the boost

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.310 
couplings there I removed the boost
restrictor<00:01:46.910> these<00:01:47.270> cars<00:01:47.570> are<00:01:47.780> limited<00:01:48.140> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
restrictor these cars are limited to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.280 
restrictor these cars are limited to
nine<00:01:48.650> pounds<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.220> boost<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.870> put<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.200> a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
nine pounds of boost so I put in a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.120 
nine pounds of boost so I put in a
manual<00:01:51.620> boost<00:01:51.830> controller<00:01:52.190> right<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.120> and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
manual boost controller right here and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.580 
manual boost controller right here and
the<00:01:55.130> boost<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:55.670> 12<00:01:56.000> pounds<00:01:56.360> it'll<00:01:56.780> put<00:01:57.410> out

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the boost is now 12 pounds it'll put out

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.050 
the boost is now 12 pounds it'll put out
about<00:01:58.300> 16<00:01:59.300> or<00:01:59.480> 17<00:01:59.510> and<00:02:00.460> really<00:02:01.460> fry<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.760> tires

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
about 16 or 17 and really fry the tires

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.300 
about 16 or 17 and really fry the tires
but<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:04.370> keep<00:02:04.520> mom<00:02:04.700> safe<00:02:06.100> we're<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.250> to

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
but to keep mom safe we're going to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.080 
but to keep mom safe we're going to
limit<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.640> boost<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.550> now<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.850> got<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
limit that boost so now that you got the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.960 
limit that boost so now that you got the
chance<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.540> see<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:11.960> old<00:02:12.110> beauty<00:02:12.820> how<00:02:13.820> about
