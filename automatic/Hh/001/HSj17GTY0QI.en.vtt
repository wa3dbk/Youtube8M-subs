00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.920
 go back on the plateau of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 Africa Cup of Nations on Canal + 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.290
 sport at half time the ghana leads so 1 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.170
 goal to 0 against Senegal first big 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 this monday's poster which will be followed by 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.590
 algeria south africa it will be 20 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 hours kick off 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 7:50 pm for the pre-game just after 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 league specialist 1 we will come back on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.920
 this first period between ghana and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 senegal nasser we will see again this moment 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 which is rocking for the moment this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.530
 first period and this mistake you in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.480
 talked about the Senegalese goalkeeper 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 what is classic about ghana is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 to wait to wait for everyone to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 pass the counter that the in time 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 even at 3 especially in France it m 2 including 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.539
 the only striker makes the difference the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.800
 good goalkeeper angel on it right on 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.640
 early you had seen the penalty before 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 even he intervenes 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 yeah but semi classic so we 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.850
 should he be waiting because he has 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.039
 a closing but good in general what 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 are these little mistakes that make them 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.840
 do great damage behind the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.030
 captain camp nou lé so that allows the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 ghana to get this penalty turned the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 very zen andré ayew there it's easy 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.540
 it's very pro especially it's very little 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 but hey it's soothing take place because 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.320
 than matches like that that do not 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.979
 clothes when you make a mistake like 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.049
 that to make up for it will be very very 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.860
 difficult devil and we see him for himself 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.030
 put back in the game and to go 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.009
 look for this equalization 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.689
 it will be a backup could I not 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.549
 thought it was hard for senegal in 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.689
 this beginning of the match especially as the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 Senegalese have almost cashed a 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.009
 second goal quickly enough 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:43.010
 6 22nd even with this very good balloon given 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.680
 by jordan ayew 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.550
 what is safe radios ranking 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 classic car with three teams 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.130
 African 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.960
 if they do not need to be at 6.7 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.120
 an offensive overdue thoroughly the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.620
 difference that spaces have released to 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.900
 two three players there will be more do 2 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 0 and the match was bent what would it 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.800
 yes, yes, yes, that's it 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.390
 that's the mark of the very 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.160
 very big African team his 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.870
 abilities to stay easily out 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.210
 like that we count at any time and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.570
 go mark you worry 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.150
 severe silvert we also have opportunities 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.370
 d senegal because senegal has failed 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.990
 eventually reacted to alain's team 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.670
 shepherd who got two huge 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.830
 opportunities but in front there was a 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.660
 great guardian bremen first of all on 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:30.500
 this head to follow of a bogie that makes 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:34.810
 a superb stop he demonstrated there he is 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.640
 only it is lens he has the firm hand 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.830
 and then to acer we have failed 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.620
 attend the goal of this african cup 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.120
 nations for the moment they provide 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.170
 like that we do to return as 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.450
 it is that it has taken too much 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.570
 have to be introduced took if he 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.340
 had unscrewed a bit and that would have gone 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.720
 a little it finally radiates the player from 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.310
 stoke is beautiful and art is also 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.959
 beautiful and admitted that the customs has 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.370
 still do not see it and do not see 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.750
 the departure but he is there he is present 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.670
 he does what he needs he is very 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.920
 interesting to say of a balance I understand 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 that come a risk of 20 big 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.160
 contenders for the final gala coronation 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.330
 please you since the beginning of this 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.070
 eruption he sees a team very 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.510
 smart especially there who have 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.160
 a great experience 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.320
 we feel the succession of matches and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.519
 yet three essential players when 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.630
 previous campaigns we recall 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.620
 are not there they did the housework 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.260
 with boeing 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.400
 sulley muntari and michael essien who do not 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.730
 are not there it was the choice of avram 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.190
 grant 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.720
 the Ghana coach who took 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.640
 the team at the last moment almost 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.780
 to lead it during this cup 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.860
 from africa nations we talk about 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.890
 Algeria in a few moments 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.810
 sylvère you were talking about 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.019
 this meeting the issues the expectations 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.310
 at home because in Ghana and Senegal 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.989
 there is a kind of national cohesion 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.790
 to wait for this result is this 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.560
 meet well in Ghana we live with the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.700
 remember the four canes that were 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.860
 carried away the last to the world when 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.260
 even far enough in 1982 and since that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.750
 period there in Ghana well we wait until 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.170
 the country wins a cane and in addition to 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.610
 this could come 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.250
 never the ghana won this 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.660
 competition come to repair a trauma 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.730
 national since there is little time 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.190
 This was a few days ago in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.110
 station depot of burned drugs then 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.060
 I invite you to a drug guy 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.620
 these three times nothing except that it is a 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.209
 2010 calm years to fight against 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.430
 AIDS with equipment equipment 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.049
 medical devices that went up in smoke and the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.359
 prison the republic wins she said 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.100
 it's a real national tragedy 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.150
 so that's why a victory in 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800
 any case a good behavior of 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.050
 winners of the black stars would allow 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.160
 warm the hearts of Ghanaians and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.600

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.830

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.590
 that there is a catastrophe that has 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.419
 unfolded in a match that opposed 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.970
 pikine who is the champion in title 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.590

 won by guy of birds score 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.220
 3-0 and such an emotion that both 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.650
 teams decided to make a match of 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.330
 support to repay income from 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.979

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.960
 meeting was swept away by pikine on 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.400
