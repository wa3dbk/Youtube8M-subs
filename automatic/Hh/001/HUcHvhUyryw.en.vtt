00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.740
 everywhere beans are cooked sometimes 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.799
 good and bad 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.950
 talking about cooking you know what we're going to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.950
 do 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.990
 as you will see I have prepared a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.220
 grater and that is not to eat it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.220
 all assured that it is not 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.680
 tomato 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.219
 if I have seen you in other ministry is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
 much more worthy than peeling tomatoes and reading 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 you take before order cross hot water and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 we peel for the years and the neo crisis 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.770
 today are ricotta 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 let's put the salt ricotta and my 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 fault that is normally bought from 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 supermarket usually has too much serum 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.789
 then they know what to do 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 wrap it in a canvas two or three hours 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.489
 before wrapping it in absorbent paper and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.110
 let it rest so we can stay 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.180
 well dry how is that to grate 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.930
 we already advance a little pepper cheese 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.120
 of well-scented grinder do not put me 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 nervous scratching and I get very nervous 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.610
 you say 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 flour in a small proportion and we started to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.640
 take the dough does not take eggs does not take 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.330
 no aggregate but you know with what 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 we're going to perfume with basil and we're going 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.460
 to be of pesto basil with garlic and oil 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:46.560
 of olive a processed to perfume this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:49.770
 mass these ministries these are from 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 I see little by little how fast 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.920
 I need because the quality of the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.810
 ricota that I am using is the amount 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.159
 of flour I'm going to use the balls 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.479
 they rub fast little by little 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.239
 what good hand have I given the art of kneading 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.030
 from my grandmother really I from tiny 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.549
 I admired so much taking those masses where no 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.940
 There was not even one little friend in the counter and 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.250
 I learned that a good kneader 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.110
 it has to be with hands 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.610
 so clean and without too much excess of who 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.190
 He would have been the taste for eating 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.170
 because the only thing that one knew 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.930
 lean on another the only thing that gives 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.680
 was the mortal the jaw would ensure 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.110
 a grandmother a good cook mom if my 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.720
 mom prepared very well cakes desserts 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.879
 He could not expose the wires as 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.099
 let's see if we match well the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.239
 hands and look at this technique it's fine 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.660
 important the clean table 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.150
 cut a portion the dough is moist 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.609
 and in the clean counter I have to 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.269
 form my roll to later cut 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.269
 children 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.480
 we do the roll well 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.630
 the musical background of maracas that I am 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.630
 I 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.340
 in song says 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.250
 Now then much flour 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.580
 observing this is very important 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.050
 that's like you have to serve the dough 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.500
 so that afterwards it does not get stuck in 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.040
 principle not and then now if 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:41.930
 clean blade align the blade and if 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.550
 we do it like this from ezeiza tristÃ¡n fast 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 this faster than I do not 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.470
 it may be but we can supply t 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.610
 quickly with all this as for 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.660
 get home you put the pan 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.210
 and the sauce is going to be very fast that's why 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.430
 we are peeling tomatoes and then 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.430
 let's cut in cubes 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.750
 it was going to be a sauce absolutely 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.750
 natural for the second time I continue 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:20.049
 cutting the gnocchi and you know that enrique 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:22.210
 They are tender dissolve in the mouth 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.199
 you know wonderful that I was 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.660
 presented when he says the joke 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.460
 terrassa me the teeth of the cheese I 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.510
 I remembered a friend of mine poor saint who 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.030
 had the teeth is not the truth have 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.070
 inside the loose and you saw that sometimes 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.639
 at wakes people serve as 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.940

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.340

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.220
 it was and they served some to crumb knives 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.780
 At the wake we were at a wake and 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.430
 They served sandwiches crumb him 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.380
 I had a little hungry backward grabbed 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.110
 like four sandwiches together they 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.360
 it fit in my mouth and because I had bad 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.160
 Pegadito up here was like a 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.350
 kind of toothpaste you will 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.350
 they went down and the man in the 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.270
 half of the wake does not know what to do 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.000
