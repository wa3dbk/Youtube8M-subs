in 1 convertible so let's take a look at

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.840 
in 1 convertible so let's take a look at
how<00:00:20.520> hey<00:00:21.119> SUSE<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.689> acer<00:00:22.080> has<00:00:22.320> decided<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.100> do

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
how hey SUSE or acer has decided to do

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
how hey SUSE or acer has decided to do
this<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> flips<00:00:24.750> over<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.410> flips<00:00:26.039> down

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this so it flips over and flips down

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
this so it flips over and flips down
this<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.550> kind<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.660> saw<00:00:27.869> with

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this is kind of like what we saw with

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.420 
this is kind of like what we saw with
the<00:00:28.349> dell<00:00:29.390> yeah<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> dev<00:00:30.750> patel<00:00:31.019> duos<00:00:31.859> right

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the dell yeah the dev patel duos right

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.490 
the dell yeah the dev patel duos right
but<00:00:33.000> without<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> middle<00:00:33.840> frame<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> top

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
but without the middle frame on the top

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
but without the middle frame on the top
which<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.770> guess<00:00:34.950> we'll<00:00:35.460> drop<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> weight<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
which I guess we'll drop the weight so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.490 
which I guess we'll drop the weight so
we<00:00:36.719> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:39.500> notch

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
we kind of put it down it has this notch

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
we kind of put it down it has this notch
there<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.280> make<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.120> device

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
there which will make it the device

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
there which will make it the device
lighter<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.050> having<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.440> extra<00:00:43.620> metal

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
lighter not having this extra metal

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
lighter not having this extra metal
around<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> tub<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.780> point<00:00:46.020> five

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
around the tub this is a one point five

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
around the tub this is a one point five
kilos<00:00:46.800> which<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.579> pretty<00:00:47.940> light

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
kilos which is actually a pretty light

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.040 
kilos which is actually a pretty light
and<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.020> could<00:00:49.289> close<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.280> be

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
and if I could close this it would be

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
and if I could close this it would be
17.95<00:00:52.050> millimeters<00:00:52.949> thick<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:53.699> just

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
17.95 millimeters thick so that's just

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990 
17.95 millimeters thick so that's just
shy<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.360> 18<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.250> SD<00:00:56.430> card<00:00:56.610> reader

that I guess the answer is penetrate to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
that I guess the answer is penetrate to
