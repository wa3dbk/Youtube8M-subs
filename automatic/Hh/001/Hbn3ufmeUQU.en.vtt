00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 I walked the top batter 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.119
 Suddenly, already 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 Investment and living 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.869
 Is that so 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.570

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.930
 Akiba Akime 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.420

 2 death two or three 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.910
 Collaboration yourself 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.910
 Speaker that comes with Wood One Golf 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 Bad flow bad 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.380

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 etf the ball 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 The brand is an example 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 General start 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.159
 There is a catcher in the world 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.209
 And responsible for each 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.489
 As it is easy to go up to third place by 40 kilometers past 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.969
 I think it is a problem that I 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 Still maintain 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 Successful on the summit 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.479
 Another 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.169
 It seems Nakajima wasn't at home 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.169
 Recently cubase 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.259
 Successful stealing 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.439

 I prayed for 43 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.839

 Mr. Tatsumi's $ 3 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.929
 Hiring is good 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.949
 felica is heavy 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.699
 I got a second point 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.699
 It is off meeting example 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.289

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.289
 100 m with u-22 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.959
 The morning blue dragon turmoil has happened 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 It is the constitution of the association 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.419
 Nakajima of the third rain 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.979
 Membership is seven times 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.139
 I ran 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.139
 Government too 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.889
 Publish again 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.180
 Furthermore it is an original function 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.939
 The same will happen from -4 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.960
 This is better than the prospects after the second game 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.009
 This is a pattern 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.009
 Because this will be a big advantage 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.210
 Aiming for a match 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.210

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.599
 The fatality rate is the second win in a long time 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.089
 It is in 1 business name countdown 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.939
 The most important place 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.939
 It has been 4 consecutive losses 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.639
 This Seibu match loses six consecutive games 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.979
 There are not many leftovers here to come 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.770
 There is also a risk of escape 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.770
 I was impressed every time 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
