hey guys john here from JJ longboards
during<00:00:02.550> review<00:00:02.939> on<00:00:03.120> these<00:00:03.389> light<00:00:03.899> ray<00:00:04.440> trucks

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
during review on these light ray trucks

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.299 
during review on these light ray trucks
these<00:00:06.120> are<00:00:06.359> precision<00:00:06.960> trucks<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.649> they<00:00:08.040> have

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
these are precision trucks and they have

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.910 
these are precision trucks and they have
a<00:00:08.340> 45-degree<00:00:09.120> base<00:00:09.300> plate<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.349> hanger<00:00:10.710> with

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
a 45-degree base plate and a hanger with

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.629 
a 45-degree base plate and a hanger with
a<00:00:11.160> 180<00:00:12.000> millimeters<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.650> let's<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.280> into<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
a 180 millimeters so let's get into the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640 
a 180 millimeters so let's get into the
the<00:00:15.210> specs<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.660> thing<00:00:15.900> real<00:00:16.109> quick<00:00:16.170> these

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the specs of this thing real quick these

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.370 
the specs of this thing real quick these
are<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> light<00:00:17.250> rays<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:19.170> have

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
are the light rays and they they have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.810 
are the light rays and they they have
these<00:00:19.529> cutouts<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:20.609> will<00:00:20.730> not

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
these cutouts here that they will not

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.220 
these cutouts here that they will not
have<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> devil<00:00:21.750> rays<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.990> that<00:00:24.990> just

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
have on the devil rays and that just

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.750 
have on the devil rays and that just
makes<00:00:25.380> them<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> little<00:00:26.039> bit<00:00:26.220> lighter<00:00:26.430> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
makes them a little bit lighter I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.929 
makes them a little bit lighter I
believe<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> hangers<00:00:27.570> 25%<00:00:28.349> later<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
believe the hangers 25% later and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
believe the hangers 25% later and
overall<00:00:30.080> it's<00:00:31.080> around<00:00:31.439> twelve<00:00:32.009> fifteen

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
overall it's around twelve fifteen

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.270 
overall it's around twelve fifteen
percent<00:00:32.700> lighter<00:00:32.969> truck<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> weight<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
percent lighter truck but the weight of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.030 
percent lighter truck but the weight of
these<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.850> comparable<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.710> weight<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
these is comparable to the weight of a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
these is comparable to the weight of a
caliber<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.300> slightly<00:00:39.930> heavier<00:00:40.469> but

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
caliber these are slightly heavier but

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.330 
caliber these are slightly heavier but
just<00:00:41.070> barely<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:42.989> day<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:44.100> note

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just barely so that's some day to note

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
just barely so that's some day to note
so<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> hundred<00:00:45.960> eighty

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so these are the hundred eighty

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
so these are the hundred eighty
millimeters<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.340> since<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
millimeters they also since there's a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.139 
millimeters they also since there's a
movable<00:00:48.719> axles<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.149> 180

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
movable axles you can have them in a 180

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.830 
movable axles you can have them in a 180
190<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.140> 200<00:00:52.710> millimeters<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> something

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
190 and 200 millimeters but something

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
190 and 200 millimeters but something
about<00:00:55.110> these<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:57.059> annoying

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
about these is it's really annoying

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
about these is it's really annoying
having<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> deal<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.500> these<00:00:58.680> taking<00:00:59.430> them

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
having to deal with these taking them

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.869 
having to deal with these taking them
out<00:00:59.640> out<00:00:59.879> rather<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> fixed<00:01:01.109> axle<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.280> they

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
out out rather get a fixed axle but they

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.929 
out out rather get a fixed axle but they
don't<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.820> what<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
don't have that but it's what the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.580 
don't have that but it's what the
problem<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> thread<00:01:07.350> Locker

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
problem is is these have a thread Locker

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
problem is is these have a thread Locker
that<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.189> basically<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> solution<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that is basically a solution that you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
that is basically a solution that you
put<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.960> axle<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.950> screw<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
put on the axle as your screw it to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
put on the axle as your screw it to
screw<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> soak

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
screw it in but you really have to soak

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
screw it in but you really have to soak
it<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.549> for<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.119> able<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> stay<00:01:15.570> put

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it too for it to be able to stay put

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
it too for it to be able to stay put
otherwise<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.650> loosening<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.400> bolt

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
otherwise when you're loosening a bolt

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.780 
otherwise when you're loosening a bolt
on<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.240> wheel<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.830> take<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> wheel<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
on a wheel to take off the wheel it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
on a wheel to take off the wheel it
might<00:01:21.119> loosen<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> whole<00:01:22.380> axle<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> that's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
might loosen the whole axle and that's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
might loosen the whole axle and that's
just<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> pain<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.810> got<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> deal<00:01:25.290> with

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
just a pain because you got to deal with

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.640 
just a pain because you got to deal with
that<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.610> um<00:01:27.020> right<00:01:28.020> gives<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that but um right gives you a lot of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
that but um right gives you a lot of
options<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.150> also<00:01:30.299> give

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
options which I like and they also give

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
options which I like and they also give
you<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> base<00:01:31.110> plate<00:01:31.380> options<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.430> can

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you a lot of base plate options you can

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
you a lot of base plate options you can
range<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:32.880> 50<00:01:33.689> degrees<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.640> some<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.880> believe

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
range from 50 degrees to some I believe

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.100 
range from 50 degrees to some I believe
30<00:01:36.630> maybe<00:01:36.990> 35<00:01:38.090> from<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> range<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> these

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
30 maybe 35 from that range and these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
30 maybe 35 from that range and these
are<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> 45<00:01:40.710> again<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
are the 45 again and you also get a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
are the 45 again and you also get a
bunch<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> color<00:01:43.170> options<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.070> really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bunch of color options which I really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.719 
bunch of color options which I really
like<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.210> mean<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.399> red

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
like because I mean I like to have red

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.080 
like because I mean I like to have red
stuff<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.049> red<00:01:49.229> trucks<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.909> worked<00:01:50.909> out

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
stuff and I got red trucks so worked out

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
stuff and I got red trucks so worked out
but<00:01:51.899> i'll<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.409> more<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> writing<00:01:53.100> so

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
but i'll get more to the writing so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
but i'll get more to the writing so
these<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.320> shallow<00:01:55.530> bushing<00:01:56.070> seat

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
