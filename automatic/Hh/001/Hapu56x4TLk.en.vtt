we<00:00:15.660> believe<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.260> technology<00:00:16.890> should<00:00:17.070> be

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we believe the technology should be

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
we believe the technology should be
seamless<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.210> should<00:00:18.420> give<00:00:18.599> you<00:00:18.779> more

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
seamless and it should give you more

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:46.819 
technology
fundamentally<00:00:24.660> enhances

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.690 

there's<00:01:09.740> just<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:10.010> new<00:01:10.130> evolution<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
there's just a new evolution in the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.150 
there's just a new evolution in the
store<00:01:10.910> again<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.420> think<00:01:12.230> this<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.410> hot<00:01:12.740> that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
store again I think this is hot that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.850 
store again I think this is hot that
feels<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.700> tomorrow<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:15.290> really<00:01:15.650> really

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
feels like tomorrow it really really

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.860 
feels like tomorrow it really really
does<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.340> feels<00:01:16.850> like<00:01:17.030> tomorrow<00:01:17.360> you've<00:01:17.690> taken

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
does it feels like tomorrow you've taken

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.810 
does it feels like tomorrow you've taken
all<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.260> can<00:01:18.400> electronics<00:01:19.400> out<00:01:19.550> of<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
all that can electronics out of the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.670 
all that can electronics out of the
high-tech<00:01:20.570> cars<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:21.200> put<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.650> right

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
high-tech cars and just put it right

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.710 
high-tech cars and just put it right
here<00:01:21.800> honestly<00:01:22.160> it's<00:01:22.550> it's<00:01:23.270> gonna<00:01:23.420> change

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
here honestly it's it's gonna change

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.390 
here honestly it's it's gonna change
everything<00:01:23.870> when<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.590> put<00:01:24.800> on<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> Scully

the<00:01:28.070> system<00:01:28.430> Isuzu<00:01:29.180> journey<00:01:29.420> was<00:01:29.720> something

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the system Isuzu journey was something

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.740 
the system Isuzu journey was something
into<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> black<00:01:30.740> hole<00:01:31.420> yeah

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
into a black hole yeah

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.060

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
then suddenly he got a level of

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.469 
then suddenly he got a level of
innovation<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.880> had<00:01:35.030> been<00:01:35.210> fooled
