type of tail on the board tail shapes
some<00:00:11.700> people<00:00:12.030> will<00:00:12.120> say<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:13.080> tail

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
some people will say that you know tail

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
some people will say that you know tail
shapes<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.700> anything<00:00:15.120> they're<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.630> his

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
shapes don't do anything they're all his

shape or design or thing they all have
we<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.300> our<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> philosophies<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we all have our kind of philosophies and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.790 
we all have our kind of philosophies and
our<00:00:26.160> ideas<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.359> our<00:00:27.390> theories<00:00:27.930> personally

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
our ideas and our theories personally

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.859 
our ideas and our theories personally
for<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> tail<00:00:30.000> shape<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> more

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
for me I think that tail shape is more

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.749 
for me I think that tail shape is more
than<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.679> looks<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.520> something

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
than just looks I think it's something

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
than just looks I think it's something
that<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> functional<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> be

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that is functional but it's got to be

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.490 
that is functional but it's got to be
taken<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:37.040> it's<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.430> taken<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:39.500> toe

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
taken in it's got to be taken in toe

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.130 
taken in it's got to be taken in toe
kind<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> knot<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:41.550> emphasize<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.870> if

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
kind of a knot over emphasize because if

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
kind of a knot over emphasize because if
you<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.980> you've<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> lot

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you think about it you've got a lot

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.470 
you think about it you've got a lot
going<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.320> board<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> water

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going on with your board with the water

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
going on with your board with the water
the<00:00:48.840> way<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> water<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> engaging<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.160> board

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the way the water is engaging your board

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
the way the water is engaging your board
or<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> entry<00:00:51.239> through<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> bottom<00:00:52.140> through

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
or the entry through the bottom through

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
or the entry through the bottom through
your<00:00:52.680> tail<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:53.730> last<00:00:54.030> thing<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
your tail and the very last thing that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.389 
your tail and the very last thing that
the<00:00:55.050> water<00:00:55.260> does<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> leaving<00:00:56.129> your

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the water does is it's leaving your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
the water does is it's leaving your
board<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.629> bends<00:00:57.960> around<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.440> tail<00:00:58.649> shaped

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
board is it bends around the tail shaped

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.910 
board is it bends around the tail shaped
and<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.399> jumps<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.469> last<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and then jumps off and so that last a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
and then jumps off and so that last a
little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> tail<00:01:02.699> shape<00:01:03.110> yes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
little bit of the tail shape yes

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
little bit of the tail shape yes
it's<00:01:04.589> doing<00:01:04.949> something<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.600> doing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's doing something it's just not doing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's doing something it's just not doing
the<00:01:07.409> majority<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> rest<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the majority of what the rest of the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.360 
the majority of what the rest of the
board<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> doing<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
board is doing is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.160 
board is doing is
doing<00:01:10.580> that<00:01:10.730> last<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.150> little<00:01:11.270> bit<00:01:11.540> as<00:01:11.780> you're

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
doing that last a little bit as you're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.350 
doing that last a little bit as you're
like<00:01:12.380> coming<00:01:13.160> into<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.430> turn<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.940> if<00:01:14.180> you're

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
like coming into a turn and if you're

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.880 
like coming into a turn and if you're
coming<00:01:15.230> out<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.620> turn<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:18.230> so<00:01:18.560> the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
coming out of the turn and and so the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.620 
coming out of the turn and and so the
way<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.100> understand<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.850> tale<00:01:20.030> states<00:01:20.390> is

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
way to understand the tale states is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.770 
way to understand the tale states is
that<00:01:20.680> water<00:01:21.680> which<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.420> actually<00:01:23.750> a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
that water which is like it's actually a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.750 
that water which is like it's actually a
sticky<00:01:24.170> substance<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.280> coming<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.610> your

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
sticky substance it's coming in your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.940 
sticky substance it's coming in your
board<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:26.570> like<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.170> grabbing<00:01:27.680> your

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
board and it's like it's grabbing your

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.470 
board and it's like it's grabbing your
board<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.610> shape<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.060> board<00:01:29.300> is

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
board and the shape of the board is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.680 
board and the shape of the board is
dictating<00:01:30.200> how<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.710> waters<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.850> know<00:01:31.970> either

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
dictating how the waters you know either

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.570 
dictating how the waters you know either
hanging<00:01:33.320> onto<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.590> board<00:01:33.830> or<00:01:34.130> Haussmann

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
hanging onto the board or Haussmann

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.550 
hanging onto the board or Haussmann
force<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.150> water<00:01:35.270> off<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.600> board<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.170> that's

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
force the water off the board and that's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.290 
force the water off the board and that's
what's<00:01:36.800> going<00:01:37.010> to<00:01:37.040> give<00:01:37.220> different<00:01:37.970> words<00:01:38.180> a

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
what's going to give different words a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.710 
what's going to give different words a
different<00:01:38.660> feel<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:40.850> as<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.450> water

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
different feel and and so as this water

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.010 
different feel and and so as this water
is<00:01:41.900> coming<00:01:42.080> around<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.560> board<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.610> know

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
is coming around the board it's you know

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.840 
is coming around the board it's you know
hitting<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.230> edges<00:01:45.560> back<00:01:45.800> here<00:01:46.130> or<00:01:46.460> leasing

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
hitting the edges back here or leasing

as it's going through a turn you know

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.300 
as it's going through a turn you know
that<00:01:53.240> water<00:01:53.480> is<00:01:53.630> holding<00:01:54.080> holding<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.770> it's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
kind of you do concepts starting with a

kind of you do concepts starting with a
squash<00:03:05.640> tail<00:03:05.940> which<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.510> most<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.890> know
