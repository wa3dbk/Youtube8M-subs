00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.980
 a robot respect and I own 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.490
 this and 911 from 1988 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.510
 original 2 tsp and is a 3 point 2 liter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.980
 engine in and original holds one 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.570
 231 hp sit down and I am very sorry 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 curious what is actually still mine 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.260
 many years did 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.130
 well i have to say the car does 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.590
 exceptionally good with regard to what 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.530
 that should do standard power 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.350
 but then there is indeed a good 30hp 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.060
 beyond now is true that with portia 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.680
 are they always in their polders are they 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.750
 always give them very carefully 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.820
 basically usually not enough 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.320
 because if they are measured with the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.960
 they have new ones of more than sufficient 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.760
 never the whining 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.080
 if a car delivers enough, say 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.390
 you always have more than enough but 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.230
 this area exceptionally good so very 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.230
 neat for the age 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.340
 unbelievable i never had that myself 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.990
 very, very say , especially in the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.430
 number of tours not 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.960
 and if you do n't see it and it goes 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 just basically just continue 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.400
 yes i think it is really upstairs 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.229
 my expectations are absolutely that 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.119
 has more power than ever in the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.430
 leaflet had you expected it 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.869
 no actually not a car of 23 years 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.250
 i-cut will see why 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.979
 probably had less yield 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780
 are tomorrow and yes if you still have 30hp 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.340
 more leafy performs yes 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 fantastic to hear
