00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's bit of a bulge eNOS that I can come
closer<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:01.149> closer<00:01:02.140> basically<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.629> not

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
position I made this top surface is not

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.449 
position I made this top surface is not
exposed<00:02:00.429> to<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> ground<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.679> mean<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:02.860> also

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
exposed to the ground I mean and also

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.650 
exposed to the ground I mean and also
the<00:02:05.129> account<00:02:06.129> is<00:02:06.250> basically<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:06.970> falls<00:02:07.420> on

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
the account is basically if it falls on

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.699 
the account is basically if it falls on
this<00:02:07.929> let's<00:02:08.679> say<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.039> come<00:02:09.940> over<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.420> way

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this let's say this come over this way

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.920 
this let's say this come over this way
or<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:12.040> way<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.610> basic<00:02:12.940> extent<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.450> fully

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
or this way so basic extent it is fully

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.920 
or this way so basic extent it is fully
covered<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.610> curve<00:02:15.910> curved<00:02:16.360> part<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.750> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
covered that the curve curved part of it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.400 
covered that the curve curved part of it
which<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.770> really<00:02:17.800> good<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.260> that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
which is really good and I can see that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.150 
which is really good and I can see that
it<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:21.580> really<00:02:22.120> solid<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.290> also<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.890> comes

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
it is really solid and also it comes

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.699 
it is really solid and also it comes
with<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> many<00:02:24.730> colors<00:02:25.120> basically<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.500> can

attached to the pan and in the latter
part<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.230> video<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:45.579> most<00:02:45.819> important

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
part of the video the most important

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.720 
part of the video the most important
when<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.290> choose<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.739> casing<00:02:48.220> basically

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
choose the casebook it's a first to both

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.259 
choose the casebook it's a first to both
then<00:02:53.220> charged<00:02:54.220> upon<00:02:54.400> basically<00:02:54.909> yeah<00:02:55.060> they're

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
then charged upon basically yeah they're

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.720 
then charged upon basically yeah they're
using<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.780> USB<00:02:56.019> cable<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.159> are<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
using the USB cable are the are the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.850 
using the USB cable are the are the
magnetic<00:02:58.480> child<00:02:58.750> especially<00:02:59.260> about<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.769> it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
magnetic child especially about is it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.550 
magnetic child especially about is it
because<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.549> are<00:03:00.700> hearing<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.269> are

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
because if you are hearing at are

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.949 
because if you are hearing at are
charging<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.879> basically<00:03:03.879> this<00:03:04.150> has<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.780> be

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
charging that basically this has to be

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.220 
charging that basically this has to be
there<00:03:05.379> and<00:03:05.790> also<00:03:06.790> liked<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.450> as<00:03:07.629> you<00:03:08.140> all

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
there and also liked it as you all

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.229 
there and also liked it as you all
recommend<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.160> use<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.819> one<00:03:10.060> for

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
recommend you to use this one for

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.660 
recommend you to use this one for
charging<00:03:10.690> rather<00:03:10.870> than<00:03:10.959> they<00:03:11.170> using<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.670> USB

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
charging rather than they using the USB

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.089 
charging rather than they using the USB
one<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.180> reason<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.629> if<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:14.379> open<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.890> many

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
one the reason is if you open to many

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.720 
one the reason is if you open to many
times<00:03:15.340> often<00:03:15.549> then<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.310> loosened

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
times often then then this get loosened

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.789 
times often then then this get loosened
and<00:03:18.900> eventually<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.019> lose<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.650> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
and eventually you lose that is a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.520 
and eventually you lose that is a
waterproof<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:22.150> feature<00:03:22.450> because<00:03:23.079> once

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
waterproof that feature because once

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.170 
waterproof that feature because once
it's<00:03:23.739> looser<00:03:23.920> than<00:03:24.069> their<00:03:24.400> own<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:25.000> what<00:03:25.150> I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
it's looser than their own for what I

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.319 
it's looser than their own for what I
get<00:03:25.450> inside<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.019> get<00:03:26.200> spoil<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.769> entire<00:03:26.859> form

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
get inside and get spoil the entire form

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.670 
get inside and get spoil the entire form

in the latter part of the video and the
fixing<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.359> straightforward<00:03:37.660> just<00:03:38.169> position

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
fixing is straightforward just position

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.470 
fixing is straightforward just position
and<00:03:38.859> then<00:03:39.040> fixing<00:03:39.519> what<00:03:39.760> they<00:03:39.970> again<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.359> have
