their fringes that make them resemble

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
crowns or Coronas so it's related to

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.779 
crowns or Coronas so it's related to
SARS<00:04:15.239> yes<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.109> for<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.440> matter<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.190> HCO

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
SARS yes but for that matter so is HCO

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.990
