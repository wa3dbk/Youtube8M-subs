00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
top here which is just carbon and then

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
top here which is just carbon and then
I'll<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.590> straight<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> the

college branded but this is a I believe
at<00:02:11.819> exit<00:02:12.300> Drive<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> flip<00:02:13.200> out

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
at exit Drive is a flip out

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.490 
at exit Drive is a flip out
one<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:14.880> gigabyte<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.260> put

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
one and it's one gigabyte so that so put

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.030 
one and it's one gigabyte so that so put
that<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:18.600> one<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.350> two

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that there and this one is a two

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.970 
that there and this one is a two
gigabyte<00:02:20.310> SanDisk<00:02:21.270> model<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.710> two

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
gigabyte SanDisk model there you go two

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.560 
gigabyte SanDisk model there you go two
gigabytes<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.490> disk<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.180> forms<00:02:24.540> a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
gigabytes and disk and it's a forms a

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.630 
gigabytes and disk and it's a forms a
nice<00:02:24.720> ball<00:02:24.750> three<00:02:25.170> branded<00:02:25.590> one<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.220> came<00:02:26.460> with

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
nice ball three branded one it came with

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.300 
nice ball three branded one it came with
the<00:02:26.760> limited<00:02:27.120> edition<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.660> Forza<00:02:28.080> 3<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.100> we

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the limited edition of Forza 3 so if we

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
the limited edition of Forza 3 so if we
line<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
line them all up there you can see that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.950 
line them all up there you can see that
this<00:02:31.320> 16<00:02:32.010> gigabyte<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> flash<00:02:32.640> drive<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.420> indeed

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
this 16 gigabyte a flash drive is indeed

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.060 
this 16 gigabyte a flash drive is indeed
absolutely<00:02:34.430> tiny<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:37.710> these<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:37.920> two

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
absolutely tiny and now these are two

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.790 
absolutely tiny and now these are two
fairly<00:02:38.640> standard<00:02:39.060> size<00:02:39.240> memory<00:02:40.200> sticks<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
fairly standard size memory sticks and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.440 
fairly standard size memory sticks and
this<00:02:41.010> thing<00:02:41.280> I'm<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> put<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
this thing I'm going to put it in the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.370 
this thing I'm going to put it in the
palm<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> my<00:02:42.810> hand

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
palm of my hand

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.090 
palm of my hand
and<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.270> see<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.110> very<00:02:46.440> small<00:02:46.740> very

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
and you can see it is very small very

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.250 
and you can see it is very small very
minimalist<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> thread<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
minimalist so I'm going to thread this

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.610 
minimalist so I'm going to thread this
one<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.530> my<00:02:49.620> keys<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.390> keys<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:53.360> and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
one to my keys I have the keys here and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.550 
one to my keys I have the keys here and
the<00:02:55.620> idea<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.250> hook<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.320> with

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the idea is to hook it on like this with

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
the idea is to hook it on like this with
one<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.740> these<00:02:58.860> sort<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.160> hooks<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.690> carry<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
one of these sort of hooks and carry it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.570 
one of these sort of hooks and carry it
on<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.959> keys<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> because<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:01.980> small

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
on the keys and because it's so small

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.210 
on the keys and because it's so small
and<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.180> can't<00:03:03.450> date<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.870> hand<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.440> when

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and I can't date with one hand but when

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
and I can't date with one hand but when
it's<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> keyring<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.870> won't

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's actually on that keyring it won't

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's actually on that keyring it won't
be<00:03:07.260> very<00:03:07.500> introduced<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.130> unlike<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> larger

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
be very introduced if unlike a larger

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.750 
be very introduced if unlike a larger
memory<00:03:09.060> stick<00:03:09.390> why<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.570> would<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.160> yep

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
memory stick why this would be so yep

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.590 
memory stick why this would be so yep
that's<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.090> guys<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.380> my<00:03:13.560> unboxing<00:03:13.800> and

that's it guys that is my unboxing and

that's it guys that is my unboxing and
they<00:03:15.600> were<00:03:15.660> quick<00:03:15.900> saw<00:03:16.110> off<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.970> Kingston
