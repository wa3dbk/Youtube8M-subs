offensively<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.170> know<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:54.800> even<00:01:55.340> that

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
offensively you know but but even that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.790 
offensively you know but but even that
execution<00:01:56.240> wasn't<00:01:56.630> exactly<00:01:57.080> great<00:01:57.500> our

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
execution wasn't exactly great our

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.650 
execution wasn't exactly great our
efforts<00:01:58.190> good<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.820> know<00:01:58.970> our<00:01:59.060> physical<00:01:59.540> you

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
efforts good you know our physical you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.109 
efforts good you know our physical you
know<00:01:59.810> our<00:02:00.229> physical<00:02:00.650> presence<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:01.460> and

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
know our physical presence is there and

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.510 
know our physical presence is there and
so<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:02.570> just<00:02:02.720> need<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.140> continue<00:02:03.830> stay<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.430> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
so we just need to continue stay in the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.460 
so we just need to continue stay in the
course<00:02:04.729> with<00:02:05.300> cleaning<00:02:05.840> up<00:02:05.960> everything<00:02:06.440> but

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
course with cleaning up everything but

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.259 
course with cleaning up everything but
today<00:02:07.040> was<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.250> much<00:02:07.460> better<00:02:07.700> day<00:02:07.940> overall

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
today was a much better day overall

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.479 
today was a much better day overall
offensively<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.290> 11<00:02:09.800> well<00:02:10.160> how<00:02:10.250> many<00:02:10.399> ever

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
offensively with 11 well how many ever

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.600 
offensively with 11 well how many ever
guys<00:02:10.760> took<00:02:11.510> snaps<00:02:11.870> but<00:02:12.769> we<00:02:12.950> executed<00:02:13.489> it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
guys took snaps but we executed it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.340 
guys took snaps but we executed it
better<00:02:13.790> today<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> run<00:02:14.630> game<00:02:14.660> into<00:02:15.080> pass

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
better today in the run game into pass

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.140 
better today in the run game into pass
game<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> flow<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:16.610> better<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
game so and the flow was better so that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.670 
game so and the flow was better so that
just<00:02:17.360> means<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.720> our<00:02:17.870> communication<00:02:18.290> is

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
just means that our communication is

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
just means that our communication is
better<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.040> kids<00:02:19.280> are<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.610> getting<00:02:20.360> a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
better and kids are just getting a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.660 
better and kids are just getting a
better<00:02:20.690> grasp<00:02:21.019> on<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.190> envision<00:02:22.459> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
better grasp on do you envision a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.580 
better grasp on do you envision a
scenario<00:02:22.790> where<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.300> throw<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> ball<00:02:24.470> around

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
scenario where you throw the ball around

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.650 
scenario where you throw the ball around
to<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> dozen<00:02:25.459> different<00:02:25.640> receivers<00:02:26.300> or<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.570> you

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
to a dozen different receivers or do you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.560 
to a dozen different receivers or do you
want<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.350> two<00:02:27.830> three<00:02:27.860> guys<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.760> sort<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.090> men

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
want one two three guys that sort of men

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.330 
want one two three guys that sort of men
both<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.110> mean<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.410> can<00:02:30.530> look<00:02:30.739> back<00:02:30.950> throughout

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
both I mean you can look back throughout

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
both I mean you can look back throughout
years<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.180> we've<00:02:32.420> had<00:02:32.570> 12<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.019> 13

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
years and I think we've had 12 and 13

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.140 
years and I think we've had 12 and 13
guys<00:02:33.620> catch<00:02:33.950> balls<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.489> game

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
guys catch balls in the game

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.690 
guys catch balls in the game
there's<00:02:35.930> been<00:02:36.079> places<00:02:36.560> where<00:02:36.709> we've<00:02:36.860> had<00:02:37.069> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
there's been places where we've had you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.910 
there's been places where we've had you
know<00:02:37.730> three<00:02:38.390> guys<00:02:38.599> over<00:02:38.959> 100<00:02:39.290> receptions<00:02:39.590> in

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
know three guys over 100 receptions in

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.640 
know three guys over 100 receptions in
one<00:02:40.129> year<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:41.420> depends<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.959> how<00:02:42.590> many

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
one year it just depends on how many

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.259 
one year it just depends on how many
playmakers<00:02:43.159> you<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.090> more

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
playmakers you have really the more

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.640 
playmakers you have really the more
playmakers<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.170> more<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:45.409> can

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
playmakers you have the more you can

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.050 
playmakers you have the more you can
stretch<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.040> all<00:02:46.189> around<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.670> mean<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.879> wasn't

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
stretch them all around I mean it wasn't

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.390 
stretch them all around I mean it wasn't
necessarily<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.689> way<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.829> last<00:02:49.010> couple<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
necessarily that way the last couple of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.309 
necessarily that way the last couple of
years<00:02:49.459> we<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.879> one<00:02:50.060> guy<00:02:50.299> but<00:02:50.599> we<00:02:50.810> did<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.170> me

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
years we have one guy but we did to me

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.920 
years we have one guy but we did to me
if<00:02:51.409> you<00:02:51.500> look<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.859> I<00:02:52.069> think<00:02:52.700> Kevin<00:02:53.000> 119<00:02:53.750> or

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
if you look at I think Kevin 119 or

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.030 
if you look at I think Kevin 119 or
whatever<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.439> then<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.799> look<00:02:54.859> at<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
whatever but then if you look at the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.520 
whatever but then if you look at the
next<00:02:55.280> guy<00:02:55.400> had<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.700> 70<00:02:56.299> that's<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.079> that's

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
next guy had like 70 that's not that's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.259 
next guy had like 70 that's not that's
usually<00:02:57.890> leaving<00:02:58.189> the<00:02:58.280> team<00:02:58.459> anywhere<00:02:59.060> else

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
usually leaving the team anywhere else

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.899 
usually leaving the team anywhere else
you<00:02:59.450> talking<00:02:59.900> about<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.349> yeah<00:03:00.980> hopefully<00:03:01.220> you

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
you talking about so yeah hopefully you

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.089 
you talking about so yeah hopefully you
know<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> ball<00:03:02.329> gate<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:02.890> ultimately<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
know the ball gate but ultimately the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.369 
know the ball gate but ultimately the
ball<00:03:04.280> finds<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.269> best<00:03:05.450> guy<00:03:05.569> alive<00:03:06.049> you

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
ball finds the the best guy alive you

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.140 
ball finds the the best guy alive you
know<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.859> so<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.400> not<00:03:07.489> like<00:03:07.670> we<00:03:07.819> sit<00:03:08.000> there

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
know and so it's not like we sit there

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.250 
know and so it's not like we sit there
and<00:03:08.239> tell<00:03:08.420> them<00:03:08.450> looking<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.959> throw<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.170> to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
and tell them looking and throw it to

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.710 
and tell them looking and throw it to
this<00:03:09.349> guy<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.120> they're<00:03:11.120> not<00:03:11.239> done<00:03:11.450> meeting

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
this guy but they're not done meeting

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.660 
this guy but they're not done meeting
try<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.379> get<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.590> best<00:03:12.739> guys<00:03:13.010> involved<00:03:13.370> so

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
try to get the best guys involved so

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.460 
try to get the best guys involved so
hopefully<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:14.329> are<00:03:14.359> spreading<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.959> around<00:03:15.019> two

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
hopefully we are spreading it around two

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.440 
hopefully we are spreading it around two
running<00:03:16.190> backs<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.609> receivers<00:03:16.730> that's<00:03:17.269> when

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
running backs and receivers that's when

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.670 
running backs and receivers that's when
you're<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.720> best<00:03:17.930> i<00:03:18.109> think<00:03:18.349> because<00:03:18.500> they

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you're the best i think because they

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.110 
you're the best i think because they
can't<00:03:18.950> really<00:03:19.159> hone<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.639> on<00:03:19.790> where<00:03:19.970> you're

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
can't really hone in on where you're

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.940 
can't really hone in on where you're
going<00:03:20.299> with<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.510> have<00:03:20.989> some<00:03:21.170> guys<00:03:21.319> elevated

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
going with it have some guys elevated

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.410 
going with it have some guys elevated
sort<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.370> prison<00:03:22.760> at<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:22.939> top<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.150> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
sort of prison at the top of that
