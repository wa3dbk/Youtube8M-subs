there's no sale of any rivers I mean the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280 
there's no sale of any rivers I mean the
fact<00:06:05.670> that<00:06:05.820> matter<00:06:06.030> is<00:06:06.150> putting<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.720> work<00:06:06.930> an

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
fact that matter is putting to work an

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.290 
fact that matter is putting to work an
asset<00:06:07.740> that's<00:06:07.980> there<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.430> think<00:06:09.000> what<00:06:09.150> we're

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
asset that's there I think what we're

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.030 
asset that's there I think what we're
really<00:06:09.480> saying<00:06:09.840> is<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.350> those<00:06:10.650> those

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
really saying is you and those those

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.470 
really saying is you and those those
assets<00:06:11.520> are<00:06:11.610> always<00:06:11.970> going<00:06:12.090> to<00:06:12.180> be<00:06:12.240> there<00:06:12.420> for

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
assets are always going to be there for

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.940 
assets are always going to be there for
British<00:06:12.870> Columbians<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.470> river<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.860> the

British Columbians the river and the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.470 
British Columbians the river and the
water<00:06:14.190> is<00:06:14.310> going<00:06:14.490> to<00:06:14.580> be<00:06:14.640> there<00:06:14.790> for<00:06:14.820> beloved's

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
water is going to be there for beloved's

water is going to be there for beloved's
again<00:06:16.320> you<00:06:16.530> know<00:06:16.620> one<00:06:16.770> of<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.950> things<00:06:16.980> that

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
again you know one of the things that

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.860 
again you know one of the things that
we're<00:06:17.490> aware<00:06:17.610> of<00:06:17.760> it's<00:06:18.030> not<00:06:18.210> just<00:06:18.480> that<00:06:18.540> water

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
we're aware of it's not just that water

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.110 
we're aware of it's not just that water
for<00:06:19.200> energy<00:06:19.560> is<00:06:19.770> also<00:06:20.160> water<00:06:20.340> for<00:06:20.670> agriculture

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
for energy is also water for agriculture

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.970 
for energy is also water for agriculture
its<00:06:21.450> water<00:06:21.690> for<00:06:21.930> industry<00:06:22.350> as<00:06:22.500> water<00:06:22.770> for

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
its water for industry as water for

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.800 
its water for industry as water for
residences<00:06:23.430> so<00:06:23.640> one<00:06:24.210> of<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.390> things<00:06:24.450> that<00:06:24.750> you

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
residences so one of the things that you

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.780 
residences so one of the things that you
have<00:06:24.930> to<00:06:24.990> go<00:06:25.200> through<00:06:25.440> is<00:06:25.590> a<00:06:25.890> review<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.640> the

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
have to go through is a review of the

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.340 
have to go through is a review of the
demands<00:06:27.390> that<00:06:27.600> we're<00:06:27.720> putting<00:06:27.870> on<00:06:28.050> our<00:06:28.080> water

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
demands that we're putting on our water

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.740 
demands that we're putting on our water
systems<00:06:28.740> for<00:06:29.190> many<00:06:29.340> of<00:06:30.090> us<00:06:30.210> are<00:06:32.360> 204<00:06:33.360> notes<00:06:33.390> I'm

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
systems for many of us are 204 notes I'm

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.750 
systems for many of us are 204 notes I'm
saying<00:06:34.110> that<00:06:34.200> it's<00:06:34.770> not<00:06:34.860> clean<00:06:35.310> energy<00:06:35.730> and

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
saying that it's not clean energy and

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.740 
saying that it's not clean energy and
that<00:06:36.150> it's<00:06:36.360> going<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.900> destroy<00:06:37.290> the<00:06:37.410> equation

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
that it's going to destroy the equation

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.330 
that it's going to destroy the equation
it<00:06:39.750> isn't<00:06:40.080> energy<00:06:40.530> and<00:06:40.710> you<00:06:40.830> know<00:06:40.920> I<00:06:40.950> mean<00:06:41.220> they

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
it isn't energy and you know I mean they

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.760 
it isn't energy and you know I mean they
can<00:06:41.490> say<00:06:41.700> it's<00:06:41.880> not<00:06:42.060> people<00:06:42.690> will<00:06:43.050> I<00:06:43.080> guess<00:06:43.380> say

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
can say it's not people will I guess say

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.410 
can say it's not people will I guess say
what<00:06:43.920> they<00:06:44.010> want<00:06:44.190> to<00:06:44.250> say<00:06:44.400> I<00:06:44.760> think<00:06:45.030> if<00:06:45.270> you

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
what they want to say I think if you

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.620 
what they want to say I think if you
asked<00:06:46.280> five<00:06:47.280> hundred<00:06:47.700> scientists<00:06:48.270> the<00:06:48.450> vast

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
asked five hundred scientists the vast

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.240 
asked five hundred scientists the vast
majority<00:06:48.780> would<00:06:49.260> tell<00:06:49.470> you<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.710> hydropower

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
majority would tell you the hydropower

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.740 
majority would tell you the hydropower
is<00:06:50.460> one<00:06:50.640> of<00:06:50.700> the<00:06:50.760> cleanest<00:06:51.000> sources<00:06:51.540> of<00:06:51.600> energy

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
is one of the cleanest sources of energy

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.720 
is one of the cleanest sources of energy
we<00:06:52.020> have<00:06:52.200> and<00:06:53.010> I<00:06:53.130> think<00:06:53.160> that<00:06:53.460> one<00:06:53.580> of<00:06:53.610> the

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
we have and I think that one of the

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.950 
we have and I think that one of the
things<00:06:53.790> we<00:06:54.090> have<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.360> be<00:06:54.450> honest<00:06:54.750> with<00:06:54.840> you

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
things we have to be honest with you

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.270 
things we have to be honest with you
about<00:06:54.990> is<00:06:55.470> if<00:06:55.620> we're<00:06:55.770> going<00:06:55.890> to<00:06:55.950> require

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
about is if we're going to require

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.730 
about is if we're going to require
energy<00:06:56.550> and<00:06:57.450> we<00:06:57.630> do<00:06:57.780> you've<00:06:57.930> got<00:06:57.960> a<00:06:58.110> technology

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
energy and we do you've got a technology

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.530 
energy and we do you've got a technology
industry<00:06:59.100> based<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.490> building<00:06:59.850> here<00:07:00.030> in<00:07:00.060> else
