00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello to all today we talked and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.740
 exercises to strengthen the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.440
 forearm wrists hands 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 also so it goes through several 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.080
 muscle building exercises 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.590
 as then by the first exercise 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.170
 which is done with a big bar 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.730
 possibly hairs on the paper 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.609
 so in fact it's the realization was 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.320
 quite simple we take the bar as 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 these are the palms of the hands the green 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 up and then we just go 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.399
 do wrist flexions 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.399
 like these quite slowly 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.950
 here 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.340
 so for target is really all 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 Forearm muscles discouraged 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.340
 general to have this same exercise done 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.340
 with the palms of the hands to the ground 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.170
 organization virtually the same 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.980
 here 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.260
 that's it for this exercise 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.270
 for whom this exercise and creates 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.410
 tensions in the shoulder and I know 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.560
 that with this is not necessarily comfortable 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.020
 with with the straight bar like that in 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 there is an alternative with a second 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.350
 exercise 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.660
 we're going to do with this summer actually I was 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.770
 there the principle is the same we will do 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.330
 flexions like that the handles the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.550
 palm up and down 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.550
 with both arms 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.850
 here 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.470
 and finally there is a third exercise 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.450
 with his two little worries and ingrid on 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.360
 find that in all the stores of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.910
 sport 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.600
 it's quite practical it's very small 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 so to carry his part is in 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.360
 it's pretty simple so we're going 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 simply exert pressure 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.930
 that's very simple so she steals her 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.220
 three exercises 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.380
 do not forget to put time between 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.600
 each series 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.060
 similarly between each session 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.540
 it's for to try their skin 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 muscle also think about increasing the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 loads in order to always progress and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.250
 reach a good level 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.250
 let's see
