00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.750
 other recent caloric holidays 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.789
 now a distant memory and of the case of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.130
 start doing some diet this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.769
 yet he is either low-calorie because he is not 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.590
 made with potatoes but is made with 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.170
 a vegetable with the celery hall ramp 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.420
 morata is a vegetable that tastes of celery but 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.820
 very delicate and that however lends itself 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.040
 also very well to become it too 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
 I cook in milk when it is cooked 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.050
 and it takes about a fortnight 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.250
 minutes it was good with the blender and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.430
 I observe it buman accompaniment of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 meat or new for example 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.579
 in short, the side dish for 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 make it richer if 17 direct if 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.670
 you want to add a little bit of flavors 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 even more if I tell you it's a lot 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.399
 very pleasant and pleasant flavor 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 also simply so 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.510
 add a small piece of butter 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.150
 a bit of Parmesan cheese for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.870
 enrich it further 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.790
 I hope you like the idea 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.000
 I repeat let 's try to stay a little bit 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.910
 diet in this period considering that natal 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.730
 he was very rich and this is alla 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.070
 next ingredients do not need a ramp 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.130
 skim milk just a pinch 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.570
 of salt and a little pepper and butter pleasure 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.550
 if you are not on a diet 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.210
 here is the secret ingredient of mine 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.460
 also hypocaloric it gives an installment is one 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.230
 vegetables that I find in Bolzano with extreme 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.570
 ease here in siena a little less 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.120
 but in the end, even at the supermarket yes 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.020
 find I found the acronym to this one 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.170
 bizarre form I use it with the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.000
 pure to make puree and without potatoes 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.680
 only if Europe 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.840
 you can use it safely too 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 as it is from normal therefore in the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.640
 soups for example first thing 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.420
 clearly I peel it and then cut it a 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.910
 pieces 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.119
 then either peeled and sedanorapa now 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.130
 I cut it into cubes 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.160
 I use it all for myself this was here 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:20.120
 all around me there are 230 left 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.580
 g once peeled you can use it 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.350
 for many preparations also boiled 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 as a vegetable boiled in steam to a lot e 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.290
 very versatile I also like raw dir 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.270
 the truth and has a taste of celery but 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.270
 very delicate and much much more 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.239
 delicate celery like flavor 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.080
 sweetish now let's say the increase in one 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.930
 pot or deep enough and add 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.020
 of skimmed milk to cover it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.450
 I use slightly skimmed milk 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.849
 because I want it to be 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 a live outline you can even before 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.330
 boil it in plain water and then one 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.290
 time you go to pass it or blend it 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.879
 add a goccino of milk per 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.590
 make it creamier 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.690
 I add a little salt and I do it 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.790
 it doesn't take much to boil above all 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.670
 because it should be cut into small pieces let's say 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.709
 in 10 minutes the celeriac and cooked celery e 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.250
 soft by inserting the fork is 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.519
 soft 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:30.170
 at this point I do nothing but 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:33.230
 pass it with the blender mine is also 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.079
 ready if you want a little bit harder the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.610
 put back on the fire for a few moments 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.700
 always turning because then clearly if 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.090
 no stick to the pot and if not to me 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.220
 also like it so beautifully creamy 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.209
 I add a little bit of ground pepper on the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.400
 moment if you want to keep it 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.650
 low calorie is ready closed here vi 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.420
 I assure you it is still very much followed 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 otherwise you can add a walnut of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.700
 butter to make it a little richer
