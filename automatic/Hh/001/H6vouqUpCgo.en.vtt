one<00:01:09.930> fail<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.770> grip<00:01:11.100> bends<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> little

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
one fail the grip bends in just a little

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
one fail the grip bends in just a little
bit<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.530> fingers<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
star line is very convenient and as you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
star line is very convenient and as you
can<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> b3<00:01:22.020> model<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
can see this is the b3 model this is the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
can see this is the b3 model this is the
exact<00:01:23.340> same<00:01:23.520> design<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> use<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.630> all<00:01:24.750> my

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869

most<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> my<00:01:27.960> all-around<00:01:28.619> distance<00:01:29.579> races

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
most of my all-around distance races

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
most of my all-around distance races
over<00:01:30.360> ocean<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> production<00:01:32.159> model

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
over ocean and for the production model

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
over ocean and for the production model
we<00:01:32.460> decided<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> year<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.509> 27<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we decided to go this year at 27 and a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
we decided to go this year at 27 and a
half<00:01:34.229> inches<00:01:34.590> wide<00:01:34.650> makes<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> super<00:01:36.090> stable

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
half inches wide makes it super stable

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.560 
half inches wide makes it super stable
the<00:01:37.140> leaders<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> are<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.369> 228<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the leaders on this are about 228 so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
the leaders on this are about 228 so
this<00:01:39.689> actually<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.110> handle<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.619> about<00:01:40.979> 200

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this actually can handle up to about 200

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.859 
this actually can handle up to about 200
pound<00:01:41.640> person<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> 12-6

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.420 
carbon board for about three months now
and<00:02:27.870> these<00:02:28.500> things<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:28.920> pretty<00:02:29.040> bulletproof

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and these things are pretty bulletproof

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.100 
and these things are pretty bulletproof
for<00:02:29.910> race<00:02:30.060> boards<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:30.600> what<00:02:30.720> I've<00:02:30.840> been<00:02:30.870> on

this<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.330> 12-6<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> also<00:02:52.140> comes<00:02:52.440> at<00:02:52.560> 14<00:02:52.950> by<00:02:53.100> 27

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
this is a 12-6 it also comes at 14 by 27

this is a 12-6 it also comes at 14 by 27
all<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.540> found<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.110> they<00:02:55.319> may<00:02:55.470> be<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.650> little<00:02:55.860> bit

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
all we found is they may be a little bit

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.130 
all we found is they may be a little bit
narrow<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.610> they<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.180> very<00:02:57.480> stable

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
narrow but they are very stable

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.080 
narrow but they are very stable
we<00:02:58.530> incorporated<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.310> wide<00:02:59.549> tail<00:02:59.819> design

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
we incorporated this wide tail design

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.120 
we incorporated this wide tail design
and<00:03:00.540> by<00:03:00.930> carrying<00:03:01.200> some<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:01.769> behind

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and by carrying some that with behind

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.670 
and by carrying some that with behind
you<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:03.120> creates<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.720> lot<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.959> stability<00:03:04.530> for

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you and creates a lot of stability for

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.650 
you and creates a lot of stability for
the<00:03:04.739> racers<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.880> recessed<00:03:06.360> deck

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the racers and then this recessed deck

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.900 
the racers and then this recessed deck
get<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.830> close<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> waterline<00:03:08.670> as

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
get you as close to the waterline as

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.610 
get you as close to the waterline as
possible<00:03:09.390> without<00:03:09.540> digging<00:03:09.870> up<00:03:10.019> full<00:03:10.200> cockpit

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
