00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you're wondering what is the 40 system

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.810 
you're wondering what is the 40 system
the<00:00:48.989> 40<00:00:49.590> system<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> new<00:00:50.760> series<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> late

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
the 40 system is a new series of a late

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.779 
the 40 system is a new series of a late
and<00:00:54.230> if<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.829> compare<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> old

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and if you compare it with the old

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.770 
and if you compare it with the old
series<00:00:57.770> only<00:00:58.820> some<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> beyblades<00:01:00.420> can

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
series only some of the beyblades can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.060 
series only some of the beyblades can
change<00:01:01.199> modes<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.120> 40<00:01:03.510> system<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:04.320> all

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
change modes in the 40 system all all

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.850 
change modes in the 40 system all all
the<00:01:05.820> series<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> 40<00:01:06.869> system<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.500> change

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the series from the 40 system can change

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.850 
the series from the 40 system can change
modes<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:09.350> because<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:12.540> has<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.590> layers

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
modes now because the it has two layers

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
modes now because the it has two layers
of<00:01:14.250> metal<00:01:15.180> wheel<00:01:15.920> that's<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.570> first

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of metal wheel that's the for first

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
of metal wheel that's the for first
layer<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:20.600> second<00:01:21.600> layer<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.070> can

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
layer and the second layer or you can

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
layer and the second layer or you can
say<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.409> layer<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> mail

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
say it this the first layer is the mail

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.240 
say it this the first layer is the mail
frame<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> end<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:30.799> second<00:01:31.799> layer<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
frame and the end the second layer is

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.499 
frame and the end the second layer is
the<00:01:32.549> core<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.420> yeah<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> 40<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.509> four

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the core so yeah and the 40 and the four

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
the core so yeah and the 40 and the four
days<00:01:39.689> stands<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> stands<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:43.700> different

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
days stands for the stands for different

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.420 
days stands for the stands for different
material<00:01:46.009> divided<00:01:47.009> wheel<00:01:48.590> dynamic<00:01:50.420> drive<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
material divided wheel dynamic drive and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.830 
material divided wheel dynamic drive and
deep<00:01:53.430> chasm<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:56.270> four<00:01:57.270> words<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
deep chasm so that's the four words of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.319 
deep chasm so that's the four words of
the<00:01:58.170> 40<00:01:58.670> and<00:02:00.590> family<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:02.040> family<00:02:02.670> alone<00:02:03.119> is

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
the 40 and family a family alone is

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.380 
the 40 and family a family alone is
clear<00:02:06.329> real<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.190> almost<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
clear real or I think all almost all the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.740 
clear real or I think all almost all the
for<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.959> system<00:02:10.430> has<00:02:11.430> been<00:02:11.940> reinforced<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
for this system has been reinforced with

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.580 
for this system has been reinforced with
metal

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
metal

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.910 
metal
metal<00:02:14.040> powder<00:02:14.519> if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.319> don't<00:02:16.620> know

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
