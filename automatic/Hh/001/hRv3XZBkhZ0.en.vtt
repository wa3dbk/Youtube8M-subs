00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
package that the color looks more like a

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.020 
package that the color looks more like a
number<00:00:35.670> two<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.130> requested

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
but I'm okay because maybe I need to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
but I'm okay because maybe I need to
lighten<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.690> going

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
lighten it up a little bit so I'm going
