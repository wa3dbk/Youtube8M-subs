now we will fold the final section for

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.780 
now we will fold the final section for
our<00:00:03.419> spinning<00:00:03.990> top<00:00:04.259> starting<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> blitz

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
our spinning top starting with a blitz

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.240 
our spinning top starting with a blitz
base<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.509> are<00:00:06.690> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.140> fold<00:00:07.410> three<00:00:07.859> blitzes

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
base we are going to fold three blitzes

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.749 
base we are going to fold three blitzes
all<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> same<00:00:09.630> side<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> points<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
all on the same side so points to the

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.350 
all on the same side so points to the
center<00:00:12.410> already<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.700> blitz<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
center already we have a one blitz this

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.620 
center already we have a one blitz this
is<00:00:15.540> our<00:00:15.690> second<00:00:16.139> blitz<00:00:16.910> points<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> center

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
is our second blitz points to the center

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.370 
is our second blitz points to the center
and<00:00:23.210> our<00:00:24.210> final<00:00:24.570> blitz<00:00:25.140> our<00:00:25.380> third<00:00:26.010> blitz

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
again points to the center point to the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.950 
again points to the center point to the
center<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:40.129> folding<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.610> unit<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.300> half

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
center and then folding the unit in half

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.910 
center and then folding the unit in half
on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> diagonal<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> get<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.079> guiding

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
on the diagonal you get our guiding

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.840 
on the diagonal you get our guiding
creases<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.860> also<00:00:49.860> fold<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.420> horizontally

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
creases and also fold it horizontally

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.060 
creases and also fold it horizontally
valley-fold<00:00:54.050> horizontally<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> get

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
valley-fold horizontally so that you get

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.830 
valley-fold horizontally so that you get
a<00:00:56.129> nice<00:00:56.690> rectangle<00:00:57.690> open<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
a nice rectangle open it up do a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.479 
a nice rectangle open it up do a
perpendicular<00:01:01.550> horizontal<00:01:02.550> fold<00:01:04.489> dividing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
perpendicular horizontal fold dividing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.039 
perpendicular horizontal fold dividing
the<00:01:05.640> thing<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> half<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:08.119> opening<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the thing in half and opening it so that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.429 
the thing in half and opening it so that
all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.290> blitzes<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> bottom

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
all the blitzes on the are on the bottom

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
all the blitzes on the are on the bottom
we<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:17.330> fold<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we are going to do a fold for a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.969 
we are going to do a fold for a
waterbomb<00:01:20.100> base<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.850> splits<00:01:21.799> that<00:01:22.799> we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
waterbomb base with the splits that we

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.580 
waterbomb base with the splits that we
just<00:01:23.220> did<00:01:24.500> fold<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> creases<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
just did fold the creases in like this

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.460 
just did fold the creases in like this
we<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> water<00:01:32.040> bomb<00:01:32.369> base<00:01:32.420> open<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
we have a water bomb base open it so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.580 
we have a water bomb base open it so
that<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.920> looks<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> nice<00:01:36.740> X<00:01:39.229> now<00:01:40.229> putting

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that it looks like a nice X now putting

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
that it looks like a nice X now putting
the<00:01:41.040> entire<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.759> together<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.140> our

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the entire thing together we have our

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
the entire thing together we have our
first<00:01:45.290> base<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.600> our

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
first base we are going to take our

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.910 
first base we are going to take our
second<00:01:49.229> base<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> taking<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.820> corner

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
second base and taking this corner

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
second base and taking this corner
insert<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> into<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.670> pocket<00:01:54.060> between<00:01:54.960> these

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
insert it into this pocket between these

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.480 
insert it into this pocket between these
two<00:01:55.409> points<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.149> do<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.560> four

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
two points and do that for all four

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.749 
two points and do that for all four
sides<00:02:00.649> insert<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.299> into<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.869> pocket

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.010 

and<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.940> stays<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.509> place<00:02:10.310> taking<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.520> top

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and it stays in place taking this top

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.370 
and it stays in place taking this top
base<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.900> insert<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.960> into

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
base we are just going to insert it into

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.950 
base we are just going to insert it into
these<00:02:16.740> little<00:02:16.830> pockets<00:02:17.570> put<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.720> little

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
these little pockets put the little

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.920 
these little pockets put the little
points<00:02:19.500> into<00:02:20.220> those<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.880> pockets<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
points into those little pockets and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.280 
points into those little pockets and
stays<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.200> place<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.300> now<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:28.020> our

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
stays in place and now we have our

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.250 
stays in place and now we have our
spinning<00:02:29.010> top
