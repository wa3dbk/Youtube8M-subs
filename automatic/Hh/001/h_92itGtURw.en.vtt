00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
similar to that I'm going to use the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.670 
similar to that I'm going to use the
stick<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.319> well<00:02:32.959> after<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.319> something

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
stick as well after you have something

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.619 
stick as well after you have something
looks<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.280> you're<00:02:35.849> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.329> take<00:02:36.599> the

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
looks like this you're going to take the

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.729 
looks like this you're going to take the
birthday<00:02:37.409> packet<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.440> really<00:02:40.620> sure

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
birthday packet and I'm not really sure

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:53.360 
birthday packet and I'm not really sure
what<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.560> mix<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.870> after<00:02:51.989> mixing<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:53.129> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
what is and mix so after mixing this is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330 
what is and mix so after mixing this is
what<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:54.000> came<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.810> think<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.190> our

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
what I have came to I think that our

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.890 
what I have came to I think that our
final<00:02:56.579> step<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.420> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.019> pick<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.560> up

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
final step is just kind of to pick it up

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
final step is just kind of to pick it up
free<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.290> kind<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.709> difficult<00:03:01.920> because

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
free which is kind of difficult because

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.910 
free which is kind of difficult because
it's<00:03:02.819> very<00:03:03.090> sticky<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:04.079> now<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.379> just<00:03:04.739> want

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it's very sticky and now you just want

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.130 
it's very sticky and now you just want
to<00:03:05.670> circle<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.799> guess<00:03:10.730> Tara<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.299> this<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.989> my

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
to circle I guess Tara so this is my

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.319 
to circle I guess Tara so this is my
final<00:03:13.319> comment<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.459> let's<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> taste

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
final comment now let's do the taste

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:28.470 
final comment now let's do the taste
temperature<00:03:15.780> try<00:03:15.989> it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.150
