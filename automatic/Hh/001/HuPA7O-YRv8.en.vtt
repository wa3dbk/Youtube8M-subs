00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.220
 So I can for the application interview 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.989
 really no less rumpled blouse 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.530
 said ironing the must also 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.360
 sit 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.840
 that's why i just want help 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.840
 from my mother 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.600
 So we can just go here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 Stop at all Stop Stopped brought 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.340
 initially with a hoop had to be shot 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.270
 you say that ironing is okay there in 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 each garment to 1 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.390
 every little sign on the shield for one 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.890
 a small prove can be a two 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.670
 his or three points 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.140
 That said that means I can here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 set an iron or white 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 that she does not even get the points 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 to see 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.910
 mauren stoffels and hearing you can use the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 be temperature 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.400
 somehow still something what I now 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.070
 has to pay attention because I'm just stopping 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.390
 A good tip is you can see the people 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 will have recognized that the previously 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.340
 something either with one 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.290
 wet spoken or answer you have 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.759
 a steam iron yes I think so 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 now even something on its own 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.180
 What happens then what do I have to do 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.630
 Do it now because nothing is coming 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.740
 Out 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.110
 legally , only water is here to fill 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.110
 it is probably therefore okay 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.270
 And then that's also the temperature 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.270
 has reached 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.580
