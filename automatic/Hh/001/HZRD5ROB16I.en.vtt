00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
rocks are always the best move in game

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740

so<00:02:04.860> getting<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.969> politoed<00:02:06.329> he<00:02:06.479> does<00:02:06.600> go

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so getting out to politoed he does go

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
so getting out to politoed he does go
for<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> turn<00:02:07.200> oh<00:02:07.380> well<00:02:07.740> big<00:02:07.979> whoop<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.610> he

go to ferrothorn to get my rocks up like
I<00:02:42.420> said<00:02:42.690> which<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.380> what<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.860> he

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
I said which is what I do and he

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.530 
I said which is what I do and he
actually<00:02:44.099> starts<00:02:44.489> laying<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.819> spikes<00:02:45.120> which

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
actually starts laying up spikes which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.710 
actually starts laying up spikes which
is<00:02:45.780> actually<00:02:46.019> really<00:02:46.739> good<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.250> me<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.720> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
is actually really good for me like it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.930 
is actually really good for me like it
it<00:02:49.170> may<00:02:49.769> seem<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.190> weird<00:02:50.310> thing<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.819> say

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
it may seem like a weird thing to say

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.880 
it may seem like a weird thing to say
that<00:02:51.420> him<00:02:51.780> getting<00:02:51.989> up<00:02:52.140> spikes<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.530> good<00:02:52.739> but

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that him getting up spikes is good but

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.289 
that him getting up spikes is good but
that<00:02:53.040> means<00:02:53.220> he<00:02:53.370> won't<00:02:53.580> have<00:02:53.760> stealth<00:02:54.060> rocks

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
that means he won't have stealth rocks

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.880 
that means he won't have stealth rocks
most<00:02:54.540> likely<00:02:54.989> because<00:02:55.110> iron<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.650> three

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
most likely because iron you know three

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.830 
most likely because iron you know three
fourths<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.340> set<00:02:56.610> now<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.000> he'll<00:02:57.480> probably

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
fourths of a set now and he'll probably

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.800 
fourths of a set now and he'll probably
have<00:02:58.140> gyroball<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> huge<00:03:00.360> just

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
have gyroball so that's like a huge just

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.270 
have gyroball so that's like a huge just
weight<00:03:01.019> off<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:01.319> shoulders<00:03:01.680> right<00:03:01.709> there<00:03:02.040> so

situation<00:04:42.120> because<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:42.720> could<00:04:42.870> easily<00:04:42.960> just

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
situation because I could easily just

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.050 
situation because I could easily just
keep<00:04:43.500> traveling<00:04:43.920> him<00:04:44.010> but<00:04:44.190> here<00:04:44.670> i<00:04:44.700> pricked

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
let's just get as much time as possible

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.070 
let's just get as much time as possible
goes<00:05:24.240> at<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.419> glitz<00:05:24.630> course<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:24.900> go<00:05:25.020> to

goes at the glitz course I go to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.750 
goes at the glitz course I go to
tornadoes<00:05:25.650> get<00:05:26.070> another<00:05:26.340> crit<00:05:26.610> with

tornadoes get another crit with
hurricane<00:05:27.180> doubt<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.840> mattered<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.440> because

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
hurricane doubt it mattered just because

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.920 
hurricane doubt it mattered just because
a<00:05:28.650> tornado's<00:05:29.610> well<00:05:30.180> actually<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.540> did<00:05:30.720> run<00:05:30.870> a

a tornado's well actually I did run a
calc<00:05:31.169> two<00:05:31.380> because<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.650> guy<00:05:31.830> was<00:05:31.860> kind<00:05:32.190> of

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
calc two because the guy was kind of

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.690 
calc two because the guy was kind of
bitching<00:05:32.640> about<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:34.100> Randy<00:05:35.100> kelp<00:05:35.310> didn't

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
bitching about it so Randy kelp didn't

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.880 
bitching about it so Randy kelp didn't
matter<00:05:35.820> so<00:05:36.180> whatever<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:37.200> was<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.380> dragonite

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
here kind of random why cuz he could

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.450 
here kind of random why cuz he could
have<00:05:40.320> gone<00:05:40.410> up<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.680> star<00:05:40.950> me<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.220> just<00:05:41.370> out

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
have gone up to star me and just out

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.850 
have gone up to star me and just out
spreading<00:05:41.760> taking<00:05:42.180> me<00:05:42.270> out<00:05:42.450> but<00:05:42.840> he<00:05:43.169> waste<00:05:43.710> is

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.290 
spreading taking me out but he waste is
dragging<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.280> there<00:05:44.460> i<00:05:44.490> go<00:05:44.729> for<00:05:44.910> hurricane

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
dragging it there i go for hurricane

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.760 
dragging it there i go for hurricane
just<00:05:45.570> because<00:05:45.750> i<00:05:45.780> was<00:05:46.140> like<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.470> didn't

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
just because i was like I didn't

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.580 
just because i was like I didn't
remember<00:05:46.890> fight<00:05:47.190> HP<00:05:47.520> ice<00:05:47.669> or<00:05:47.850> not<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:48.590> yeah

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590

whatever<00:05:49.979> anyways<00:05:50.310> he's<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.640> out<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:50.940> his

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
whatever anyways he's going out to his

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.219 
whatever anyways he's going out to his
scissor<00:05:51.450> oh<00:05:51.570> now<00:05:51.720> I'm<00:05:51.780> thinking<00:05:51.930> all<00:05:52.200> right

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
scissor oh now I'm thinking all right

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.659 
scissor oh now I'm thinking all right
let's<00:05:52.500> preserve<00:05:52.770> tornadoes<00:05:53.310> for<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.490> little

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
let's preserve tornadoes for a little

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.520 
let's preserve tornadoes for a little
bit<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:54.000> don't<00:05:54.240> need<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.479> too<00:05:54.600> much<00:05:54.750> but<00:05:55.290> I<00:05:55.380> need

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
bit I don't need it too much but I need

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.170 
bit I don't need it too much but I need
medicos<00:05:55.950> less<00:05:56.310> so<00:05:56.460> let's<00:05:56.610> go<00:05:56.700> to<00:05:56.790> medicos

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
medicos less so let's go to medicos

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.060 
medicos less so let's go to medicos
let's<00:05:57.780> take<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:57.990> bullet<00:05:58.229> punch<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:58.680> know<00:05:58.770> out

because otherwise Dartmouth kind of

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.960 
because otherwise Dartmouth kind of

out<00:07:27.630> speed<00:07:27.930> him<00:07:28.170> so<00:07:28.770> either<00:07:28.920> he's<00:07:29.190> not<00:07:29.370> running

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550
