00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.560
 it's the lion 66 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.170
 let it go guys youtube beauty 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 Let's talk but let's help by bringing more 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.040
 2011 to be all much more well 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 Come to my dear guys in this 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.640
 At this moment I'm going to make a streak here. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 Speedtest is very screwed up with the car. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.949
 new update from lc is dirty money 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 part 27 this time it will be that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.900
 project foresees 20 vetoes our entity 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 because I'm going to do it against people 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.019
 because simply the entity is the car, right? 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.330
 of the four super cases the most 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.440
 fast he ends up being the fastest 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.809
 so I'm here 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 my custom t20 who's me 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 helping once again is the felipe the channel 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 of Felipe will be in the description there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 You sure we go there ready to play 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 here we will not get it turbinated too 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 no kind of advantage are we 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.640
 playing ghost racing and I am 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 playing because the time taken guinado 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 at most because simply the rockstar 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 do not make it so do not forget 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.810
 Felipe is already accelerating the Icarus 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.159
 accelerates earlier in order to avoid any 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 kind of problem not to burn the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.470
 there go 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.870
 sure it has a faster output and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 You can even come and talk to him. 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.260
 I have nothing the guys just have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.640
 faster exit and the issue of 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.320
 that I told him he did not have 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.370
 got up strong here 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.440
 Let's see if he can win. 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.290
 Patients and connected before and it will be cool 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.760
 we see how much he remembers 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 which in my count is that of osiris nerd 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.110
 or that playing a galley race 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 not that statistics are better 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.730
 It hurts 11 they surround and then comes the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 folks we 'll see if the project t 20 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.210
 exceeds our being here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 remembering that we are playing in the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.560
 and this circuit has a bit of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 more than three kilometers and 600 meters 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.930
 so come on 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.490
 oo o in Italy and on the back you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 bacaninha I think it will end 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.020
 catching and passing of final average then the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.600
 How are you going to win this race, let's go? 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.010
 see then avoid the maximum here and stay 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.990
 walking to and fro to make a 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.360
 race as clean as possible to avoid 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 any kind of problem right there 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.870
 because we often make a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.760
 very closed curve very open and this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.269
 end up hampering the performance of our 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.370
 car come right to the entity will not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.020
 I think it's almost four 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.720
 kilometers and can be even faster 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.540
 but in a circuit of 3.6 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 two hundred meters the entity stayed behind 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.160
 then remembering that the entity has already fallen to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.430
 fifth there in the race cars more 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.020
 speed of the whole gta 0 remembering that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.490
 We are in the super category if you 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.660
 liked your book you liked best 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.580
 there is favoritism and the DINERS 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.720
 Anil channel simply that I 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.030
 I was buying more sometimes you 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 also want to test the speedtest ratios 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.020
 will be the link in the description of the look 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 underneath the long pitesti radios and there 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.410
 You'll be able to test with your 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.760
 friends and draw their own conclusions 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.590
 thanks guys until the next strong video 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 I hug a kiss in these hot urns 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.450
 guards I went to
