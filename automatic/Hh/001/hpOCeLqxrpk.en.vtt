they<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> service<00:02:08.459> was

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.850 
they had on it and that the service was
fantastic<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.840> reason<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.319> tend<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.709> stay

away from those smaller older ships like

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.440 
away from those smaller older ships like
that<00:02:13.440> though<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.800> because<00:02:14.000> they're<00:02:15.000> smaller

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that though is because they're smaller

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.350 
that though is because they're smaller
and<00:02:15.900> older<00:02:16.440> they're<00:02:17.190> less<00:02:17.430> activities<00:02:18.150> and

that<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.970> bigger<00:03:12.150> ships<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that I like the bigger ships I like the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.599 
that I like the bigger ships I like the
fact<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.590> there's<00:03:13.799> more<00:03:13.980> activities<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
fact that there's more activities the

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.770 
fact that there's more activities the
pools<00:03:14.819> are<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.060> little<00:03:15.180> bit<00:03:15.329> bigger<00:03:15.540> there's

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
pools are a little bit bigger there's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.020 
pools are a little bit bigger there's
usually<00:03:16.019> more<00:03:16.200> hot<00:03:16.530> tubs<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.640> dining

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
usually more hot tubs and the dining

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.750 
usually more hot tubs and the dining
room<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.720> two<00:03:19.049> stories<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.980> air<00:03:20.130> circulates

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
room is two stories the air circulates

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
room is two stories the air circulates
better<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.359> there's<00:03:21.510> more<00:03:21.720> seating

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
better and there's more seating

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.349 
better and there's more seating
available<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:23.790> less<00:03:23.940> likely<00:03:23.970> to

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
available and and you're less likely to

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.059 
available and and you're less likely to
be<00:03:24.630> sitting<00:03:24.870> at<00:03:25.019> such<00:03:25.170> cramped<00:03:25.590> quarters<00:03:25.829> with

be sitting at such cramped quarters with

be sitting at such cramped quarters with
people<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.609> being<00:03:26.880> said<00:03:27.120> there's<00:03:27.389> nothing

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
people that being said there's nothing

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.270 
people that being said there's nothing
wrong<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.870> those<00:03:28.139> ships<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> lot

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
wrong with those ships I know that a lot

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.580 
wrong with those ships I know that a lot
of<00:03:29.489> people<00:03:29.609> say<00:03:29.970> hey<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> far<00:03:31.380> better

of people say hey we have a far better

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.110 
of people say hey we have a far better
time<00:03:31.950> when<00:03:32.190> we're<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> smaller<00:03:32.760> ships

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
time when we're on the smaller ships

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670 
time when we're on the smaller ships
I've<00:03:33.389> been<00:03:33.600> telling<00:03:33.840> my<00:03:33.900> wife<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.290> years<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I've been telling my wife for years the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.819 
I've been telling my wife for years the
bigger<00:03:34.889> is<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.100> necessarily<00:03:35.220> better<00:03:36.829> but

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
bigger is not necessarily better but

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.190 
bigger is not necessarily better but
with<00:03:37.980> cruise<00:03:38.190> ships<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.880> me<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.780> prefer<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
with cruise ships for me do prefer the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.690 
with cruise ships for me do prefer the
bigger<00:03:40.350> ones<00:03:40.560> another<00:03:41.190> thing<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.579> we<00:03:41.609> always

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
bigger ones another thing that we always

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.610 
bigger ones another thing that we always
consider<00:03:42.480> when<00:03:42.900> we're<00:03:43.049> booking<00:03:43.290> our<00:03:43.350> cruise

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
consider when we're booking our cruise

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.740 
consider when we're booking our cruise
is<00:03:43.799> where<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> leads<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.000> how<00:03:45.150> expensive

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
is where it leads from and how expensive

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.840 
is where it leads from and how expensive
or<00:03:46.139> difficult<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.769> going<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:47.609> to

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
or difficult it's going to be to get to

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.150 
or difficult it's going to be to get to
and<00:03:48.120> return<00:03:48.389> from<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.959> port<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.769> far<00:03:50.010> I've

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and return from the port so far I've

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.039 
and return from the port so far I've
left<00:03:50.400> from<00:03:50.639> Jacksonville<00:03:51.269> Port<00:03:51.690> Canaveral

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
left from Jacksonville Port Canaveral

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.809 
left from Jacksonville Port Canaveral
Fort<00:03:52.590> Lauderdale<00:03:53.100> Miami

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.789 

and<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:56.480> think<00:03:56.659> that's<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.019> also<00:03:57.620> within

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
and I think that's all also within

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.830 
and I think that's all also within
driving<00:03:58.069> distance<00:03:58.280> though<00:03:58.700> would<00:03:58.939> be<00:03:59.060> New

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
driving distance though would be New

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.199 
driving distance though would be New
Orleans<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.560> Tampa<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.310> Charleston<00:04:02.060> and

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
Orleans and Tampa and Charleston and

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.509 
Orleans and Tampa and Charleston and
possibly<00:04:02.749> Norfolk<00:04:03.260> Virginia<00:04:03.499> but<00:04:04.159> for<00:04:04.280> all<00:04:04.400> of

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
possibly Norfolk Virginia but for all of

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.160 
possibly Norfolk Virginia but for all of
our<00:04:04.639> cruises<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:05.180> far<00:04:05.420> we've<00:04:05.629> tried<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.019> leave

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
our cruises so far we've tried to leave

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.569 
our cruises so far we've tried to leave
from<00:04:06.409> somewhere<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.920> was<00:04:07.040> within<00:04:07.249> driving

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
from somewhere that was within driving

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.459 
from somewhere that was within driving
distance<00:04:07.840> everybody's<00:04:08.840> always<00:04:08.989> telling<00:04:09.349> me

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
distance everybody's always telling me

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.589 
distance everybody's always telling me
flying's<00:04:10.010> not<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.489> expensive<00:04:10.849> but<00:04:11.329> whatever

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
flying's not that expensive but whatever

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.530 
flying's not that expensive but whatever
I<00:04:11.659> look<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.260> seems<00:04:12.500> very<00:04:12.969> expensive<00:04:13.969> so<00:04:14.389> much

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
I look it seems very expensive so much

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.089 
I look it seems very expensive so much
so<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.019> adds<00:04:15.200> like<00:04:15.469> six<00:04:15.889> or<00:04:15.980> seven

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
so that it adds like six or seven

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.650 
so that it adds like six or seven
hundred<00:04:16.489> bucks<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.209> price<00:04:17.389> of<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
hundred bucks on to the price of the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.800 
hundred bucks on to the price of the
cruise<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.669> we<00:04:19.669> just<00:04:19.849> haven't<00:04:20.090> done<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.780> far

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
cruise so we just haven't done it so far

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.749 
cruise so we just haven't done it so far
but<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.470> do<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.829> admit<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.190> pretty<00:04:22.520> soon

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
but I do have to admit that pretty soon

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.700 
but I do have to admit that pretty soon
I<00:04:23.060> want<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> go<00:04:23.479> see<00:04:23.750> some<00:04:24.050> other<00:04:24.199> stuff<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
to do some flying but that is something

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.719 
to do some flying but that is something
very<00:04:36.410> important<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.039> consider<00:04:37.400> for<00:04:37.550> instance

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
very important to consider for instance

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.029 
very important to consider for instance
when<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.270> went<00:04:38.449> down<00:04:38.599> to<00:04:38.630> Miami<00:04:39.110> not<00:04:39.680> only<00:04:39.860> was

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
when we went down to Miami not only was

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.279 
when we went down to Miami not only was
it<00:04:40.099> a<00:04:40.250> long<00:04:40.430> drive<00:04:40.759> and<00:04:41.180> you've<00:04:41.660> got<00:04:41.750> gas<00:04:42.050> to

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
it a long drive and you've got gas to

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.969 
it a long drive and you've got gas to
consider<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.860> tolls<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:45.410> tons<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.800> toll

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
consider and tolls the tons of toll

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.310 
consider and tolls the tons of toll
plazas<00:04:46.430> where<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.610> have<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:46.820> pay<00:04:47.050> but<00:04:48.050> you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
plazas where you have to pay but you

that I thoroughly enjoyed them before

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.010 
that I thoroughly enjoyed them before
would<00:05:37.610> be<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.940> distance<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.509> port<00:05:38.840> that

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
would be the distance to the port that

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.810 
would be the distance to the port that
it<00:05:39.139> actually<00:05:39.349> leaves<00:05:39.740> from<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.729> know

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
it actually leaves from so that you know

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.189 
it actually leaves from so that you know
you<00:05:40.909> can<00:05:41.150> calculate<00:05:41.389> all<00:05:41.810> your<00:05:41.960> extra

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
expenses of course number five would

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.430 
expenses of course number five would
probably<00:05:44.120> mean<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.360> duration<00:05:44.900> of<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.229> trip

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
probably mean the duration of the trip

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.930 
probably mean the duration of the trip
