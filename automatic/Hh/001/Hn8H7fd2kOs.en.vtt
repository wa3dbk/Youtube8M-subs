able<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.599> manually<00:00:10.440> tune<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.040> overclock

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
able to manually tune in and overclock

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.769 
able to manually tune in and overclock

going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> find<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.590> how<00:00:29.039> close<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.820> get

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to find out how close you can get

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.749 
going to find out how close you can get
to<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.480> manually<00:00:31.080> tuned<00:00:31.289> overclock<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to my manually tuned overclock by just

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.490 
to my manually tuned overclock by just
pressing<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> button<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.110> MSI

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pressing that button on your MSI

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.889 
pressing that button on your MSI
motherboard<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.750> gonna

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
motherboard so first of all we're gonna

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
motherboard so first of all we're gonna
boot<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.530> I've<00:00:38.340> already<00:00:38.850> set<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.989> hard<00:00:40.950> drive

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
boot up I've already set the hard drive

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
boot up I've already set the hard drive
to<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> HCI<00:00:42.390> mode<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> bile<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.780> hopefully

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to a HCI mode in the bile so hopefully

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.490 
to a HCI mode in the bile so hopefully
that<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.910> still<00:00:47.910> Moses<00:00:48.329> fare<00:00:48.570> OC<00:00:49.020> Genie<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that is still Moses fare OC Genie is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
that is still Moses fare OC Genie is
enabled<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.640> recommended<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> change

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
enabled it's not recommended to change

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
enabled it's not recommended to change
anything<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> BIOS<00:00:52.350> menu<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.980> changing

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
anything in the BIOS menu but changing

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
anything in the BIOS menu but changing
the<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.449> mode<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.260> SATA<00:00:55.559> controller<00:00:56.039> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the the mode of your SATA controller is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130 
the the mode of your SATA controller is
probably<00:00:56.670> still<00:00:57.000> okay<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> go

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
probably still okay so I'm going to go

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.639 
probably still okay so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.579> make<00:00:59.609> sure<00:00:59.760> that

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
ahead and do that just to make sure that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.869 
ahead and do that just to make sure that
what's<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> wrong<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.640> under

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
what's the wrong thing it's under

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
what's the wrong thing it's under
advanced<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.780> under<00:01:04.080> integrated

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
advanced it's under integrated

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
advanced it's under integrated
peripherals<00:01:05.400> yep<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.939> we're<00:01:06.090> still<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.390> HTI

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
peripherals yep so we're still at HTI

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
peripherals yep so we're still at HTI
mode<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.590> didn't<00:01:07.950> reset<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.670> going

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
mode so we didn't reset that I'm going

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
mode so we didn't reset that I'm going
to<00:01:08.880> press<00:01:09.060> f10<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> restart<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> let's<00:01:10.710> find

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
to press f10 and restart and let's find

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.600 
to press f10 and restart and let's find
out<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:12.119> OC<00:01:12.630> Genie<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.229> set<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.830> chip<00:01:14.130> -<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
out what OC Genie has set this chip - so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
out what OC Genie has set this chip - so
we're<00:01:14.820> gonna<00:01:14.909> boot<00:01:15.780> into<00:01:15.960> Windows<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.530> that's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
we're gonna boot into Windows and that's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.830 
we're gonna boot into Windows and that's
probably<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> minute<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
probably going to take a minute or so so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.340 
probably going to take a minute or so so
maybe<00:01:19.200> I'll<00:01:19.380> talk<00:01:19.650> about<00:01:20.780> military<00:01:21.780> class<00:01:22.049> -

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
maybe I'll talk about military class -

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
maybe I'll talk about military class -
while<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.830> wait<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.460> military<00:01:23.909> class<00:01:24.180> -<00:01:24.479> highly

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
while we wait so military class - highly

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
while we wait so military class - highly

ultra<00:01:40.110> long<00:01:40.259> lifetime<00:01:40.939> yeah<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.150> doing

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
ultra long lifetime yeah it's not doing

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.170 
ultra long lifetime yeah it's not doing
anything<00:01:42.570> yet<00:01:42.899> okay<00:01:43.680> camera<00:01:44.549> man's<00:01:44.729> telling

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
anything yet okay camera man's telling

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
anything yet okay camera man's telling
me<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> should<00:01:45.570> pay<00:01:45.689> attention<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> screen

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
me I should pay attention to the screen

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600 
me I should pay attention to the screen
but<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.950> doing<00:01:47.159> anything

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
but it's not doing anything

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
but it's not doing anything
so<00:01:47.850> they're<00:01:48.000> saying<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:49.079> ten<00:01:49.560> plus<00:01:50.040> years

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so they're saying up to ten plus years

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
so they're saying up to ten plus years
of<00:01:50.460> lifetime<00:01:50.729> under<00:01:51.180> full<00:01:51.450> load<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.079> that's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
of lifetime under full load so that's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.289 
of lifetime under full load so that's
assuming<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:52.979> gaming<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.640> 12<00:01:53.909> years

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

wild<00:01:56.430> players<00:01:56.640> could<00:01:56.909> probably<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.350> there

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
wild players could probably do so there

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.590 
wild players could probably do so there
you<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.430> could<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> realistic<00:02:00.060> usage

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you go that could be a realistic usage

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.149 
you go that could be a realistic usage
scenario<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.320> people<00:02:01.590> okay<00:02:01.680> we're<00:02:02.040> boot

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
scenario for some people okay we're boot

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.260 
scenario for some people okay we're boot
it<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.549> Windows<00:02:02.820> yay

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it up into Windows yay

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
it up into Windows yay
okay<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:03.899> I've<00:02:04.409> explained<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> few

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
okay so I've explained this a few

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270 
okay so I've explained this a few
times<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.789> past<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.659> always<00:02:07.129> asks<00:02:08.129> me<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
times in the past it always asks me to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
times in the past it always asks me to
reactivate<00:02:08.910> every<00:02:09.149> time<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> change<00:02:09.629> hardware

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
reactivate every time I change hardware

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290 
reactivate every time I change hardware
so<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> don't<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.590> bother<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.300> activate

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so I don't really bother to activate

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.860 
so I don't really bother to activate
anymore

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
anymore

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.240 
anymore
so<00:02:13.290> what<00:02:13.530> we're<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.800> do<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.069> we're<00:02:14.160> going

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:14.310> lob<00:02:14.489> cpu-z<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:16.560> we're<00:02:16.769> running

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to lob cpu-z and see what we're running

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.369 
to lob cpu-z and see what we're running
at<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> actually<00:02:17.879> have<00:02:18.330> no<00:02:18.720> idea

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
at because I actually have no idea

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.119 
at because I actually have no idea
so<00:02:20.280> at<00:02:20.640> idle<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.660> are<00:02:21.780> running<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.170> 3.5

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
so at idle we are running at 3.5

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.270 
so at idle we are running at 3.5
gigahertz<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.209> that's<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.569> multiplier<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.280> 35

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
gigahertz so that's a multiplier of 35

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.259 
gigahertz so that's a multiplier of 35
with<00:02:27.090> OC<00:02:27.629> GE<00:02:27.959> turned<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:29.090> okay

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
with OC GE turned on okay

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.020 
with OC GE turned on okay
and<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:31.040> let's<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.220> what<00:02:32.370> happens<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.879> we

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and then let's see what happens if we

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.440 
and then let's see what happens if we
run<00:02:33.269> eight<00:02:33.569> threads<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.349> prime95

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.979 

really<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.099> wonder<00:02:41.099> if<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.280> doing<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.640> wrong

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.660 

this<00:02:45.989> really<00:02:46.200> doesn't<00:02:46.440> seem<00:02:46.739> very<00:02:46.769> OCD<00:02:47.130> okay

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
this really doesn't seem very OCD okay

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.490 
this really doesn't seem very OCD okay
gimme<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.000> minute<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.870> find<00:02:49.079> out<00:02:49.230> what

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
gimme a minute and I will find out what

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.539 
gimme a minute and I will find out what
is<00:02:49.709> going<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.500> me<00:02:52.680> actually

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
is going on here so this is me actually

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.830 
is going on here so this is me actually
using<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.450> manual<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.489> I'm<00:02:56.700> gonna<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.299> if

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.339 

that'll<00:03:00.840> tell<00:03:01.200> me<00:03:01.379> anything<00:03:01.650> about<00:03:03.290> how<00:03:04.290> to

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
that'll tell me anything about how to

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.160 
that'll tell me anything about how to
enable<00:03:04.799> OC<00:03:05.430> Genie<00:03:05.700> properly<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.989> far

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
enable OC Genie properly because as far

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.869 
enable OC Genie properly because as far
as<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.470> tell<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.829> haven't<00:03:08.190> done<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.489> right<00:03:08.640> oh

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
as I can tell I haven't done it right oh

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.400 
as I can tell I haven't done it right oh
so<00:03:09.569> there's<00:03:09.750> no<00:03:09.900> CG<00:03:10.290> software<00:03:11.100> application

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
so there's no CG software application

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.660 
so there's no CG software application
okay<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.470> that's<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.950> only<00:03:14.040> thing<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.459> there

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
okay so that's the only thing in there

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.229 
okay so that's the only thing in there
so<00:03:15.209> keep<00:03:16.170> I'll<00:03:16.709> keep<00:03:16.980> checking<00:03:17.340> manuals<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so keep I'll keep checking manuals and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.849 
so keep I'll keep checking manuals and
I'll<00:03:18.359> let<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.569> guys<00:03:18.750> know<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.230> figure<00:03:19.680> anything

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
I'll let you guys know I figure anything

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.390 
I'll let you guys know I figure anything
out<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:22.970> okay<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.030> we're<00:03:24.599> sort<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.370> trying<00:03:26.370> to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
out here okay so we're sort of trying to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
out here okay so we're sort of trying to
figure<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.730> what's<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.329> here<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.660> says

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
figure out what's going on here it says

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.690 
figure out what's going on here it says
here<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.650> disable<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.220> OC<00:03:29.519> Genie

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
here that you can disable the OC Genie

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.940 
here that you can disable the OC Genie
function<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.389> BIOS<00:03:30.690> setup<00:03:30.959> which<00:03:31.829> I

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
function in the BIOS setup which I

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.650 
function in the BIOS setup which I
haven't<00:03:32.190> done<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.849> we're<00:03:33.000> here<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.359> BIOS

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
haven't done so we're here in the BIOS

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.330 
haven't done so we're here in the BIOS
now<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.410> what<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.280> BIOS<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.209> telling<00:03:36.780> me<00:03:37.019> is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
now and what the BIOS is telling me is

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370 
now and what the BIOS is telling me is
that<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.940> are<00:03:38.970> overclocked<00:03:39.930> right<00:03:40.200> now

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
that we are overclocked right now

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.650 
that we are overclocked right now
including<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.190> RAM<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.700> loaded<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.180> XMP

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the CPU voltage it's increased the RAM

the CPU voltage it's increased the RAM
voltage<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.599> theory<00:03:49.049> we're<00:03:49.560> running<00:03:49.889> at

voltage and in theory we're running at

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.490

so<00:03:59.239> while<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.419> sit<00:04:00.750> okay<00:04:01.349> we<00:04:01.709> don't<00:04:01.859> really

so while you sit okay we don't really

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.030 
so while you sit okay we don't really

why<00:04:07.200> don't<00:04:07.260> we<00:04:07.410> set<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.980> enable<00:04:08.130> just<00:04:08.519> in

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
why don't we set that to enable just in

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.280 
why don't we set that to enable just in
case<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.000> makes<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.359> difference<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:09.870> we're

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
case that makes a difference so we're

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.690 
case that makes a difference so we're
going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.470> save<00:04:10.680> our<00:04:10.859> BIOS<00:04:11.190> profile<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.500> reset

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
going to save our BIOS profile and reset

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.170 
going to save our BIOS profile and reset
so<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.909> theory<00:04:15.620> OC<00:04:16.620> Genie<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.250> working

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
so in theory OC Genie is working

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.770 
so in theory OC Genie is working
and<00:04:18.419> we're<00:04:18.870> going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.199> boot<00:04:19.919> up<00:04:20.130> in<00:04:20.600> just<00:04:21.600> a

and we're going to boot up in just a

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.320 
and we're going to boot up in just a
moment<00:04:22.199> so<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.800> was<00:04:23.190> me<00:04:23.370> using<00:04:23.759> a<00:04:23.820> manual

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
never seen it before but there it is so

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.670 
never seen it before but there it is so

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
what are they claiming so they're

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.310 
what are they claiming so they're

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.840 
think that actually works on p67 at
least<00:04:46.139> that's<00:04:46.350> my<00:04:46.470> understanding

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.880 

camera<00:04:57.600> man's<00:04:57.780> like<00:04:58.020> giving<00:04:58.410> me<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.560> funny<00:04:58.800> look

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
camera man's like giving me a funny look

right<00:04:59.220> now<00:04:59.630> I've<00:05:00.630> really<00:05:00.930> run<00:05:01.080> out<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.260> things

right now I've really run out of things

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.220 
right now I've really run out of things
to<00:05:01.710> talk<00:05:01.770> about<00:05:02.510> it's<00:05:03.510> okay<00:05:03.720> though<00:05:03.870> cuz<00:05:04.080> we're

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
to talk about it's okay though cuz we're

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.660 
to talk about it's okay though cuz we're
in<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.410> bassinet<00:05:04.590> or<00:05:05.040> we<00:05:05.310> in<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> bio

screaming<00:05:06.180> guys<00:05:06.300> now<00:05:06.450> okay<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.530> let's<00:05:07.980> fire<00:05:08.160> up

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
screaming guys now okay so let's fire up

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.180 
screaming guys now okay so let's fire up
cpu-z<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.180> see<00:05:09.360> if<00:05:09.450> magically<00:05:10.170> by<00:05:10.560> rebooting

once<00:05:11.660> there<00:05:12.660> okay<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.320> works<00:05:13.530> now<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:15.110> there

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
once there okay it works now so there

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.030 
once there okay it works now so there
you<00:05:16.500> go<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.630> 4.2<00:05:18.630> gigahertz<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.530> what<00:05:19.890> we're

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
you go so 4.2 gigahertz is what we're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.730 
you go so 4.2 gigahertz is what we're

to<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.340> max<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:27.150> now<00:05:27.870> let's<00:05:28.200> see<00:05:28.350> what

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
to the max and now let's see what

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.010 
to the max and now let's see what
happens<00:05:28.950> if<00:05:29.160> we<00:05:29.370> go<00:05:29.520> ahead<00:05:29.640> and<00:05:29.880> do<00:05:30.570> something

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
happens if we go ahead and do something

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.520 
happens if we go ahead and do something
like<00:05:31.050> say<00:05:31.440> for<00:05:31.500> example<00:05:32.310> we<00:05:32.880> run<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.990> tortured
