00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.810 
know Apex Launcher design now I do find
that<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> Apex<00:00:55.920> Launcher<00:00:56.010> doesn't<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:56.670> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that the Apex Launcher doesn't make your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
that the Apex Launcher doesn't make your
Nexus<00:00:57.149> seven<00:00:57.449> smoother<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> hold

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
Nexus seven smoother but when you hold

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
Nexus seven smoother but when you hold
down<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.210> remove<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> edit<00:01:00.960> app

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
down on that you get remove the edit app

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.680 
down on that you get remove the edit app
info<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> share<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.510> that's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
info and share and you know that's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
info and share and you know that's
really<00:01:03.840> helpful<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.390> whatever

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really helpful to you know do whatever

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.359 
really helpful to you know do whatever
you<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> app<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:07.740> resize

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you want to the app you can also resize

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
you want to the app you can also resize
it<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> Apex<00:01:10.080> Launcher<00:01:10.200> does

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it so I think the Apex Launcher does

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
it so I think the Apex Launcher does
make<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> Nexus<00:01:11.430> 7<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.030> smoother<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
make the Nexus 7 a little bit smoother I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
make the Nexus 7 a little bit smoother I
find<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> stock<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.210> launcher

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
find on just the stock you know launcher

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
find on just the stock you know launcher
you<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.680> lag<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you do get some lag and it's kind of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660 
you do get some lag and it's kind of
annoying<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> apex<00:01:18.750> launcher<00:01:19.189> it<00:01:20.189> kind<00:01:20.490> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
annoying so the apex launcher it kind of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
annoying so the apex launcher it kind of
you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> removes<00:01:21.659> some<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.200> lag<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.680> if
