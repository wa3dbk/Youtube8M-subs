you and that fight is figuring out you

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.360 
you and that fight is figuring out you
know<00:05:20.870> how<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.290> exactly<00:05:21.650> breaks<00:05:21.950> down<00:05:22.130> and

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
know how that exactly breaks down and

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.050 
know how that exactly breaks down and
what<00:05:22.520> your<00:05:22.610> best<00:05:22.729> chances<00:05:23.150> are<00:05:23.330> yep

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.300 

the<00:05:27.210> way<00:05:27.720> freedom<00:05:27.990> but<00:05:28.470> he<00:05:28.770> said<00:05:28.950> before<00:05:29.220> you

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the way freedom but he said before you

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.740 
the way freedom but he said before you
think<00:05:29.460> he's<00:05:29.550> somewhat<00:05:29.820> breakable<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:30.419> ya

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
think he's somewhat breakable right ya

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.690 
think he's somewhat breakable right ya
mean<00:05:31.020> his<00:05:31.139> hands<00:05:31.350> his<00:05:31.590> arms<00:05:31.650> seem<00:05:32.460> frazzled

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
mean his hands his arms seem frazzled

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.270 
mean his hands his arms seem frazzled
yeah<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.930> if<00:05:34.260> you<00:05:34.380> think<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.650> accumulation

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
yeah and if you think the accumulation

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.470 
yeah and if you think the accumulation
would<00:05:35.430> maybe<00:05:35.580> break<00:05:35.970> them<00:05:36.090> down<00:05:36.120> in<00:05:36.419> a

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
would maybe break them down in a

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.600 
would maybe break them down in a
situation
