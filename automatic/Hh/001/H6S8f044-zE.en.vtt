00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
 I hope that I can receive more signals so well 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.310
 that does not matter 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.730
 Piper Cheyenne already awake 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 I have discovered the door yet 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.700

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 I am a little careful because it is already dark 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.480
 I think 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480

 all programs a co2online 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.940

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.690
 the worse 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.559
 scans at that time have been the team point 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.149
 a relapse 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.259
 what fails 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 Praunheim 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 not only because of this correct surface 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.339
 it's going to be up 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.819

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.469
 Rank you seem to have weather outside 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.279
 Dr it is raining 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.599

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.990
 no machine noise no bombs 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 I already know that 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.529

 if i think i'm totally done luck 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.610
 maybe I should 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.699
 but sometimes to a bunker 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.699
 Today, you have to search something 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.589
 it is fun 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.309
 as the goal 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.309
 either quiet yesterday 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.259

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.219
 another chapter 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.219
 in the pageant coach that fits 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.249

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.719

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.919
 Aalen 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.919
 legally, I believe 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.409
 to spend such action 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.189
 either 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.189
 legally not jux stones 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.710
 no more no less spawning 

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.149
 m 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:39.149
 both locations will be 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.490
 Scheuch why 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.580
 to prepare such immense ones above for sleep 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.550
 and create a signal for everyone through the lack of listening 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:57.719
 not important with Re 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.219
 not otherwise 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.029
