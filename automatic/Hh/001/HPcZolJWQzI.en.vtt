building the front bumper of the vehicle

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.320 
building the front bumper of the vehicle
at<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> moment<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.950> lot<00:03:03.520> more<00:03:03.730> aggressive<00:03:04.240> than

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
at the moment a lot more aggressive than

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.690 
at the moment a lot more aggressive than
the<00:03:04.390> factory<00:03:04.810> trim<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.680> vehicle<00:03:06.100> you've

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the factory trim of the vehicle you've

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640 
the factory trim of the vehicle you've
got<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.210> fog<00:03:07.480> lights<00:03:07.750> instead<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.200> one<00:03:08.410> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
got to fog lights instead of one and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.220 
got to fog lights instead of one and
then<00:03:09.400> new<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.970> new<00:03:10.120> feature<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.990> on<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
then new a new feature on the on the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.260 
then new a new feature on the on the
newer<00:03:11.470> models<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.010> an<00:03:12.130> LED<00:03:12.550> strip<00:03:12.880> which<00:03:13.120> is

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
newer models is an LED strip which is

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.790 
newer models is an LED strip which is
going<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.450> go<00:03:13.630> right<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.200> area<00:03:14.380> we

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
going to go right here in this area we

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.550 
going to go right here in this area we
have<00:03:14.950> engine<00:03:15.370> conversions<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.060> vehicle

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
have engine conversions for this vehicle

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.440 
have engine conversions for this vehicle
stroked<00:03:17.560> motors<00:03:17.980> meaning<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.430> increased<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
stroked motors meaning we increased the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.850 
stroked motors meaning we increased the
displacement<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.260> motor<00:03:21.120> twin

turbochargers<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.340> motor<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:25.390> quite<00:03:26.020> a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
turbochargers for this motor is quite a

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.200 
turbochargers for this motor is quite a
bit<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.290> things<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.830> do<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.910> then

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
bit of things that we can do and then

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
that true well I think it's because we

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.390 
that true well I think it's because we
have<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.420> access<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.350> products<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:41.920> are

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
have the access to the products that are

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.630 
worldwide so we're able to bring in
because<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> size<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.920> our<00:03:51.040> market<00:03:51.490> we're

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640
