00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.240 
make it easier for a future reference if
you<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.060> area<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.260> h1<00:03:23.070> you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
you have this area you know is h1 you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.310 
you have this area you know is h1 you
could<00:03:23.400> select<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.330> like<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.260> just

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
could select it like this like I just

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.199 
could select it like this like I just
did<00:03:26.780> boom<00:03:27.780> loop<00:03:28.140> region<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.310> hit<00:03:29.489> R<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:30.150> the

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
did boom loop region we can hit R on the

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.070 
did boom loop region we can hit R on the
keyboard<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:32.100> type<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.489> h1<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.810> section

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
keyboard and type in h1 now this section

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.320 
keyboard and type in h1 now this section
is<00:03:34.350> named<00:03:34.590> h1<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> need<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.940> go<00:03:36.090> back

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
is named h1 so if you need to go back

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.570 
is named h1 so if you need to go back
you<00:03:36.989> can<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.410> exactly<00:03:37.920> which<00:03:38.130> part<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
you can know exactly which part of the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.090 
you can know exactly which part of the
timeline<00:03:39.060> goes<00:03:39.630> into<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.110> media<00:03:40.500> bin<00:03:40.709> so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
timeline goes into that media bin so

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.640 
timeline goes into that media bin so
that's<00:03:41.610> helpful<00:03:41.850> advice<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.200> said<00:03:43.470> on

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
that's helpful advice and like I said on

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.120 
that's helpful advice and like I said on
my<00:03:43.760> workflow<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.000> do<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> piece<00:03:46.380> at<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> time<00:03:46.650> so

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
my workflow I do it a piece at a time so

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.670 
my workflow I do it a piece at a time so
I'd<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.459> done<00:03:47.610> with<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.540> maybe<00:03:48.840> there's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
I'd be done with this now maybe there's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.320 
I'd be done with this now maybe there's
a<00:03:49.769> shot<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.519> something<00:03:50.670> else<00:03:50.910> I'm<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.239> to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
a shot of something else I'm going to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.990 
a shot of something else I'm going to
gmod<00:03:51.660> record<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.320> bring<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.400> back<00:03:53.549> here<00:03:53.790> add

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
gmod record that bring it back here add

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.789 
gmod record that bring it back here add
it<00:03:54.030> onto<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.540> timeline<00:03:54.780> add<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.470> into<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
it onto the timeline add it into the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.190 
it onto the timeline add it into the
video<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.340> like<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.390> video<00:03:57.630> progress<00:03:58.049> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
video I like to see my video progress I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.199 
video I like to see my video progress I
like<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.500> think<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.890> as<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.190> goes<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.700> adapt

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
like to think of it as it goes and adapt

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.400 
like to think of it as it goes and adapt
and<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:00.959> what<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.140> do

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
and that's what I do

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.350 
and that's what I do
so<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.519> do<00:04:02.670> something<00:04:02.970> differently

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
so if you do something differently

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.789 
so if you do something differently
something<00:04:04.019> better<00:04:04.230> let<00:04:04.470> me<00:04:04.560> know<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.769> the

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
something better let me know in the

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.070 
something better let me know in the
comments<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.640> learn<00:04:05.880> I'm<00:04:06.720> not<00:04:07.049> a
