00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that back there too but it's a little

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.020 
that back there too but it's a little
bit<00:00:40.260> more<00:00:42.079> you're<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.200> banging<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.370> whole

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.729 

core<00:00:48.860> bones<00:00:50.210> probably<00:00:51.210> I'll<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> watching<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
core bones probably I'll be watching a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.020 
core bones probably I'll be watching a
traffic<00:00:53.160> accident<00:00:53.309> will<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.850> more

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
traffic accident will be more

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:33.510 
traffic accident will be more
interesting

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:02:17.180 

interesting<00:01:34.520> here

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580

and I'm going to show you how to
eliminate<00:03:29.069> these<00:03:30.069> lines<00:03:30.549> here<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:32.370> these

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
eliminate these lines here so and these

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.720 
eliminate these lines here so and these
use<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:36.180> lightweight<00:03:37.180> spackling<00:03:37.599> and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
use is this lightweight spackling and

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.520 
use is this lightweight spackling and
right<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:39.940> I'm<00:03:40.180> kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.599> it's<00:03:41.169> it's<00:03:41.410> a

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
right now I'm kind of it's it's a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.960 
right now I'm kind of it's it's a
toss-up<00:03:41.950> for<00:03:42.010> me<00:03:42.220> whether<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:43.349> do<00:03:44.349> it

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
toss-up for me whether to do it

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.849 
toss-up for me whether to do it
put<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> spackling<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.720> before<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.230> put<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
put the spackling on before I put the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.009 
put the spackling on before I put the
base<00:03:48.040> coat<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.549> or<00:03:48.880> put<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.060> base<00:03:49.299> going<00:03:49.569> on<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
base coat on or put a base going on and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.089 
base coat on or put a base going on and
then<00:03:50.139> spackle<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.799> because<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.160> advantage<00:03:51.639> of

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
then spackle it because the advantage of

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.680 
then spackle it because the advantage of
spackling<00:03:54.099> a<00:03:54.190> little<00:03:54.400> bit<00:03:54.489> afterwards

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
spackling a little bit afterwards

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.530 
spackling a little bit afterwards
at<00:03:57.200> least<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.500> feel<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.940> lines

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
at least I feel I can see the lines

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.010 
at least I feel I can see the lines
better<00:03:59.930> where<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:02.360> know<00:04:02.480> becomes<00:04:02.810> more

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
better where you know becomes more

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.820 
better where you know becomes more
obvious<00:04:04.600> where<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.720> lines<00:04:05.960> are<00:04:06.200> after<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.590> put

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
obvious where the lines are after I put

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.290 
obvious where the lines are after I put
the<00:04:06.920> base<00:04:07.100> coat<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.580> sometimes<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> base

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
the base coat and sometimes the base

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.470 
the base coat and sometimes the base
coat<00:04:08.600> will<00:04:09.040> cover<00:04:10.040> things<00:04:10.280> up<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.000> I'm<00:04:11.300> only

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
coat will cover things up so I'm only

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.560 
coat will cover things up so I'm only
putting<00:04:11.720> spackle<00:04:12.710> where<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:13.640> absolutely<00:04:14.180> need

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
putting spackle where I absolutely need

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.020 
putting spackle where I absolutely need
to<00:04:14.720> have<00:04:14.960> it<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:17.560> anyway<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.860> we'll<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:19.880> ahead

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
to have it so anyway and we'll go ahead

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.870 
to have it so anyway and we'll go ahead
and<00:04:20.269> get<00:04:20.690> started
