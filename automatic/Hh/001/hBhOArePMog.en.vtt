00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so good with the tx9 and TX 10 I figured

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.470 
so good with the tx9 and TX 10 I figured
what<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.469> bad<00:00:34.739> about<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.239> price

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
what you be so bad about this the price

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
what you be so bad about this the price
feels<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.020> lot<00:00:37.230> less<00:00:37.530> knife<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.190> figured<00:00:38.610> maybe<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
feels a lot less knife I figured maybe I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
feels a lot less knife I figured maybe I
was<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> wasn't<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.989> designed<00:00:40.829> like

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
was because it wasn't like designed like

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.680 
was because it wasn't like designed like
the<00:00:41.190> T<00:00:41.430> theories<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.059> anything<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.950> don't<00:00:43.950> know

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
the T theories or anything I don't know

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.850 
the T theories or anything I don't know
but<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.200> could<00:00:46.440> tell<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.829> thing

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
but I think I could tell you one thing

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
but I think I could tell you one thing
about<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.340> camera<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.719> reason<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.200> hate<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
about this camera the reason I hate it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.939 
about this camera the reason I hate it
is<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.750> when<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.870> got<00:00:52.140> rid<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> canon

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
is because when I got rid of the canon

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
is because when I got rid of the canon
powershot<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.879> got<00:00:54.449> rid<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.260> was

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
powershot I got rid of it because it was

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.490 
powershot I got rid of it because it was
a<00:00:55.379> fixed<00:00:55.800> focus<00:00:56.219> camera<00:00:56.550> during<00:00:57.230> movie<00:00:58.230> mode

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
a fixed focus camera during movie mode

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
a fixed focus camera during movie mode
and<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.690> improvement<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and this really was an improvement this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
and this really was an improvement this
one<00:01:06.020> because<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.450> fixed<00:01:09.900> focus<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
one because it's not fixed focus but it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.810 
one because it's not fixed focus but it
takes<00:01:11.299> 10<00:01:12.299> seconds<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.140> average<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:14.280> focus<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
takes 10 seconds on average to focus on

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
takes 10 seconds on average to focus on
anything<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.810> holding<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
anything you have to be holding the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.370 
anything you have to be holding the
camera<00:01:16.560> perfectly<00:01:16.950> still<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
camera perfectly still for it to do that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.200 
camera perfectly still for it to do that
the<00:01:19.799> w<00:01:20.220> 290<00:01:20.759> never<00:01:21.000> gave<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.600> problem<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the w 290 never gave me this problem and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.999 
the w 290 never gave me this problem and
it<00:01:24.210> would<00:01:24.450> always<00:01:24.630> focus<00:01:25.200> properly<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.950> they

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it would always focus properly and they

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.240 
it would always focus properly and they
would<00:01:26.189> never<00:01:26.780> have<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.470> never<00:01:28.979> had<00:01:29.130> any

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
