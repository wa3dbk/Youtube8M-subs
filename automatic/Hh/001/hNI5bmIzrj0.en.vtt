00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.310 
on this channel and I'll be showing you
my<00:00:09.969> advanced<00:00:10.389> sliding<00:00:10.900> door<00:00:13.019> I'm<00:00:14.019> just<00:00:14.169> gonna

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
my advanced sliding door I'm just gonna

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.199 
my advanced sliding door I'm just gonna
start<00:00:14.499> off<00:00:14.619> by<00:00:14.679> saying<00:00:15.009> this<00:00:15.249> isn't<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:16.030> much

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
start off by saying this isn't that much

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.780 
start off by saying this isn't that much
different<00:00:16.720> than<00:00:16.780> a<00:00:16.900> regular<00:00:16.960> door<00:00:17.790> although

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
different than a regular door although

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.360 
different than a regular door although
it<00:00:19.630> gives<00:00:19.870> a<00:00:20.050> better<00:00:20.230> feel<00:00:20.650> I<00:00:20.980> would<00:00:21.910> say

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
it gives a better feel I would say

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.670 
it gives a better feel I would say
you'll<00:00:24.370> definitely<00:00:24.940> be<00:00:25.090> able<00:00:25.120> to<00:00:25.330> tell

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
you'll definitely be able to tell

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.610 
you'll definitely be able to tell
because<00:00:26.730> instead<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:27.790> just<00:00:28.000> pushing<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:29.380> and

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:29.620 
because instead of just pushing out and

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.890 
because instead of just pushing out and
this<00:00:30.220> is<00:00:30.280> not<00:00:30.610> fully<00:00:31.090> complete<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.660> can<00:00:31.690> make

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
this is not fully complete you can make

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.120 
this is not fully complete you can make
it<00:00:32.020> look<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.230> lot<00:00:32.349> better<00:00:32.590> but<00:00:33.460> there<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.879> no<00:00:35.130> red

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
it look a lot better but there is no red

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.200 
it look a lot better but there is no red
button<00:00:36.490> on<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> side<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:39.490> does<00:00:39.790> I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
button on the side and so it does I

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.910 
button on the side and so it does I
think<00:00:40.540> look<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.380> lot<00:00:41.560> better

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
think look a lot better

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.979 
think look a lot better
and<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.970> can<00:00:43.150> make<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.450> button<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.750> little

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
and you can make the button a little

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.319 
and you can make the button a little
more<00:00:44.110> obvious<00:00:44.500> if<00:00:44.890> you'd<00:00:45.520> like<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
more obvious if you'd like but you

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.380 
more obvious if you'd like but you
actually<00:00:49.510> use<00:00:49.810> the<00:00:49.930> computer<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:51.250> this<00:00:52.210> will

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
actually use the computer and this will

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually use the computer and this will
definitely<00:00:52.950> change<00:00:53.950> how<00:00:54.220> zombies<00:00:54.430> feel<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
definitely change how zombies feel the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.440 
definitely change how zombies feel the
game<00:00:57.010> type<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.910> will<00:01:01.090> really<00:01:01.149> help

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
game type I think this will really help

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.049 
game type I think this will really help
because<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:03.130> gives<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.460> that<00:01:03.489> feel<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.820> having

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
because it gives you that feel of having

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.120 
because it gives you that feel of having
to<00:01:04.329> do<00:01:04.479> something<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:06.460> think<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.979> is

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
to do something and I think that this is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.430 
to do something and I think that this is
gonna<00:01:09.310> be<00:01:09.400> really<00:01:09.850> good<00:01:10.090> for<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:11.080> foraging

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
gonna be really good for the foraging

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.039 
gonna be really good for the foraging
committee<00:01:11.799> even<00:01:12.790> though<00:01:13.090> I'm<00:01:13.600> not<00:01:13.870> really

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
committee even though I'm not really

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.130 
committee even though I'm not really
part<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.620> I<00:01:14.770> just<00:01:15.720> came<00:01:16.720> up<00:01:16.780> with<00:01:17.020> some

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
part of it I just came up with some

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.240 
part of it I just came up with some
ideas<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.790> probably<00:01:18.940> gonna<00:01:19.119> share

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
ideas and I'm probably gonna share

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.030 
ideas and I'm probably gonna share
throughout<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.430> channel<00:01:22.260> but<00:01:23.260> as<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.920> can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
throughout this channel but as you can

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.830 
throughout this channel but as you can
see<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:25.240> says<00:01:25.750> build<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.710> turrets<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.850> it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
see it says build the turrets and it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.460 
see it says build the turrets and it
will<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> little<00:01:29.680> loading<00:01:30.159> interface<00:01:30.760> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
will have a little loading interface and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.399 
will have a little loading interface and
you<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.500> hear<00:01:32.740> some<00:01:32.890> mechanics<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.610> off

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you can hear some mechanics going off

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.830 
you can hear some mechanics going off
and<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:36.220> think<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:36.640> really<00:01:36.850> helps

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
and I think this really helps

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
and I think this really helps
just<00:01:40.159> keep<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.280> saying<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> really

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just keep on saying this but it really

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
just keep on saying this but it really
helps<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> field<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.189> would

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
helps the field and I think it would

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.560 
helps the field and I think it would
look<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.299> lot<00:01:45.450> better<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.469> space<00:01:46.860> maps

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
look a lot better and like space maps

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
look a lot better and like space maps
you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.600> change<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.500> special<00:01:50.310> effects<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you can change the special effects and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
you can change the special effects and
make<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.329> look<00:01:51.420> darker<00:01:52.759> but<00:01:54.860> right<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.100> was

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
make it look darker but right here I was

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.630 
make it look darker but right here I was
I<00:01:57.530> wasn't<00:01:58.530> sure<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> little

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I wasn't sure if I like that little

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
I wasn't sure if I like that little
riggidy<00:02:00.030> part<00:02:00.390> however<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:01.170> did<00:02:01.319> put<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> lot

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
riggidy part however they did put a lot

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.590 
riggidy part however they did put a lot
of<00:02:01.710> detail<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
of detail into it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.839 
of detail into it
but<00:02:04.819> you<00:02:05.819> can<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.829> many<00:02:07.829> other<00:02:08.069> ways<00:02:08.310> I'll

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
but you can do this many other ways I'll

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.839 
but you can do this many other ways I'll
show<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> how<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.049> here

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
show you how to do it right here

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.250 
show you how to do it right here
and<00:02:11.849> keep<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.090> mind<00:02:12.299> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.569> make<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and keep in mind you can make it go a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.780 
and keep in mind you can make it go a
little<00:02:13.440> faster<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.400> want<00:02:16.790> you'll

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
little faster if you want you'll

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
little faster if you want you'll
probably<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.269> able<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.630> tell<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.200> how<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.410> says

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
probably be able to tell see how it says

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.870 
probably be able to tell see how it says
charging<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.610> you'll<00:02:20.760> probably

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
charging right here but you'll probably

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
charging right here but you'll probably
be<00:02:21.150> able<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.360> tell<00:02:23.060> how<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> build<00:02:24.480> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
be able to tell how to build it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.490 
be able to tell how to build it
but<00:02:25.519> you<00:02:26.519> can't<00:02:26.819> ask<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.569> me<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.319> do<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
but you can't ask for me to do a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.059 
but you can't ask for me to do a
tutorial<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.459> guys<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.090> want<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:31.069> it's

tutorial if you guys really want to it's
a<00:02:32.190> pretty<00:02:32.370> easy<00:02:32.579> setup<00:02:32.940> you'll<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.260> see

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
a pretty easy setup you'll you can see

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.460 
a pretty easy setup you'll you can see
it<00:02:34.590> all<00:02:34.709> right<00:02:34.739> here<00:02:36.079> that's<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.200> food<00:02:37.319> in

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it all right here that's the food in

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.390 
it all right here that's the food in
coil<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:39.799> chain<00:02:40.799> reaction<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
coil and this is the chain reaction to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.819 
coil and this is the chain reaction to
it<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.819> that's<00:02:42.180> basically<00:02:42.530> what's<00:02:43.530> holding

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
it and that's basically what's holding

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.879 
it and that's basically what's holding
it<00:02:43.889> up<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:47.150> I'll<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.209> show<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.690> from

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
it up but I'll just show you from

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.319 
it up but I'll just show you from
there's<00:02:49.889> a<00:02:50.040> radius<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.609> here<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.180> what

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
there's a radius right here that's what

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.789 
there's a radius right here that's what
I<00:02:51.389> was<00:02:51.709> trying<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.739> say<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.930> made<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
I was trying to say but you I made it a

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.759 
I was trying to say but you I made it a
little<00:02:56.430> bit<00:02:56.549> behind<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.030> wall<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.590> can

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
little bit behind the wall so you can

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
little bit behind the wall so you can
actually<00:02:59.150> have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.299> get<00:03:00.450> next<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
actually have to get next to the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.640 
actually have to get next to the
computer<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.500> try<00:03:01.859> it<00:03:01.920> out<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.530> like

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
computer to try it out and it's like

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
computer to try it out and it's like

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.640 

I<00:03:07.579> just<00:03:08.579> forgot<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.720> swings<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.900> blows

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
I just forgot but it swings and it blows

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.260 
I just forgot but it swings and it blows
it<00:03:13.799> up<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
it up and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.110 
it up and
it's<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> pretty<00:03:15.840> basic<00:03:16.080> sliding<00:03:16.890> door<00:03:17.120> except

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
it's a pretty basic sliding door except

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.020 
it's a pretty basic sliding door except
it<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:20.570> I'm<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.810> sure<00:03:22.050> if<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:23.130> would<00:03:23.250> just

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
it just I'm not sure if it would just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.190 
it just I'm not sure if it would just
change<00:03:25.610> how<00:03:26.610> we<00:03:26.670> play<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:28.310> could<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.670> this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
change how we play I could see this

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.780 
change how we play I could see this
definitely<00:03:31.200> beginning<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> broken

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
definitely beginning of like a broken

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.710 
definitely beginning of like a broken

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
ship space map like a flashing light or

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.780 
ship space map like a flashing light or
something<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.530> everyone<00:03:38.250> starts<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.670> this

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
something and everyone starts in this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.200 
something and everyone starts in this
small<00:03:39.060> room<00:03:39.680> with<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.060> says

charging<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.990> can<00:03:43.440> definitely<00:03:43.590> see<00:03:44.010> how<00:03:44.100> that'd

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
charging I can definitely see how that'd

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.690 
charging I can definitely see how that'd
be<00:03:44.430> pretty<00:03:44.580> cool<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:47.220> does<00:03:47.460> take<00:03:47.670> some

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
be pretty cool and it does take some

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.760 
be pretty cool and it does take some
time<00:03:47.880> again<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.020> make<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.230> faster<00:03:49.410> if

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
time again you can make it faster if

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.510 
time again you can make it faster if
you'd<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.930> but<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.910> mean<00:03:54.440> I'm<00:03:55.440> I'd<00:03:56.010> really

maps<00:03:59.480> hopefully<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:01.080> guys<00:04:01.200> can<00:04:01.440> try<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.680> out

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
maps hopefully you guys can try it out

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.090 
maps hopefully you guys can try it out
peace<00:04:02.880> out
