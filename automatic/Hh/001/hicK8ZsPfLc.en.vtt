00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.250
 do you need more diverse by 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.060
 cold weather when there is no snow 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.309
 on the road 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.170
 is the summer more in any season 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 really behaves differently than 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.330
 more diverse at more temperatures 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.719
 cold 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 let's take a look it's summer and the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.939
 temperature is 24 degrees centigrade 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.859
 in the frame of the top the blue car 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.990
 all-season tires and in the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.840
 bottom frame the white car 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 a wine inmate if we take a view 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.060
 close to the contact of the most with the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 road 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 we see that at this temperature 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 relatively hot the compound of the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 sale of tire bearing all 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.129
 seasons and souks and adapts to the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 pavement this has a positive impact on 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.559
 the acceleration characteristics of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 maneuverability and braking the most 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.750
 various are designed for performance 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.910
 optimal in cold weather and its side or 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 at this temperature that the screeds of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.770
 tread are deformed under the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 charge of the car the compounds of the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.609
 tread of winter tires 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 Judge faster than tires 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.200
 summer or all-season tires in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 summer temperatures and are in fact 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.229
 so soft and supple as the maneuverability and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.119
 braking are negatively affected 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.549
 so what happens when the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.310
 temperature drops here the temperature 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.890
 is 7 degrees centigrade in the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 jo frame the car is still equipped 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 of all-season tires and the car of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 bench with more wine when we 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 look at the contact of the most with the road 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.409
 we see that all season outfit 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 is still consistent with the road but 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.180
 less than in more temperatures 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.460
 hot looking at the contact more 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.649
 various we still find that the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 compound tread is flexible 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.390
 at this colder temperature but the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
 make up and is no longer as safe where he 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.880
 negatively affects the wear the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.189
 maneuverability and braking 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.649
 now the temperature has dropped to 0 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.509
 degrees centigrade 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.360
 the all-season tires became no 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.920
 flexible or rigid looking at the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.049
 contact more with the road 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.929
 we see that the band compound 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.719
 is so redacted 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.439
 it does not conform to the roadway 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.750
 obviously 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.900
 the attraction will be considerably 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.120
 reduced from is this so when looking at the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.280
 more diverse with a compound of bands of 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 rolling designed for this killer ampera 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.139
 it is not surprising that we see 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.560
 excellent contact between the tire and the 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.950
 road 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.519
 maneuverability and braking remains at a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.680
 high level of performance so the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.099
 more diverse are not just for 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.129
 the snow 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.470
 the maneuverability and performance of 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.569
 low temperature braking is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.950
 significantly improved with tires 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.930
 winter 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.930
 the question you need to answer is 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.510
 the next one do you really need to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.530
 best performance well this is at 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.530
 you answer them
