the trials he turns into venom goes nuts

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.160 
the trials he turns into venom goes nuts
or<00:01:55.439> something<00:01:55.590> gets<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.790> right

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
or something gets out of there right

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
then they're like okay listen we've

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
then they're like okay listen we've
created<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.180> new<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.649> it's<00:02:01.649> more<00:02:01.950> controlled

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
created a new one it's more controlled

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.580 
created a new one it's more controlled
and<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.240> should<00:02:03.420> work<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.750> time<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.170> then

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and it should work this time and then

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.139 
and it should work this time and then
you<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.829> carnage<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.790> well<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.060> would

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
you get carnage you know well it would
be<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.420> weird<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.530> just

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
be a little weird because this is just

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
be a little weird because this is just
me<00:02:07.799> taking<00:02:08.039> shots<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.429> dark<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.849> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
me taking shots in the dark really I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.119 
me taking shots in the dark really I
don't<00:02:09.119> expect<00:02:09.569> any<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.259> true<00:02:10.530> but

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
don't expect any of this to be true but

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't expect any of this to be true but
well<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.180> bit<00:02:12.270> weird

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
well it would be a little bit weird

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.580 
well it would be a little bit weird
is<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:14.420> coincidental<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.050> both

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
is that it be so coincidental that both

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.590 
is that it be so coincidental that both
trials<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:18.230> know<00:02:18.320> go<00:02:18.350> crazy<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.100> anyways
