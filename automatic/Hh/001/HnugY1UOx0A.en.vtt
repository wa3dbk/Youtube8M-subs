00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
tire which is very interesting the way

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.009 
tire which is very interesting the way
they<00:03:34.920> mounted<00:03:35.430> Plymouth<00:03:35.880> was<00:03:36.060> using<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:36.989> a

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
they mounted Plymouth was using it as a

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.069 
they mounted Plymouth was using it as a
marketing<00:03:38.000> technique<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.299> sell<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.720> women

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
marketing technique to sell it to women

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.170 
marketing technique to sell it to women
and<00:03:40.230> they<00:03:40.980> figured<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.579> didn't<00:03:41.820> mount<00:03:41.940> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
and they figured if they didn't mount it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.180 
and they figured if they didn't mount it
on<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.420> rear<00:03:42.630> like<00:03:43.109> most<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> Fords<00:03:43.980> did

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
on the rear like most of the Fords did

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.610 
on the rear like most of the Fords did
at<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> time<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:45.750> would<00:03:45.930> make<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.260> more<00:03:46.440> of

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
at that time this would make it more of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.360 
at that time this would make it more of
a<00:03:47.630> family<00:03:48.630> car<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.230> opposed<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.709> utilitarian

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
a family car as opposed to a utilitarian

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.750 
a family car as opposed to a utilitarian
car<00:03:52.370> yeah<00:03:53.480> all<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.780> gauges<00:03:54.959> work<00:03:55.760> everything

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
car yeah all the gauges work everything
