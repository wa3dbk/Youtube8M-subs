00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
you can just do it to the degree to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.450 
you can just do it to the degree to
which<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.730> want<00:01:05.000> your<00:01:05.120> blood<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.900> be<00:01:06.050> red<00:01:06.410> so<00:01:06.710> I

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
which you want your blood to be red so I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.220 
which you want your blood to be red so I
just<00:01:07.760> use<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.000> chocolate<00:01:08.690> sauce<00:01:08.900> for<00:01:09.200> a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
just use the chocolate sauce for a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.870 
just use the chocolate sauce for a
little<00:01:09.470> bit<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.710> flavoring<00:01:10.160> you<00:01:10.370> can<00:01:10.550> do<00:01:10.700> it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
little bit of flavoring you can do it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.430 
little bit of flavoring you can do it
without<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.510> chocolate<00:01:11.690> sauce<00:01:12.080> if<00:01:12.320> you

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
without the chocolate sauce if you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.590 
without the chocolate sauce if you
prefer<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.610> think<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.180> adds<00:01:14.360> a

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
prefer I just think that it adds a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.650 
prefer I just think that it adds a
little<00:01:14.750> bit<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.460> corn<00:01:16.730> syrup<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.450> gives

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
little bit to the corn syrup just gives

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.720 
little bit to the corn syrup just gives
it<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.900> bit<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.100> better<00:01:19.250> flavor<00:01:19.610> than

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
it a bit of a but better flavor than

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.700 
it a bit of a but better flavor than
just<00:01:19.910> pure<00:01:20.690> sugar<00:01:21.170> rush

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
