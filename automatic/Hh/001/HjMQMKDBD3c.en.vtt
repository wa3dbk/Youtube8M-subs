00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
100 chemistry usually I have you guys

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.320 
100 chemistry usually I have you guys
build<00:00:14.070> teams<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.490> me<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.849> Q<00:00:15.120> squad

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
build teams for me but the Q squad

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.490 
build teams for me but the Q squad
nobody<00:00:15.660> could<00:00:15.809> build<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
nobody could build one that was like a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.810 
nobody could build one that was like a
full<00:00:16.740> squad<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> looked<00:00:17.400> through<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> bunch<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
full squad I looked through a bunch of

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
full squad I looked through a bunch of
links<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> decided<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> let<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> stream

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
links and so I decided to let the stream

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.200 
links and so I decided to let the stream
help<00:00:19.920> me<00:00:20.070> build<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.550> lot<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.820> different<00:00:21.060> ones

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
help me build a lot of different ones

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.500 
help me build a lot of different ones
and<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:22.140> did<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.920> anywhere<00:00:23.310> close<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:24.150> 100

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and it did not get anywhere close to 100

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.660 
and it did not get anywhere close to 100
chemistry<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.960> actually<00:00:25.320> get<00:00:25.500> 37<00:00:26.130> chemistry

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
chemistry to actually get 37 chemistry

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
chemistry to actually get 37 chemistry
which<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.380> we're<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> go

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
which is for it but we're going to go

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.779 
which is for it but we're going to go
ahead<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.859> take<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> look<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> team<00:00:29.609> right

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
ahead and take a look at the team right

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.229 
ahead and take a look at the team right
now<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.869> 4<00:00:31.140> 12<00:00:31.619> 12<00:00:32.219> m<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.000> yeah<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
now it's in a 4 12 12 m and yeah it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.400 
now it's in a 4 12 12 m and yeah it's
probably<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> worst<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.079> ever<00:00:34.110> build

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
probably be the worst one we ever build

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
probably be the worst one we ever build
maybe<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.800> don't<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.489> squad<00:00:35.969> might

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
maybe I don't know the you squad might

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
maybe I don't know the you squad might
be<00:00:36.300> bad<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.660> well<00:00:36.809> we'll<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.760> left

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
be bad as well we'll see so in the left

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.600 
be bad as well we'll see so in the left

side strike position we have
quagliarella<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:42.059> probably<00:00:42.270> gonna<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
quagliarella that's probably gonna be

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
quagliarella that's probably gonna be
the<00:00:42.510> best<00:00:42.930> player<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:44.070> squad<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.520> just
