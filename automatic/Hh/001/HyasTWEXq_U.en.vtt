00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Now that he is here and I can not sing for 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 video rebels dotcom on this occasion 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.899
 let's see the different types of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.040
 microphones and under what circumstances 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.040
 use each of them 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.629
 5 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.820
 although you might think otherwise 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 audio is very important the production of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 a video and many times it can be 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 the difference between a material video and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 a professional video many times the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.199
 audio is not very well taken care of especially 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.970
 at amateur level or in productions of 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.699
 low budget such as videos 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.309
 for internet where it is vital to have a 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.220
 good audio even more than a good 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.059
 image, even if it looks like a lie 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.980
 normally the microphones that come 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.530
 integrated in the video cameras not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 they are very good they are very basic and many 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 sometimes they put the sound of the engine of the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.170
 same camera is best to use a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.420
 external microphone to capture a better 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.519
 sound there are many types of 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.080
 microphones in this video we will see 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.390
 in a very general way just so that 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.339
 have unity of each of them and in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.979
 what circumstances is the best option to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 use for example we have the microphone of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 hand these microphones are ideal for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.520
 interview on the street or where there is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 a lot of noise around the advantage of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.270
 these microphones is that they eliminate 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 quite the noise around the subject 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 that speaks and you can use them very close to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.290
 the person if you are going to do between 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 reports this type of microphones is your 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.090
 best option since they work from the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.490
 better way here you take off and you're going to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 get very clear audio even if there's 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.330
 a lot of noise around but if 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.490
 you want to use more separate from the subject that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.090
 He talks most likely he gets a lot 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.219
 environmental sound 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.289
 other type of microphones in the vall gear 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.329
 these can be wired and 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.039
 wireless the advantage of these 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.319
 microphones is that you can put them very 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.600
 near the subject who speaks and in addition to 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.640
 hide them in their clothes as they are about 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.709
 centimeters of the fountain can capture 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.020
 very good sound and isolate the noise 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.850
 around this type of microphones are 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.250
 ideal for type interviews 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 testimonials or for interviews where 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.649
 controls that there is not much noise 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.479
 around 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.280
 for example at this moment I am 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
 using a bathtub microphone 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.970
 often doubled the jr are used 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.459
 also to make cinema and television of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 fiction but the disadvantage of this if not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.360
 accounts with a lot of budget is that the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.069
 microphones should be very good 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.530
 quality so they do not get interference 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.120
 or noises when outdoors or in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.640
 very large places and usually 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 These good the Balearic Islands are very expensive 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.329
 besides that it is very possible that as 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.890
 are hidden in the meta actors the 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.530
 noise when rubbing with clothes if they 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.360
 move a lot you could also use a 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 the wire baller or the cable 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.230
 connected 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.450
 or if it is a fiction as a 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.159
 movie or a short then you would have 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.500
 First of all, take care that the cable does not 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.269
 you see box and the other would be that your 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.590
 actors would not have much freedom of 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.870
 move around the same as they are 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.950
 connected unless it was about 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 a scene where they are all the time 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.010
 sitting and still good there is the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.020
 risk of noise being heard when 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.270
 pink with clothes so it moves 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.430
 for fiction it is better to use the other type 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.680
 of microphone called these clash 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.780
 microphones are usually used with 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.240
 a boom or a long tube that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.710
 they hold the clashes have the advantage 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.110
 to capture the audio that is generated 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.580
 mainly the microphone is 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 widely used to make films as 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.350
 it isolates the sound around and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.450
 behind him even when he captures the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.270
 sound around and behind but what 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.710
 catch with much less intensity 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.510
 concentrating on capturing more what is 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.640
 in front of him 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.959
 for that reason so that they work well you must 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.540
 put them a few inches from the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.280
 talking person pointing to his mouth 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.840
 there that the bump is used to hold 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.269
 this type of long-range microphones 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.640
 distance if you put them too far from the 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.510
 sound source will not pick up the audio with 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.430
 clarity 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.799
 you should put them as close as you can 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.260
 taking care not to be seen in your shot if you go 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.360
 to make shorts or if not any kind of 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.849
 fiction the shakedown is your best option 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.040
 of microphone finally we have the 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.379
 studio microphone this is ideal for 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.000
 Do voice-over or voice-over are used 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.430
 in enclosed spaces that are free of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.470
 noise these microphones pick up the voice with 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.180
 very good quality but they must be 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.280
 near the person speaking for 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.859
 get the most out of only a few 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.829
 centimeters from his mouth so for another 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.130
 kind of situations will not work for you if you go 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.110
 to do speech or podcast or even 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.900
 record musical instruments or you 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.190
 singing this type of microphones is your 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.920
 best option 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 these are four types of microphones that 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.720
 they are normally used to produce 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.460
 video, the ideal is that you have all 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.780
 the different types of microphone for 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.150
 be prepared for any 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.070
 situation the prices and qualities of 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.260
 each vary according to the model and 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.480
 mark well since you already knew the 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.240
 different types of microphones and so you go 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.680
 to be able to decide which is the most appropriate 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.570
 for the type of video that you want 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.550
 do remember that not only is it the 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.560
 microphone is also to use the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.410
 accessories like sponges for 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.660
 eliminate your own or the sound of 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.480
 air when they stick the microphone too 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.190
 it is very important to take care of the levels 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.640
 audio is not too high not 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.310
 saturate e that are not too low and if 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.140
 you can edit the sound clean it 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.520
 and put some effects on the 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.310
 post-production that's very helpful 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.140
 to improve it and well I hope that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.580
