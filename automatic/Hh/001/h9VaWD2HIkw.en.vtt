00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:11.880
 [Music] 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.570
 straighter and hard - line wheels 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.880
 to dismount first step is 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 learn the air using the steering wheel 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.250
 fixing and centering the rim 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:01:09.460
 the second step abuts the support base 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.170
 articulated in the rim and then access 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.759
 the lower doors of the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.649
 third step is to use the 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.259
 hydraulic jack so that the device 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:25.479
 have wheel performance touch the spot 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:35.610
 kneaded pressing the monkey so that 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:38.680
 repair is performed to align the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.310
 first step is to lower the monkey 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.740
 second hydraulic easy to adjust 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.799
 rods for home spinning alignment 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.479
 even identifying locals of allies 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.880
 the alignment is done through the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.880
 adjusting the radii with the lightning bolt 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.209
 will play dorÃ© and the hard line of wheels 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.780
 developed and deforested 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.450
 Wheeled motorcycle wheels or alloy wheels 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.599
 light alloy is required 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.599
 knowledge alloy only performance
