00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.170
 concentrate and want to express all that 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.440
 we conceived 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.579
 and I want to be as technical as possible and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.579
 expressive and 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.199

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.559

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 No, 6 years old 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.220
 my mother gave me a notation in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.659
 kindergarten was a girl merged lips 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 her mom was allowable and she suggested 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.110
 so I danced myself. age 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:27.090
 danced so very romantic and of course 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:27.090
 two times backward backward wide 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 Come on, everything changed, I freak I 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.759
 I am totally obsessed with dancing 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.869
 Yes, I play a play, I shoot and when 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.840

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.399
 I worry, but probably for years 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.130
 my main profession here does not give me 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.390
 opportunities to surrender and give in 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.660

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.460
