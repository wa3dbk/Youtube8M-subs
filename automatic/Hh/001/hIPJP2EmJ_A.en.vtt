Mario<00:02:29.980> let's<00:02:30.849> go<00:02:31.060> through<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.500> articulation

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
Mario let's go through the articulation

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.339 
Mario let's go through the articulation
points<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> head<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.629> head<00:02:34.930> joint

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
points we have a head and a head joint

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.960 
points we have a head and a head joint
right<00:02:36.159> here<00:02:36.430> or<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.610> next<00:02:37.060> point<00:02:37.299> but

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
right here or a next point but

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.240 
right here or a next point but
doesn't<00:02:38.270> go<00:02:38.450> all<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.810> way<00:02:39.290> from<00:02:39.710> all<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.160> way

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.730 
doesn't go all the way from all the way
or<00:02:40.520> turn<00:02:40.970> around<00:02:41.240> 360<00:02:41.690> because<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.350> chin<00:02:42.560> is

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500

just a single jointed knee and an ankle

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.670 
just a single jointed knee and an ankle
joint<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.330> recommend<00:03:02.660> getting<00:03:02.930> Mario<00:03:03.500> as

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
joint so I do recommend getting Mario as

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.070 
joint so I do recommend getting Mario as
a<00:03:03.710> standalone<00:03:04.130> figure<00:03:04.580> but<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:04.910> also<00:03:05.420> recommend

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
a standalone figure but I also recommend

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.850 
a standalone figure but I also recommend
getting<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.700> diorama<00:03:07.700> set<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.360> set<00:03:08.600> B<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
getting the diorama set a and set B it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.640 
getting the diorama set a and set B it
would<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.250> more<00:03:10.820> fun<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> put<00:03:12.140> them<00:03:12.440> all

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
would be more fun to put them all

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.310 
would be more fun to put them all
together<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.600> position<00:03:14.600> them<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:14.930> your<00:03:15.080> shelf

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
together and position them on your shelf

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.520 
together and position them on your shelf
or<00:03:15.620> even<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.340> desk<00:03:17.270> this<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.870> oh<00:03:18.020> this<00:03:18.320> is

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
or even on your desk this is oh this is

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.490 
or even on your desk this is oh this is
a<00:03:18.890> cool<00:03:19.250> set<00:03:19.730> especially<00:03:20.420> with<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.020> diorama

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
a cool set especially with the diorama

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.220 
a cool set especially with the diorama
set<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.370> also<00:03:22.820> with<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.240> diorama<00:03:23.690> set<00:03:24.020> B

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
set a and also with the diorama set B

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.650 
set a and also with the diorama set B
but<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:24.980> finally<00:03:25.459> gets<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> most<00:03:26.180> popular

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
