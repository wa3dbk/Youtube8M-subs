00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.110
 numerous media outlets cover 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.120
 the actuality of the real society but 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.889
 for various reasons mainly 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.720
 economics now report from the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.930
 distance about our team 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.930
 loves 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.970
 everyone would have liked to come but 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.580
 only two daily media 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.289
 Basque and sports world have brought their 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.009
 Special envoys to concentration 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.009
 from parma 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.780
 a day of these journalists is more 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 hard than you would imagine at first 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.160
 morning time already move to one of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.410
 your work places the hotel of 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.540
 Team concentration 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.640
 hello good afternoon of parma we are here 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.380
 with the editor of the Basque newspaper 'míchel 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.510
 gonzález, how are the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.879
 vacation for barman as fine one 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 little bit of cool these days but 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.559
 good thank you not in the height of summer 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.510
 this temperature is always welcome 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 jokes aside his daily work consists 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.259
 in being next to the team 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.950
 the problem this trip are tolls 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.170
 although it seems curious when 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.759
 we go to the displacements to the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 matches or when we come from the airport 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.380
 from Milan until here until the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 concentration of pharma so that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 we always choose to follow the bus 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 which is the most common and the most reliable 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 but of course how he has the ticket and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.990
 we have to pay we have some 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.759
 ordinary booths then lose it from 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.640
 sight as soon as you get to the first 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.000
 roundabout later you get confused 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.400
 in the objective before the toll 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.290
 we hit an accelerator to see if we win a 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.360
 little time but yesterday we lost it 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.270
 we lost before reaching good if 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 curious is that we go for the with the gps 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.210
 trying to see to see where the toll is 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.300
 then we say good there are four left 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.170
 kilometers I have to step slow already 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.190
 advance until you try to arrive with a 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.290
 A little bit of time you do not know what 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.800
 you know many times if that toll has 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.060
 a detour or is the main but good 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.520
 although it is a little chaos not everything 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.690
 are the roundabouts and this way of 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.540
 driving italy so far we have 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.440
 had luck 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.370
 is cast to drivers in italy 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.440
 his second stop still early has 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.750
 place in the training camp in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.990
 this case school facilities 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.710
 sports of parma 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.990
 there they converse they observe they advance texts 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.780
 and even act as photographers 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.700
 improvised everything you see necessary 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.490
 to keep their 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.510
 readers I think it's something necessary 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.090
 do not have here to inform our 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.910
 amateurs of what is happening in 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 Italy of how the days go by 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 the parties and think thank you not what 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.550
 good that several means as they approach 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.540
 up to the hotel and well that 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.850
 we also have a lot of pressure 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.980
 but we support it is worse, almost 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.230
 the days that there is no match because we 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.480
 we throw all day here with you 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.130
 once the training is over 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.260
 expedition and journalists return to 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.870
 headquarters where it's the turn of 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.880
 the interviews with the soccer players are 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 moments in which the relationship between 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.400
 both guilds narrows to the point 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 that some joke also fits 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.760
 is that the day is going fast 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.650
 we work and I think we are 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.860
 pretty much what I've seen 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.260
 lot of pool and little work of mechel 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.819
 but many pools here in our 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.939
 hotel here there in the hotel of 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.739
 concentration man some dip 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.260
 Once in a while you have to stick 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.540
 because with 35 degrees after chatting with 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.209
 the michelin angel stars return to 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.430
 your hotel for lunch except for one of the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.109
 days where they share table and tablecloth 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.489
 with the members of the board of 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.870
 administration that have traveled 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.879
 accompanying the team 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.860
 they also advance all the work that 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.650
 can and if they have a moment 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.319
 of breath suffocates in the embarrassment of the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.290
 best possible way 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.959
 and good to the possible each one exercising 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.060
 your work and with respect to one goes to what 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.360
 yours to one 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.540
 spend more hours in the pool than here 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.850
 but but in general risks throughout 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.200
 of this stage when he has not touched session 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.850
 vespertina has played 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.040
 at the same time as when the equipment arrives 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.080
 stadium the journalists collect their 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.420
 accreditations and rise to the Tribune 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.230
 press where they advance with their pages 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.230
 until the initial beep 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.169
 after the match they collect the impressions 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.149
 of the protagonists and prepare for 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.879
 the closing of the edition the chronicle for 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:57.159
 the newspaper chronicled for the web with 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.169
 your task of the day culminated and sent san 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.649
 Sebastian arrives at the hour of rest 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.719
 not too much as you could check 

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:06.719
 it is the hard life of the special envoy
