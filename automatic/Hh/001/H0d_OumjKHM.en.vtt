long life without developing diseases

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.319 
long life without developing diseases
and<00:01:37.259> therefore<00:01:37.829> without<00:01:38.009> suffering<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> then

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and therefore without suffering and then

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.020 
and therefore without suffering and then
that's<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.409> real<00:01:40.619> goal<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.250> our<00:01:41.400> research<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that's the real goal of our research you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.770 
that's the real goal of our research you
have<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> understand<00:01:42.810> again<00:01:43.290> how<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:43.979> can

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
have to understand again how we can

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
have to understand again how we can
reduce<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.409> gap<00:01:46.799> between<00:01:47.100> health<00:01:47.640> span<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
reduce this gap between health span and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
reduce this gap between health span and
lifespan<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.649> 30<00:01:49.920> years<00:01:50.070> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
lifespan and now is around 30 years so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
lifespan and now is around 30 years so
