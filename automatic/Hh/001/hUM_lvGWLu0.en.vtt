in<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:00.780> section<00:00:01.290> what<00:00:01.469> we<00:00:01.620> want<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> do<00:00:01.979> is

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in this section what we want to do is

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.980 
in this section what we want to do is
show<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.340> where<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.879> can<00:00:03.090> get<00:00:03.240> side<00:00:03.570> pressure

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
show you where you can get side pressure

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.270 
show you where you can get side pressure
so<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.410> can<00:00:04.620> press<00:00:04.890> up<00:00:05.720> panels<00:00:07.069> we<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.099> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
so you can press up panels we have a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.890 
so you can press up panels we have a
customer<00:00:08.910> who<00:00:09.170> wanted<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.230> press<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.830> actually

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
customer who wanted to press up actually

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.049 
customer who wanted to press up actually
flooring<00:00:12.900> decorative<00:00:13.440> flooring<00:00:13.980> where<00:00:14.849> he

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
flooring decorative flooring where he

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.560 
flooring decorative flooring where he
had<00:00:15.470> three<00:00:16.470> pieces<00:00:16.820> that<00:00:17.820> he<00:00:18.000> wanted<00:00:18.390> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
had three pieces that he wanted to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.130 
had three pieces that he wanted to
attack<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> 3/4<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.490> 3/8<00:00:21.210> inch<00:00:21.449> substrate

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
attack to a 3/4 or 3/8 inch substrate

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.689 
attack to a 3/4 or 3/8 inch substrate
and<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.449> worked<00:00:24.750> out<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.800> he

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and so what was worked out is and he

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
and so what was worked out is and he
lays<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.240> his<00:00:27.570> three<00:00:28.199> pieces<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.859> his

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lays up his three pieces on his

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.799 
lays up his three pieces on his
substrate<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.170> then<00:00:31.170> he<00:00:31.769> puts<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> sled

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
substrate and then he puts it on a sled

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.069 
substrate and then he puts it on a sled
like<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.700> then<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> whole<00:00:39.180> thing<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> put

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
like this then the whole thing is put

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.160 
like this then the whole thing is put
into<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> bag<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.270> side<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
into the bag and then on the side to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 
into the bag and then on the side to
give<00:00:43.379> additional<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:44.399> pressure<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.149> put<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
give additional side pressure we put a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
give additional side pressure we put a
stick<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.820> side

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
stick like this so you have more side

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
stick like this so you have more side
pressure<00:00:48.719> pressing<00:00:49.379> against<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:50.010> thin

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pressure pressing against your thin

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
pressure pressing against your thin
pieces<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:52.379> particular<00:00:52.860> case<00:00:53.370> what

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
pieces in this particular case what

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.920 
pieces in this particular case what
we're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> we're<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> glue

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we're going to do is we're going to glue

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
we're going to do is we're going to glue
up<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.289> couple<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.910> panels<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.360> we're<00:00:57.570> not

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
up a couple of panels but we're not

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.319 
up a couple of panels but we're not
going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> use<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.530> substrate<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.210> we're

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
going to use the substrate and we're

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.760 
going to use the substrate and we're
going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> show<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:01.260> different<00:01:01.289> methods

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
going to show you two different methods

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.359 
going to show you two different methods
one<00:01:02.539> where<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> piece<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> side<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
one where we put a piece on the side and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.580 
one where we put a piece on the side and
the<00:01:05.610> other<00:01:05.810> we're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> wedge<00:01:07.260> our

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the other we're going to wedge our

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
the other we're going to wedge our
pieces<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> wedge<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.570> give<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> side

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
pieces in with a wedge to give you side

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.580 
pieces in with a wedge to give you side
pressure<00:01:10.530> also<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.930> cases<00:01:13.380> where

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
pressure also this is for cases where

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
pressure also this is for cases where
you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> different<00:01:14.400> widths<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> let's<00:01:16.170> get

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you have different widths so let's get

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
you have different widths so let's get
set<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.299> different

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
set up for this here I have different

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.490 
set up for this here I have different
width<00:01:19.560> pieces<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.500> designed

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
width pieces and and this is designed

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.690 
width pieces and and this is designed
for<00:01:22.710> those<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.460> doing<00:01:24.799> irregular<00:01:25.799> with

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
for those that are doing irregular with

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
for those that are doing irregular with
pieces<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.159> your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
pieces so that when you come to your

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.590 
pieces so that when you come to your
4-foot<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.930> example<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> may<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
4-foot with for example you may not have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.890 
4-foot with for example you may not have
exactly<00:01:34.110> 4<00:01:34.650> feet<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> get

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
exactly 4 feet and so you want to get

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
exactly 4 feet and so you want to get
one<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> overhang<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.400> little

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
one that's going to overhang a little

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.490 
one that's going to overhang a little
and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.409> squeeze<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.759> wedge

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
and then you just squeeze in this wedge

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
and then you just squeeze in this wedge
now<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> wedge<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.909> obviously<00:01:45.659> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
now what the wedge does obviously this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
now what the wedge does obviously this
gives<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> side<00:01:46.560> pressure<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gives you the side pressure and it

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
gives you the side pressure and it
actually<00:01:48.119> causes<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.409> buckling<00:01:50.070> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually causes a little buckling up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
actually causes a little buckling up
which<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.210> fine<00:01:51.509> because<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.320> put<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
which is fine because when we put this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.280 
which is fine because when we put this
in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> press<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:54.960> pressed

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
in the press it's going to get pressed

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
in the press it's going to get pressed
down<00:01:55.560> flat<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.880> almost<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.750> ton<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
down flat you have almost a ton of

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
down flat you have almost a ton of
pressure<00:01:58.380> per<00:01:58.799> square<00:01:59.189> foot<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.180> have

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
pressure per square foot here so we have

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.340 
pressure per square foot here so we have
about<00:02:01.130> 6<00:02:02.130> tons<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.700> pressure<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.869> down<00:02:04.110> on

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
about 6 tons of pressure going down on

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.190 
about 6 tons of pressure going down on
this<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.740> it'll<00:02:05.009> come<00:02:05.219> out<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.850> flat

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
this so it'll come out good and flat

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.070 
this so it'll come out good and flat
I've<00:02:07.200> made<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.890> sled<00:02:08.750> alright<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I've made my sled alright with a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.640 
I've made my sled alright with a
substrate

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
substrate

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.880 
substrate
I've<00:02:13.650> got<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.310> edged<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:15.000> two<00:02:15.780> sides<00:02:16.170> I've

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
I've got it edged on two sides I've

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
I've got it edged on two sides I've
rounded<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.610> over<00:02:17.910> my<00:02:18.090> edges<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.590> allows

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
rounded it over my edges and this allows

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
rounded it over my edges and this allows
me<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.490> push<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:21.000> pieces<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:24.260> straight<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
me to push my pieces in straight so that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.730 
me to push my pieces in straight so that
they<00:02:25.860> butt<00:02:26.160> up<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.030> my<00:02:27.330> my<00:02:28.050> shape<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
they butt up and I have my my shape that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.360 
they butt up and I have my my shape that
I<00:02:28.770> want

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I want

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.410 
I want
and<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.920> when<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> put<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.060> press

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and now when I put it in in the press

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.260 
and now when I put it in in the press
and<00:02:33.720> pull<00:02:34.230> vacuum

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
and pull vacuum

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.360 
and pull vacuum
I'll<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.600> pressure<00:02:36.930> down<00:02:37.320> here<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.070> have

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I'll get pressure down here I have

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
I'll get pressure down here I have
enough<00:02:38.820> side<00:02:39.210> pressure<00:02:39.860> from<00:02:40.860> from<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.760> that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
enough side pressure from from this that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
enough side pressure from from this that
I<00:02:43.350> don't<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:43.950> pressure<00:02:44.610> from<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.990> bag

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
I don't need pressure from the the bag

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.800 
I don't need pressure from the the bag
so<00:02:47.550> what<00:02:47.790> we're<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.510> we're<00:02:48.660> going

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.810 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:48.900> glue<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.320> one<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.520> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
to glue this one up and put it in and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.800 
to glue this one up and put it in and
then<00:02:51.830> we're<00:02:52.830> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> glue<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
then we're going to glue this one in and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.550 
then we're going to glue this one in and
put<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.590> top<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:57.150> show<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:58.050> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
put it in on top to show you that you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.360 
put it in on top to show you that you
get<00:02:58.830> side<00:02:59.160> pressure<00:02:59.610> also<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.100> do

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
get side pressure also you can do

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.540 
get side pressure also you can do
multiple<00:03:03.180> pieces<00:03:03.570> on<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.710> in<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.280> same

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
multiple pieces on on the in the same

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.050 
multiple pieces on on the in the same
frame<00:03:05.970> press<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.510> bag<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.820> make

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
frame press or bag you just have to make

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.780 
frame press or bag you just have to make
your<00:03:09.450> total<00:03:09.900> setup<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:11.580> you're

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
your total setup so that what you're

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.510 
your total setup so that what you're
gluing<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.510> slightly<00:03:12.960> higher<00:03:13.440> than<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.010> sled

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
gluing is slightly higher than the sled

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.260 
gluing is slightly higher than the sled
and<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.590> way<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.100> top<00:03:17.400> sled<00:03:17.760> now<00:03:18.000> will

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
and and that way the top sled now will

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.910 
and and that way the top sled now will
press<00:03:18.570> down<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.070> bottom<00:03:20.880> pieces<00:03:21.390> and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
press down on the bottom pieces and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.160 
press down on the bottom pieces and
press<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.220> flat<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.660> go<00:03:24.840> along

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
press them flat and as we go along

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.820 
press them flat and as we go along
you'll<00:03:25.740> see<00:03:26.070> how<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.000> works<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:28.560> I'm

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
you'll see how this works so now I'm

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.580 
you'll see how this works so now I'm
just<00:03:29.010> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.310> glue<00:03:29.520> them<00:03:29.730> up<00:03:36.380> we're<00:03:37.380> ready

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
just going to glue them up we're ready

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.290 
just going to glue them up we're ready
now<00:03:37.709> we're<00:03:38.100> going<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> put<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.580> second<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.120> on

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
now we're going to put the second one on

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.690 
now we're going to put the second one on
I<00:03:39.630> put<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> piece<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.380> plastic<00:03:40.709> between<00:03:41.190> them

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
I put a piece of plastic between them

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.699 
I put a piece of plastic between them
because<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> don't<00:03:42.360> want<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> stick<00:03:42.870> them<00:03:43.080> one

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
because I don't want to stick them one

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.690 
because I don't want to stick them one
to<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> other<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:50.040> frame<00:03:50.280> press<00:03:50.550> is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
to the other the frame press is

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.810 
to the other the frame press is
obviously<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.270> better<00:03:52.220> suited<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.520> than<00:03:53.730> a

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
obviously a better suited to this than a

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.540 
obviously a better suited to this than a
bag<00:03:54.060> because<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.990> could<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.709> laid<00:03:55.920> my<00:03:55.950> pieces

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
bag because I could have laid my pieces

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.860 
bag because I could have laid my pieces
especially<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:57.060> you're<00:03:57.180> doing<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.480> four<00:03:57.690> by

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
especially if you're doing a four by

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.330 
especially if you're doing a four by
eight<00:03:57.900> or<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.230> big<00:03:58.440> sheet<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.860> just<00:03:59.070> lay<00:03:59.220> them

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
eight or a big sheet you just lay them

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
eight or a big sheet you just lay them
up<00:03:59.490> in<00:03:59.670> place<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.330> close<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.200> lid<00:04:01.350> when

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
up in place and close the lid when

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.820 
up in place and close the lid when
you're<00:04:01.740> done<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.120> my<00:04:03.150> side<00:04:03.660> piece<00:04:04.110> it's

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
you're done this is my side piece it's

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.880 
you're done this is my side piece it's
going<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.190> give<00:04:05.310> me<00:04:05.490> more<00:04:05.730> side<00:04:06.090> pressure<00:04:06.890> than

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
going to give me more side pressure than

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:19.190 
going to give me more side pressure than
just<00:04:08.250> these<00:04:08.489> thin<00:04:09.209> pieces<00:04:09.720> here

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.290 

we<00:04:20.200> press<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.739> down<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> bag<00:04:21.880> didn't

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
we press this down so the bag didn't

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540 
we press this down so the bag didn't
tempt<00:04:22.570> away<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.290> came<00:04:23.590> down<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.130> hid<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
tempt away it came down and hid in the

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.909 
tempt away it came down and hid in the
corners<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.900> I'm<00:04:26.050> getting<00:04:26.260> more<00:04:26.620> side

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
corners here so I'm getting more side

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.730 
corners here so I'm getting more side
pressure<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.020> look<00:04:29.169> at<00:04:29.410> pressure

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
pressure you have to look at pressure

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.629 
pressure you have to look at pressure
based<00:04:30.160> on<00:04:30.430> where<00:04:31.240> vacuum<00:04:31.810> is<00:04:31.990> being<00:04:32.260> applied

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
based on where vacuum is being applied

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.480 
based on where vacuum is being applied
these<00:04:33.639> are<00:04:33.850> only<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.180> quarter-inch<00:04:34.660> wide

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
these are only a quarter-inch wide

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.990 
these are only a quarter-inch wide
pieces<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:38.050> one-inch<00:04:38.410> wide<00:04:38.710> piece<00:04:39.340> so

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
pieces this is a one-inch wide piece so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.350 
pieces this is a one-inch wide piece so
applying<00:04:40.960> pressure<00:04:41.380> which<00:04:41.950> is<00:04:42.330> four<00:04:43.330> times

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
applying pressure which is four times

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.600 
applying pressure which is four times
what<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.230> quarter-inch<00:04:44.650> would<00:04:45.040> apply<00:04:47.610> so

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
what the quarter-inch would apply so

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.090 
what the quarter-inch would apply so
we're<00:04:48.790> all<00:04:48.910> tight<00:04:49.210> we'll<00:04:49.480> just<00:04:49.720> let<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.110> dry

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
we're all tight we'll just let this dry

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.430 
we're all tight we'll just let this dry
and<00:04:51.430> we'll<00:04:51.640> take<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.330> out<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.870> we'll<00:04:53.140> see<00:04:53.169> what

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
and we'll take it out and we'll see what

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.110 
and we'll take it out and we'll see what
it<00:04:53.530> looks<00:04:53.740> like<00:04:53.950> it's<00:04:54.580> been<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.760> couple<00:04:55.000> of

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
it looks like it's been a couple of

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.510 
it looks like it's been a couple of
hours<00:04:55.450> so<00:04:55.600> we<00:04:55.750> can<00:04:55.900> take<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.110> out<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:56.430> one<00:04:57.430> of

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
hours so we can take it out now one of

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.280 
hours so we can take it out now one of
the<00:04:57.580> things<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:58.030> forgot<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.570> mention<00:04:58.720> earlier

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
the things I forgot to mention earlier

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.810 
the things I forgot to mention earlier
is<00:04:59.380> that<00:04:59.790> if<00:05:00.790> your<00:05:01.060> pieces<00:05:01.450> are<00:05:01.870> not<00:05:02.260> even<00:05:02.980> if

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
is that if your pieces are not even if

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.090 
is that if your pieces are not even if
they're<00:05:04.090> not<00:05:04.300> all<00:05:04.540> the<00:05:04.690> same<00:05:04.750> thickness<00:05:05.350> you

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
they're not all the same thickness you

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.219 
they're not all the same thickness you
can't<00:05:06.370> do<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.700> stacking<00:05:07.270> very<00:05:07.510> well<00:05:07.780> because

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
can't do the stacking very well because

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.659 
can't do the stacking very well because
some<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> pieces<00:05:08.979> won't<00:05:09.130> get<00:05:09.370> pressed

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
some of the pieces won't get pressed

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.659 
some of the pieces won't get pressed
down<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.660> if<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.870> if<00:05:11.110> they<00:05:11.470> are<00:05:11.500> uneven<00:05:12.250> put

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
down so if you if they are uneven put

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.850 
down so if you if they are uneven put
them<00:05:12.790> at<00:05:12.970> in<00:05:13.150> between<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:13.900> it'll<00:05:14.169> compress<00:05:14.620> and

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
them at in between so it'll compress and

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:23.760 
them at in between so it'll compress and
then<00:05:15.160> everything<00:05:15.639> will<00:05:15.790> get<00:05:15.940> pressure<00:05:22.770> here's

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
then everything will get pressure here's

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:37.980 
then everything will get pressure here's
our<00:05:23.979> panel

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:46.150 

here's<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.230> other<00:05:39.380> one<00:05:44.470> on<00:05:45.470> these<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.980> course

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
here's the other one on these of course

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.880 
here's the other one on these of course
the<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:47.480> quality<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:48.110> joint<00:05:48.440> somewhat

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
the the quality of joint somewhat

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.850 
the the quality of joint somewhat
depends<00:05:49.400> on<00:05:49.550> how<00:05:49.930> parallel<00:05:50.930> your<00:05:51.140> pieces<00:05:51.620> are

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
depends on how parallel your pieces are

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.310 
depends on how parallel your pieces are
these<00:05:52.490> would<00:05:52.760> just<00:05:52.970> cut<00:05:53.180> on<00:05:53.300> a<00:05:53.330> table<00:05:53.900> saw<00:05:54.110> they

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
these would just cut on a table saw they

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.600 
these would just cut on a table saw they
didn't<00:05:54.530> go<00:05:54.620> through<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.860> joint<00:05:55.220> or<00:05:55.370> anything

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
didn't go through a joint or anything

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.650 
didn't go through a joint or anything
like<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:58.160> joints<00:05:58.520> looks<00:05:58.700> pretty

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
like that and the joints looks pretty

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.590 
like that and the joints looks pretty
good<00:05:59.870> obviously<00:06:00.320> it's<00:06:00.740> a<00:06:00.860> stiff<00:06:01.130> panel<00:06:01.610> it's

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
good obviously it's a stiff panel it's

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.370 
good obviously it's a stiff panel it's
staying<00:06:02.900> together<00:06:03.050> without<00:06:03.560> any<00:06:03.740> problem
