00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good to all and welcome to me 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.610
 welcome to a new video channel 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 we already have a lived team this time 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.469
 the player that I have chosen to do the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.089
 team around him is may in this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 tot player that outside or on screen 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.449
 that I had not planned to try it but I've 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 seen that a lot of people said it was a 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.170
 very good player who had to prove it 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.870
 even people who said it was the best 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 touch of the consistent and good then 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.300
 I was struck by the desire to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.370
 try it so watch a team around 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 from him to prove it and give us my opinion 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.460
 about him as always before beginning with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 the video tell you that if you can with me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 like if you can with your layman 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.970
 I appreciate very much and if we can pass 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.020
 of the 150 x again it would be great and 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.079
 now we are going to see the team 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.970
 united so pretty simple starting 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 for the goal we have diego alves a 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.489
 goalkeeper that lately I'm 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 doing quite heavy and I'm 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.060
 putting quite but it is not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.190
 working very well makes me very 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.240
 is a goalkeeper that I recommend and if not 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.920
 he has explored it so you can try it 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.330
 defense of four we do not have to 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.610
 laterals on the left record by the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.620
 dani alves right and the center 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.510
 of power stations better said to felipe 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.680
 santana and miranda 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.059
 a defense that a player is that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.010
 I use pretty much always 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.840
 they work well in defense and for me 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.610
 frozen very well midfield 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.620
 where we have of my centers luis 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.390
 gustavo and thiago touch and with the center 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
 defensive kevin de bruyne luis gustavo 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.450
 Well then, always for me one of the 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.490
 best defensive midfielders 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.230
 game of bruijn possibly one of the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.660
 best offensive midfielders in the game 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.640
 a great player and whose author wanted it 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.610
 try because it catches my attention I think 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.070
 which is quite cheap new 28 thousand 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.560
 coins I think the minimum that is now and 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.200
 I think behind modric and enzo pÃ©rez or 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.570
 fighting with them would be on the podium 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.160
 of the best midfielders of bea and 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.619
 Greek Spanish there is not much player 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.180
 to put in this position by bands 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.369
 we have on the left rossi frame by 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 right to wellington silva or power 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.930
 fast players with a very good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.020
 dribble royce four skills 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.730
 wellington silva 5 skills entered is a 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.680
 very good shot also 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.470
 players that good especially for the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 speed and for the dribble and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.540
 of forward center as well as sober 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.660
 we have a player mayer as I say 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.890
 I did not plan to try it but I think 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.390
 It has been worth trying it has 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.710
 liked enough for you to make a 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.710
 idea those who have tried ibra 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.840
 can play a lot like ibra in 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.420
 some aspects that I would say are 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 three the first the shot in one shot very 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 very similar and now we will talk a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.810
 little more of him the second would be the subject 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 of the physicist measures one centimeter more than 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.070
 ibra so they are practically the same and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.050
 they both have a lot of strength and the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.330
 third aspect would be the issue of the pass is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.770
 a free fel fort player that is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 front center but he also knows 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.120
 attend and then mayer with mier happens what 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.880
 same thing that I did not like 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.110
 a lot of him or what I liked 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.720
 not in some aspects I liked 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.540
 but but good, I wanted to highlight those that 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 in the theme of the world has medium in 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.350
 attack and high in defense and that makes 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.060
 many times is a little behind has 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.910
 there have been times when it seems that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.959
 in training was 433 option 5 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.150
 where you play with a playmaker 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.220
 because I was more delayed than the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.720
 extremes that has certain advantages already 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.780
 that mayer is a player that if he catches 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.640
 ball 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.580
 a bit in the middle of the field so that 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.310
 keep and do not have anyone ahead 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.140
 Well, the truth is that we are not going to run 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.459
 with him because it's likely that 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.650
 before getting to the goal get the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.000
 ball or open bands or try 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.740
 delay the baron and take a little more 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.330
 but if the pgje from the front of the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.870
 area in those positions within the area 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.480
 the best shot lethal What I have been 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.790
 liked it a lot but it's a shot 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 has a lot of power has a great 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.230
 lapse the quality shot a shot of 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.330
 quality that is powerful and at the same time with a 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.400
 great effect is a shot very very quality 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.840
 good with the right leg because it has 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.459
 two leg is worth while with the leg 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.450
 left has scored some goal and yes that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.580
 it's true with the left leg 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.680
 also shoots with a lot of power with 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.890
 much force then with the right leg 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.720
 obviously your shot is much better 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.360
 then the issue of footwear and such for 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.079
 up is going pretty well what then I 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.030
 ground 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.440
 try first players because he saw the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.560
 statistics that you have inside the eye to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910
 through soccer and these pages and I 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.190
 it did quite well for preparers like 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.590
 has scored a lot of goals and I fixed 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.660
 after he only has 51 jump 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.370
 which I really would not say has 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.569
 the game would say he had more because the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.859
 truth is that for the centers that I've 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.380
 fact that there have not been many of proven 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.880
 especially his shot and suzlon shot well 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.699
 has scored more than just one more goal 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.340
 head as I say the issue of speed 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.800
 is a subject that if you do not like to play with 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.229
 players that are slow because they do not 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.690
 you have 50,000 players marquez 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.550
 are very fast and this is red to which 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.420
 you are looking but continue but better 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.370
 a little different 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.010
 the resemblance to a player with a 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.260
 great physicist has that ability to 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.140
 assist the other players and a 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.330
 brutal awesome barbarian shot 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.030
 Well, I think it's worth trying 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.530
 I bought it for 60 thousand coins but I think 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.690
 that the price will continue to fall further 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.030
 because it is that people do not 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.790
 will buy simply people prove it 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 people like me who want to try it and already 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.850
 it brings a lot in the market that 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.770
 do not buy so I guess it will go 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.840
 lowering the price little by little so 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.270
 native let's hope you liked the video 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
 the team is meyer's mini review and 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.440
 what good if you want to try it 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.420
 I recommend it forward and I think a 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.650
 great striker even as midfielder 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.480
 offensive I think it works could 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.980
 work quite well but good what 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.470
 what was done inside what is with him 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.150
 is the shot the pass and the physical that has 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.920
 and nothing else guys I think we are still 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.690
 you know that if tuning is to give 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.920
 like I will not leave you with a link with 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:35.690
 goals now because the goals that 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:39.100
 now there if we see you next 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.100
 video up soon
