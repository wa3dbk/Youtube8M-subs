won't really come off and then so you
have<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.689> and<00:04:39.990> then<00:04:40.229> see<00:04:40.439> it<00:04:40.560> kind<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:42.650> kind

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
have that and then see it kind of kind

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.589 
have that and then see it kind of kind
of<00:04:43.740> stands<00:04:44.129> up<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.370> little<00:04:44.580> bit<00:04:44.699> like<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.030> it's

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
of stands up a little bit like that it's

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.520 
of stands up a little bit like that it's
a<00:04:45.659> little<00:04:45.900> high<00:04:46.050> but<00:04:46.530> um<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.819> think<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.180> works<00:04:48.530> so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
a little high but um I think it works so

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.429 
a little high but um I think it works so
yes<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.009> have<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.370> there<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:50.900> then<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.289> can

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
yes you have that there and then you can

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.379 
yes you have that there and then you can
do<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> same<00:04:52.830> thing<00:04:53.099> just<00:04:53.939> kind<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.210> measure

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
do the same thing just kind of measure

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.670 
do the same thing just kind of measure
it<00:04:54.569> out<00:04:54.659> but<00:04:54.930> you're<00:04:55.050> gonna<00:04:55.169> need<00:04:55.409> a<00:04:55.439> bigger

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
it out but you're gonna need a bigger

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.760 
it out but you're gonna need a bigger
piece<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.250> like<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.060> take<00:04:57.210> off<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.780> off<00:04:58.349> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
piece I like to take off the off the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.540 
piece I like to take off the off the
stairs<00:04:59.069> and<00:04:59.520> the<00:05:00.150> wheels<00:05:00.419> because<00:05:01.099> they<00:05:02.099> won't

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
stairs and the wheels because they won't

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.430 
stairs and the wheels because they won't
touch<00:05:02.879> the<00:05:03.090> ground<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:03.719> it's<00:05:04.020> too<00:05:04.259> high

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
touch the ground because it's too high

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
touch the ground because it's too high
for<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:05.389> so<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:07.590> have<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:07.919> kind<00:05:08.039> of<00:05:08.129> like<00:05:08.250> that

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
for it so you have it kind of like that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.850 
for it so you have it kind of like that
and<00:05:08.699> then<00:05:08.879> you<00:05:09.030> do<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.259> same<00:05:10.440> thing<00:05:10.710> with

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
and then you do the same thing with

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.990 
and then you do the same thing with
another<00:05:11.099> piece<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.530> your<00:05:13.530> end<00:05:13.740> result

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
another piece so that your end result

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.869 
another piece so that your end result
goes<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.360> looks<00:05:15.479> something<00:05:15.840> like<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.849> so<00:05:17.849> I

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
goes it looks something like that so I

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.490 
goes it looks something like that so I
just<00:05:18.150> put<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.449> a<00:05:18.509> little<00:05:18.539> bit<00:05:18.870> on<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.319> other

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
just put it a little bit on the other

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.339 
just put it a little bit on the other
side<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.580> it'll<00:05:20.909> stand<00:05:21.690> up<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.050> mean<00:05:22.199> it's

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
side so that it'll stand up I mean it's

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.519 
side so that it'll stand up I mean it's
not<00:05:22.590> going<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.830> stand<00:05:23.009> up<00:05:23.569> on<00:05:24.569> its<00:05:24.810> own<00:05:24.930> but

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
not going to stand up on its own but

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.469 
not going to stand up on its own but
that's<00:05:25.830> kind<00:05:26.159> of<00:05:26.189> what<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.460> e3d<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:27.090> for<00:05:27.300> you

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
that's kind of what the e3d is for you

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.290 
that's kind of what the e3d is for you
kind<00:05:27.659> of<00:05:27.719> prop<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.110> up<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:29.340> haven't<00:05:29.909> really<00:05:30.270> been

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
kind of prop it up I haven't really been

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.779 
kind of prop it up I haven't really been
able<00:05:30.569> to<00:05:30.750> stand<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:31.440> up<00:05:31.529> on<00:05:31.800> its<00:05:31.979> own<00:05:32.129> which<00:05:32.759> is

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
able to stand it up on its own which is

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.999 
able to stand it up on its own which is
kind<00:05:33.240> of<00:05:33.300> annoying<00:05:33.569> me<00:05:33.979> but<00:05:34.979> with<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:37.009> with

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
kind of annoying me but with the with

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.390 
kind of annoying me but with the with
the<00:05:38.360> terminal<00:05:39.919> standing<00:05:40.919> up<00:05:41.009> against<00:05:41.310> the

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
the terminal standing up against the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.540 
the terminal standing up against the
terminal<00:05:41.819> and<00:05:41.969> it<00:05:42.120> propped<00:05:42.599> up<00:05:42.810> on<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:44.039> a380

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
terminal and it propped up on the a380

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.719 
terminal and it propped up on the a380
it<00:05:45.240> stays<00:05:45.629> so<00:05:46.620> that's<00:05:46.800> kind<00:05:47.039> of<00:05:47.099> how<00:05:47.279> you<00:05:47.310> do<00:05:47.580> it

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
it stays so that's kind of how you do it

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.279 
it stays so that's kind of how you do it
I'm<00:05:47.909> not<00:05:47.969> really<00:05:48.389> gonna<00:05:48.659> waste<00:05:48.839> any<00:05:49.050> more<00:05:49.169> of

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
I'm not really gonna waste any more of

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.619 
I'm not really gonna waste any more of
your<00:05:49.409> time<00:05:49.849> by<00:05:50.849> showing<00:05:51.089> you<00:05:51.270> how<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.419> shoot

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
your time by showing you how to shoot

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.659 
your time by showing you how to shoot
the<00:05:51.779> second<00:05:52.110> part<00:05:52.529> but<00:05:52.620> you<00:05:53.190> kind<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.430> get<00:05:53.580> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
the second part but you kind of get the

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.189 
the second part but you kind of get the
idea<00:05:53.969> on<00:05:54.029> how<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:54.389> do<00:05:54.839> it

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
idea on how you do it

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.260 
idea on how you do it
and<00:05:55.379> I<00:05:55.710> would<00:05:55.889> reinforce<00:05:56.430> this<00:05:56.879> a<00:05:56.909> little<00:05:57.089> bit

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
and I would reinforce this a little bit

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.640 
and I would reinforce this a little bit
more<00:05:57.389> with<00:05:57.569> a<00:05:57.599> couple<00:05:57.900> more<00:05:58.050> pieces<00:05:58.199> of<00:05:58.469> tape

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
more with a couple more pieces of tape

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.890 
more with a couple more pieces of tape
just<00:05:59.099> so<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.490> stays<00:05:59.729> and<00:06:00.089> then<00:06:00.659> same

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
just so that it stays and then same

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.879 
just so that it stays and then same
thing<00:06:01.110> on<00:06:01.259> this<00:06:01.440> one<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:03.289> see<00:06:04.289> if<00:06:04.349> it'll<00:06:04.500> focus

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
thing on this one so see if it'll focus

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.730 
thing on this one so see if it'll focus
there<00:06:05.759> yeah<00:06:05.969> yeah<00:06:06.210> see<00:06:06.449> so<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.050> added<00:06:07.259> a<00:06:07.469> couple

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
there yeah yeah see so I added a couple

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.019 
there yeah yeah see so I added a couple
pieces<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:08.039> tape<00:06:08.370> on<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.789> um<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:11.610> yeah<00:06:11.789> I<00:06:11.819> mean

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
pieces of tape on it um so yeah I mean

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.439 
pieces of tape on it um so yeah I mean
that's<00:06:12.150> pretty<00:06:12.330> much<00:06:12.509> it<00:06:12.719> and<00:06:12.930> then<00:06:14.449> when

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
that's pretty much it and then when

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.209 
that's pretty much it and then when
you're<00:06:15.569> done<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:17.310> can<00:06:17.520> put<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.539> on<00:06:18.719> your<00:06:19.219> a380

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
you're done you can put it on your a380

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.209 
you're done you can put it on your a380
and<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:22.080> have<00:06:22.319> a<00:06:23.240> triple<00:06:24.240> jet<00:06:24.569> bridge<00:06:24.779> system

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
and you have a triple jet bridge system

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.430 
and you have a triple jet bridge system
going<00:06:26.219> on<00:06:26.370> so<00:06:27.150> I<00:06:27.180> think<00:06:27.539> it's<00:06:27.659> kind<00:06:27.870> of<00:06:27.960> cool<00:06:28.169> I

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
going on so I think it's kind of cool I

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.399 
going on so I think it's kind of cool I
think<00:06:29.099> it<00:06:29.250> owns<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:30.300> works<00:06:30.569> which<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:31.199> nice

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
think it owns it works which is nice

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.170 
think it owns it works which is nice
because<00:06:32.339> I<00:06:32.669> wanted<00:06:33.180> to<00:06:33.240> get<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:35.060> wanted<00:06:36.060> to

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
because I wanted to get the I wanted to

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.420 
because I wanted to get the I wanted to
get<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.659> old<00:06:37.020> terminal<00:06:37.529> because<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:38.039> had<00:06:38.250> the

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
get the old terminal because it had the

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.860 
get the old terminal because it had the
triple<00:06:38.669> jet<00:06:38.969> bridge

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
triple jet bridge

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.960 
triple jet bridge
but<00:06:40.020> I<00:06:40.410> mean<00:06:40.920> it's<00:06:41.070> not<00:06:41.190> really<00:06:41.460> necessary

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
but I mean it's not really necessary

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.080 
but I mean it's not really necessary
anymore<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.750> mean<00:06:43.380> it's<00:06:44.070> always<00:06:44.250> necessary<00:06:44.910> you

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
anymore I mean it's always necessary you

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.720 
anymore I mean it's always necessary you
always<00:06:45.390> if<00:06:45.690> you<00:06:45.810> can<00:06:45.990> get<00:06:46.680> the<00:06:46.920> old<00:06:47.310> terminal

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
always if you can get the old terminal

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.220 
always if you can get the old terminal
you<00:06:47.880> want<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.180> old<00:06:48.330> terminal<00:06:48.750> because<00:06:48.930> it<00:06:49.110> can

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
you want the old terminal because it can

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.440 
you want the old terminal because it can
fit<00:06:49.410> so<00:06:49.560> many<00:06:49.740> more<00:06:49.860> planes<00:06:50.190> um<00:06:51.440> but<00:06:53.120> see<00:06:54.120> so<00:06:54.300> it

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
fit so many more planes um but see so it

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.180 
fit so many more planes um but see so it
looks<00:06:54.720> like<00:06:54.870> that<00:06:55.050> and<00:06:55.380> it's<00:06:55.740> kind<00:06:55.950> of<00:06:56.010> cool

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
looks like that and it's kind of cool

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.010 
looks like that and it's kind of cool
and<00:06:56.430> you<00:06:56.820> can<00:06:56.970> kind<00:06:57.150> of<00:06:57.210> do<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.360> relatively

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
and you can kind of do it relatively

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.750 
and you can kind of do it relatively
anywhere<00:06:58.350> I<00:06:58.560> like<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.920> do<00:06:59.040> it<00:06:59.160> on<00:06:59.220> this<00:06:59.430> corner

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
anywhere I like to do it on this corner

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.360 
anywhere I like to do it on this corner
because<00:07:00.030> it<00:07:00.150> has<00:07:00.300> the<00:07:00.650> two<00:07:01.650> jet<00:07:01.920> bridges<00:07:02.130> that

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
because it has the two jet bridges that

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.820 
because it has the two jet bridges that
work<00:07:02.700> I<00:07:03.000> mean<00:07:03.990> I'm<00:07:04.140> sure<00:07:04.170> that<00:07:04.350> you<00:07:04.530> could<00:07:04.710> do

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
work I mean I'm sure that you could do

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.570 
work I mean I'm sure that you could do
the<00:07:04.980> same<00:07:05.160> thing<00:07:05.370> over<00:07:05.520> here<00:07:05.640> with<00:07:06.200> the<00:07:07.200> double

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
the same thing over here with the double

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.920 
the same thing over here with the double
gate<00:07:08.580> you<00:07:09.330> just<00:07:09.660> need<00:07:09.990> a<00:07:10.050> little<00:07:10.200> bit<00:07:10.410> more<00:07:11.930> you

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
gate you just need a little bit more you

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.690 
gate you just need a little bit more you
just<00:07:13.170> need<00:07:13.290> a<00:07:13.320> bit<00:07:13.650> more<00:07:13.680> extension<00:07:14.400> to<00:07:14.550> it

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 
just need a bit more extension to it

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.830 
just need a bit more extension to it
because<00:07:15.300> there<00:07:15.690> one<00:07:15.900> it's<00:07:16.440> like<00:07:16.560> not<00:07:17.840> it

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
because there one it's like not it

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.590 
because there one it's like not it
wouldn't<00:07:19.170> like<00:07:19.290> fit<00:07:19.740> because<00:07:20.670> it's<00:07:20.910> not<00:07:21.390> as

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
wouldn't like fit because it's not as

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.340 
wouldn't like fit because it's not as
long<00:07:23.480> because<00:07:24.480> let's<00:07:24.720> see<00:07:24.840> if<00:07:24.960> you<00:07:25.050> bring<00:07:25.200> it

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
long because let's see if you bring it

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.690 
long because let's see if you bring it
over<00:07:25.440> here<00:07:27.860> you'd<00:07:28.860> have<00:07:29.040> to<00:07:29.190> have<00:07:29.340> it<00:07:29.550> like

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
over here you'd have to have it like

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.390 
over here you'd have to have it like
fully<00:07:30.030> extended<00:07:30.720> and<00:07:30.930> I<00:07:31.230> don't<00:07:31.770> think<00:07:31.980> that<00:07:32.280> it

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
fully extended and I don't think that it

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.090 
fully extended and I don't think that it
would<00:07:32.550> like<00:07:32.780> reach<00:07:33.780> the<00:07:34.050> terminal<00:07:34.290> and<00:07:34.800> the

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
would like reach the terminal and the

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.720 
would like reach the terminal and the
plane<00:07:35.370> so<00:07:36.650> I'd<00:07:37.650> like<00:07:37.980> to<00:07:38.160> do<00:07:38.250> it<00:07:38.340> over<00:07:38.460> here

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:38.730 
plane so I'd like to do it over here

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.890 
plane so I'd like to do it over here
because<00:07:38.910> I<00:07:39.000> know<00:07:39.060> that<00:07:39.300> there's<00:07:39.480> two<00:07:39.540> gates

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
because I know that there's two gates

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.770 
because I know that there's two gates
here<00:07:40.110> that<00:07:40.290> it'll<00:07:40.530> work<00:07:40.560> with<00:07:41.060> so<00:07:42.060> yeah<00:07:42.240> so<00:07:42.570> um

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 
here that it'll work with so yeah so um

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.330 
here that it'll work with so yeah so um
that's<00:07:43.140> pretty<00:07:43.380> much<00:07:43.470> it<00:07:43.680> that's<00:07:44.040> how<00:07:44.280> you

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 
that's pretty much it that's how you

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.390 
that's pretty much it that's how you
that's<00:07:44.700> how<00:07:44.940> I<00:07:44.970> did<00:07:45.120> that<00:07:46.040> so<00:07:47.040> I'd<00:07:47.190> like<00:07:47.340> to

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 
that's how I did that so I'd like to

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.250 
that's how I did that so I'd like to
