00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.909
 Organ first come to the allegiance of Traktor three study over act today 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.510
 a feature the girl very many users after I have asked a lot of the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.259
 Prague Stock Exchange Tokio Turk 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.549
 I did not know that recently that this feature is available 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.380
 Tractor Aurich shows you this is also the to play list 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.820
 Tractor to have at many 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.089
 to the DM 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.409
 who wanted to accuse their school know if now also tractor 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.259
 automated a playlist Fred can work off to Fred 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.650
 if, for example, you are a part of the one or the man 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.250
 just want to climb a bit at home 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.080
 The feature is not more powerful than a Winamp Lell is because it is editing 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.340
 The cracks are not improvising the cracks do not play them one 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.500
 only gradually and gradually 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.649
 but you want who of both gliders there is "Variety" 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.230
 Possibilities to do it all I have with Tom selected a playlist 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.310
 No and he would now work off the playlist completely, he does that me 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.910
 suffer the first track 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.390
 Rheine because that's the work 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.400
 Name can start running 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.000
 and who would start this step now and then two games two 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Possibilities and in Copenhagen on my out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480
 such a second way 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.050
 but already invited first 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.450
 and now I'm up here on Play 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.340
 Now he has activated the orthopedist and would now after the first track 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.780
 played from Pekhart finished in the second step loading the rich same 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.450
 Beckmann's a coil 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 After that, I showed regret the second option 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.279
 dorbi he sows the second track it also allows he endangered himself 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.520
 As I said, he did not adapt himself and when the wind overturns it, for example 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.080
 edited track is who now I say 20 seconds per lap one 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.350
 Silence in the end has 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.550
 Then you have to turn the second option is the little bit 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.880
 But it is not that much more comfortable that I am comfortable with mine 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.640
 errors 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.210
 but Chris is 30 percent if I have either mouse or mouse for 60 years now 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.380
 I now with the iPad or he starts chatting on deck dpa 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.359
 but also that unedited so that it's just as good i can a bit 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.669
 will vary better when the race is over 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.819
 and so if I go for example as a godfather the door on the move if so 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.109
 still the spring operated 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.989
 and nothing else makes the nice story for the KEC in the field 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 not usable at all so it is still to do 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.719
 but you do not have to do much anymore today 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.759
 that was bloated Dr function 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:04.449
 who is enough about the Quelles as the procedure we then after the 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.399
 normal guidelines that I'll show you a little bit more about the program 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:08.289
 to start 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:09.840
 Car Kley though 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.150
 you have wished EU comes that if you want to see other things 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.349
 I have not done yet 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.560
 where I sat he wrote four on the slip then he writes has a private one 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.569
 Message never hurts so I can organize the whole thing a bit better 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.339
 and easy 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.370
 first the agreement that he 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.549
 would like to see if Eck did not forget to vote that has rub and 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.839
 the group 2 9 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:31.079
 we are watching the next video
