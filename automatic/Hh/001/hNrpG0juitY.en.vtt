00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.350
 I 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello friends who are here Phoenician street 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 in the new video entitled Moms 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.500
 versus dragonball z but before passing 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 to the video I want to give thanks 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.869
 very special to the people who have been 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.050
 supporting on my channel that you are my 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.000
 people my subscribers in which he has 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 interested my channel is not that it has 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.380
 liked and have been there supporting me in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.820
 my videos 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.280
 I must say that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.160
 I am very happy because the channel went up 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.129
 100 subscribers in three days which 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.340
 it was very very very rewarding to see that 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.500
 has gone up so fast we are almost 500 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.660
 I'm missing 5 I think 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.970
 and well, we must also say that part 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.100
 of all this was because Mr. Chucho 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.800
 sea ​​that after my I talked 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.290
 by facebook decided to upload my video leave 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 their votes where I showed their knots 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.330
 with uploaded to your facebook page and that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.140
 he made the video will have 600 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.420
 reproductions to have 3,500 and both 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.610
 this one like that of the super mods 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.850
 saiyans jean-pierre super sayayin se 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.490
 they will position quite well on youtube 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.400
 currently I think that speaking we see are 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 the videos that are most at the peak of 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.620
 youtube and that crashes my channel so 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.840
 a tad more known in 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.250
 among the new people that still 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.350
 speaks Spanish and Latin America 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 it's very rewarding because for a channel 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.800
 small as mine a low channel 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.020
 Sayayin category of low class very well 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.179
 in dragon ball z 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.429
 It's a pretty pretty high 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.229
 gratifying truth then nothing 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.240
 thank you to the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.250
 sir they will listen for also for your 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.110
 collaboration because thanks to him is that 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.480
 this rush could also be given 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 then an environment many thanks 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.330
 really and nothing to see if we get to the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.100
 500 subscribers 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.630
 five robberies are missing to see who is going to be 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.160
 the number 500 damn watermelons then 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.190
 nothing more 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.640
 let's turn to the video that concerns us 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.280
 moms versus center dragon on time 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.780
 if these farms where the village and the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.780
 video we just finished 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 dragonball was anime that premiered 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.700
 for better latin continent over there in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 the year 1997 create without counting what time 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 back had already been released under the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.790
 name of ciro and the magic dragon and that 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.250
 of course it turned out to be a failure 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.300
 resounding maybe in another video about that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.400
 topic 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.140
 today still I like both 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.000
 old as new generations 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.160
 fortunately for us in 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 those times most of the anime was 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.960
 brought directly from japan thing that 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.330
 it is appreciated because it did not go through the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.370
 demonic and censored hands of the 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.440
 gringos this also had its 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 consequences and I say it because for that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.350
 then most of our moms 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.510
 they live counted 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.550
 well these series distract was that they were 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 those famous phrases against said 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.720
 encourage that even after so long 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 we remember and they cause us a lot of grace 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.620
 this is a small top of those hours is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.990
 that our mothers used against 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.230
 dragon ball and out to terrorize us 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.230
 or just to prohibit is not to see it 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.230
 let's start 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.920
 oh my family your boys but everything 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.360
 changed in other takes tickets for if 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.840
 continue fine you see yourself now finish 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.970
 same charges 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.550
 and I was sure if it was in this sentence in 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.440
 the last of the first place to me 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.450
 personally it caused me too much 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.030
 bewilderment when the mobile of the mouth 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.800
 from mom dina me precisely in a 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.470
 scene when it appeared on cri link and 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.599
 vegueta but it is also true that part 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.459
 of the brightness no one else will have heard it 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.569
 as the impact may not be the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
 same 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.709
 yes, every time I remember 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.170
 cause the same grace that I am consulting 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.950
 I saw her for the first time we have the like 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.950
 something more personal 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.709
 the devil lead him down the path of 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.709
 take 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.320
 This is one of the most classic for 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.090
 moms all encouragement and no matter which 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.190
 they belonged to satanic sects that 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.570
 They seek to drive the kids yesterday road 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.570
 to the sea are very exaggerated 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.400
 and those Chinese cartoons yes that 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.560
 they are good ash 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.110
 The interesting thing about this sentence was that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.389
 they said ugly now that they were called goats 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.389
 for almost the entire pack with power to a 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.560
 animated boss series made by Chinese 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.560
 generally satanic Chinese 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.919
 and my son how is it possible that talc and 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.250
 that is a child be the dad of such johan 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.430
 who is 25 years old, my God, who 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.500
 they said yes gentlemen is now the sentence by 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.120
 excellence of both living work and my 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.490
 aunt when I and my cousins thought 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.500
 dragonball of those of all labors 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.530
 in explaining to them why I was a child 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.720
 he had them they never never activated 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.360
 to understand that it will not be rather that 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.400
 they wanted to understand now what I want 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.530
 to know is why they said something to him that coconut 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.580
 and my aunt had the peculiarity of 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.580
 tell him to welcome me 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.369
 but this day and endesa shit has to 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.509
 lower Chinese brand bing said when 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:37.449
 none of the above sentences 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.459
 worked resort to violence and no 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.199
 if you were watching dragon ball at 10 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.599
 of the night by end not and the other day 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.669
 I had to get up early to school I think 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.670
 with this almost never fails it turned off the 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.820
 television yes or yes 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.210
 bryant and this one with 24 years old and still 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.760
 still with grief I should give 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.569
 They are already worried you should yes 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.520
 I think so 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.289
 and here so that we are already adults and not 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.360
 we can dragon with this phrase and its 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.699
 derivatives we will have to go by part 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.860
 of our moms because in the head of 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.020
 they still do not fit when we have a 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.149
 race over we work and we 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.849
 We consider professionals to follow 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.860
 seeing dead dragon to ideas nor it in 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:24.050
 that failed to let my lord fail 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.969
 and you condition many sentences that 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.169
 we are going to find in some goal or some 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.020
 another spirit and that they have marked you 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.550
 we are in the comments 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.229
 I hope you can either like it and 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.110
 it has reminded me of just a few 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.120
 months ago and in the aic and subscribe 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.889
 it would only help me to its return and for 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.310
 last remember to kiss him and a 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.240
 huge hug to your American moms 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.240
 see you later
