00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 little bit of that shopping I did 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.710
 is a cetain olive 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 it's really a little golden glass 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.489
 really but sublime and that I wanted 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.960
 really for a little while so 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.729
 I was so happy to have had it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 for Christmas so I had chosen well 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.729

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.750
 I redid but mac pallet 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.240
 so if you're interested in seeing my 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.049
 balls be redone 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.880
 because I bought another pallet 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 life so we lose so I put fars say 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 the me comment a set I bought 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.150
 a new perfume with them mine me 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 I had more and it was the highlight and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.280
 so I did not have the perfume anymore so me 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 who likes to change the perfume I have 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 decided to buy the strong bond of viktor 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 rolf don that's like this so with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.549
 a pain like that they are really 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.640
 very very good thing which boys who 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:00.689
 feels like a barbery 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.250
 I almost bought the barberine and and 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.870
 I found that this one you were a little 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.060
 more floral and costs 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.060
 he double burberry so I bought 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.270
 this one so the box is like that so 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.930
 that's without really very good so 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.640
 so here and I bought one more so 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.050
 with the sometimes it was at beauty 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 success I'm going to buy 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.030
 I bought the rapid resign customers 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.510
 because you will see in show these of 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.510
 lancôme 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.570
 so it's a makeup remover for the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.070
 waterproof so for the eyes and that is 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.460
 really very very well I used it 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.680
 for a few days and ideas maggie 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.150
 really very very good 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.010
 so all that is written in bold the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.630
 mascara and all that so really very 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 well you have to finish buying 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.390
 so I bought my favorite products 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.560
 which is the spine that's so I bought 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.710
 the two students from the last 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.150
 collection from Mac called I 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.300
 am not like a name so be 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.440
 that would bar the info anyway 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.450
 this is the last collection 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.820
 no it does not want very chic it's 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.709
 more finally short anyway this is the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.480
 last collection so on the site 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.580
 judged that they are exhausted 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.750
 unfortunately that's no longer really 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.320
 very quickly on the site as you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.340
 know and suddenly I bought both 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.380
 so the first is necessarily pink 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.140
 so I have eaten all tpt of them 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.200
 to receive 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.310
 after I ordered this on the site 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.620
 camille anyway the days for 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:45.840
 happen so she's like this is 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.060
 So it's a mother of pearl is beautiful 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.280
 really super clear knows super 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.709
 board 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.739
 In the winter I believe that it really 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.850
 but it's really mother-of-pearl 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.500
 in so a little dough a little pink 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.930
 is wonderful 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.600
 frankly I'm too happy for 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.150
 winter in my opinion this is beautiful I 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.750
 have not tried to receive it yet 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.750
 but beautiful 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.820
 and the second is pink stereo she 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.910
 is much darker than I 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.860
 thought I sent to do that that I 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.280
 think she's super strong when 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:40.570
 we see it like that and so it's a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.220
 coral and coral a little pink is trimmed 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.190
 shock both loved the way he really 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.090
 super n'agrée and it's beautiful 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.610
 on the way the two are superb 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.520
 so I absolutely do not regret 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.070
 usually we knew that I'm a fan and 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.470
 but those at mac so she was 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.550
 for me it was for me an obligation 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:08.020
 to buy them so 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.510
 so that's what I bought and then the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.400
 pharma I received a gift I am 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.320
 really happy here are my little ones 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.120
 purchases which I hope this little 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.900
 video will please you but we find ourselves 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.070
 very quickly 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.070
 finally the next and the aisles
