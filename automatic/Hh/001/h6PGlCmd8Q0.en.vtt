might<00:04:09.229> get<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.409> shot<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:10.129> rather<00:04:10.310> than<00:04:10.519> use<00:04:10.699> a

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
might get a shot that rather than use a

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.770 
might get a shot that rather than use a
chainsaw<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:14.060> this<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.419> back<00:04:14.569> of<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
chainsaw so this is the back of the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.379 
chainsaw so this is the back of the
gardens<00:04:15.169> now<00:04:15.319> looking<00:04:15.680> from<00:04:16.000> quite<00:04:17.000> over<00:04:17.269> to

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
gardens now looking from quite over to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.629 
gardens now looking from quite over to
the<00:04:17.539> far<00:04:18.229> side<00:04:18.500> looking<00:04:18.829> across<00:04:19.099> to<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.489> house

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
the far side looking across to the house

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.990 
the far side looking across to the house
and<00:04:20.620> my<00:04:21.620> plan<00:04:21.859> would<00:04:22.039> be<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:23.830> train<00:04:24.849> put<00:04:25.849> up

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
and my plan would be to train put up

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.339 
and my plan would be to train put up
some<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.389> stuff<00:04:26.630> here<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.080> tree

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
some of this stuff here like this tree

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.379 
some of this stuff here like this tree
that's<00:04:27.500> fallen<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:28.580> clear<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> whole<00:04:29.060> area

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
that's fallen it's clear the whole area

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.580 
that's fallen it's clear the whole area
and<00:04:29.949> in<00:04:30.949> aisle<00:04:31.250> am<00:04:31.490> I've<00:04:31.909> sprayed<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.110> next

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and in aisle am I've sprayed and next

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.930 
and in aisle am I've sprayed and next
year<00:04:33.770> I'll<00:04:33.889> probably<00:04:34.099> have<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.310> cross<00:04:34.550> again

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
year I'll probably have to cross again

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.379 
year I'll probably have to cross again
and<00:04:35.919> hopefully<00:04:36.919> some<00:04:37.340> stage<00:04:37.580> rows<00:04:37.909> of<00:04:38.060> Ages

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
and hopefully some stage rows of Ages

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.140 
and hopefully some stage rows of Ages
and<00:04:38.949> maybe<00:04:39.949> have<00:04:40.159> a<00:04:40.190> garden<00:04:40.639> here<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.849> planets
