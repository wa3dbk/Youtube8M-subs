00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello Well, I happened to him 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.280
 collected and started so on gathered here 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.150
 front wing assembled without any 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.279
 problems all fit 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 here I was pvc in that lachik therefore 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.710
 used the gadget as a spacer between 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.940
 wing and 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.400
 arc 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.539
 the wheel also adjust the brakes but 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.989
 yet they are not pulled up with a little nut so here 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.970
 as it is, but here you can see for yourself 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.260
 scratched 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.960
 that the plug did not scratch because 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.000
 only now will begin to fade 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.650
 in principle, everything is covered with everything that's 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.050
 about the Crimea about 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.030
 pulling and still want to pay attention here 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.580
 on this bolt and in the summer I didn't have it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 the wheel went shaking left right up 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.580
 down as she wants and went 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.580
 now kind of tightened but ok 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.369
 put the ignition cover set up already 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.540
 diluted gasoline pumped up already started here 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 I'm headed now 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 I will ride again 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.440
 so but it remains to finish the plastic think 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.250
 essentially carbon fiber because now 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.430
 show because the plastic see for yourself yes 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:14.820
 here it is not at all clear that from the reverse 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:18.000
 the side can be seen that already repaired here 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.720
 and in principle, almost all remained 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.990
 small what's there to bring something 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.710
 pull something up to loosen up the stage 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.710
 all thanks to all
