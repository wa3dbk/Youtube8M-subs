stumbled across some of these lines of
sight<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> thought<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> would<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.380> foolish<00:01:25.830> not

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

get into it here the first spot for

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
get into it here the first spot for
today's<00:01:35.040> video<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> map<00:01:35.939> standoff<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
today's video is on the map standoff and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.609 
today's video is on the map standoff and
you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.020> sitting<00:01:37.259> behind<00:01:37.350> these

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can see I'm sitting behind these

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.160 
you can see I'm sitting behind these
haystacks<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.310> common<00:01:38.640> position<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.570> catch<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
haystacks a common position to catch the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 
haystacks a common position to catch the
enemy<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.159> popping<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.759> behind

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
enemy that might be popping up behind

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.550 
enemy that might be popping up behind
that<00:01:42.420> blue<00:01:42.689> barrel<00:01:43.049> over<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that blue barrel over there but I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
that blue barrel over there but I
figured<00:01:43.890> why<00:01:44.340> expose<00:01:44.759> myself<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.869> when

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
figured why expose myself this much when

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
figured why expose myself this much when
I<00:01:46.229> could<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.860> crouch<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.090> peek

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
I could actually crouch down and peek

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.510 
I could actually crouch down and peek
through<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.380> crack<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.250> right

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
through this little crack and see right

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
through this little crack and see right
above<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.970> blue<00:01:51.119> barrel<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.630> you'll<00:01:51.780> notice

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
above that blue barrel now you'll notice

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
above that blue barrel now you'll notice
I<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.470> shot<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> guy<00:01:53.280> dead<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> face<00:01:54.060> with

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I just shot a guy dead in the face with

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
I just shot a guy dead in the face with
the<00:01:54.479> most<00:01:54.659> powerful<00:01:55.049> weapon<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> game<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the most powerful weapon in the game and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.959 
the most powerful weapon in the game and
got<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> hitmarker

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
got a hitmarker

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.550 
got a hitmarker
well<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.930> you're<00:01:58.049> scooted

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
well that's because if you're scooted

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
well that's because if you're scooted
just<00:01:58.890> slightly<00:01:59.520> far<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:00.750> it'll

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
just slightly far to the right it'll

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.490 
just slightly far to the right it'll
actually<00:02:01.560> either<00:02:02.009> cancel<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:03.030> greatly<00:02:03.810> reduce

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
actually either cancel or greatly reduce

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.260 
actually either cancel or greatly reduce
your<00:02:04.530> damage<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> enemy<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
your damage that you do to the enemy so

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.310 
your damage that you do to the enemy so
you<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:06.659> sure<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> scoot

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you want to make sure that you scoot

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
you want to make sure that you scoot
just<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> left<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.879> safety<00:02:09.599> precaution

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just to the left as a safety precaution

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.080 
just to the left as a safety precaution
I<00:02:10.349> would<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.679> ahead<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.979> say<00:02:11.190> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.790> can

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
I would go ahead and say if you can

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
I would go ahead and say if you can
see<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> enemy's<00:02:12.660> gamertag<00:02:13.170> above<00:02:13.470> their

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
see the enemy's gamertag above their

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.350 
see the enemy's gamertag above their
head<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.040> probably<00:02:14.129> gonna<00:02:14.790> work<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.330> just

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
head it's probably gonna work so just

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.970 
head it's probably gonna work so just
make<00:02:15.780> sure<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.800> their

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
make sure that you can see their

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460 
make sure that you can see their
gamertag<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.420> possible<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.110> pull<00:02:19.349> this

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
gamertag and it is possible to pull this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
gamertag and it is possible to pull this
off<00:02:19.650> within<00:02:19.890> assault<00:02:20.400> rifle<00:02:20.640> or<00:02:20.730> an<00:02:20.819> LMG<00:02:21.269> but<00:02:21.660> I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
off within assault rifle or an LMG but I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.270 
off within assault rifle or an LMG but I
find<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.470> easier<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> sniper

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
find it so much easier with the sniper

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.920 
find it so much easier with the sniper
rifle<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.910> recommended<00:02:24.269> weapon<00:02:24.780> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
rifle so the recommended weapon of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.690 
rifle so the recommended weapon of
choice<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.500> line<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.709> sight<00:02:25.980> would<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
choice for this line of sight would be a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.390 
choice for this line of sight would be a
sniper<00:02:27.120> rifle<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.660> black<00:02:27.930> ops<00:02:28.230> 2<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:29.040> next<00:02:29.220> pot

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
sniper rifle in black ops 2 the next pot

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.369 
sniper rifle in black ops 2 the next pot
we<00:02:29.519> come<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.000> also<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.569> standoff<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.260> you'll

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379
