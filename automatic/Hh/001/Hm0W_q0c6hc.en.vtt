00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.300
 day we are at the polyclinic sant'orsola 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.740
 malpighi of bologna against if the true one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 star professor thanks for being with 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.790
 we have cutting-edge technologies 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 definitely revolutionized to medicine 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.560
 in recent years but it is still so 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.809
 the patient doctor relationship is important 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360
 for a person who needs 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.370
 feel that also the human relationship is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
 still a priority in addition to one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.410
 such advanced technology 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 I believe that many thinking about a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 surgeon think of a technician who 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.160
 uses his hands to take care of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 diseases and in some respects can 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 also be true that frequently 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 happen to think that then in the end 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 we are artisans who take care of a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.420
 sometimes even in a way I don't say 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.820
 coarse but with simple acts we say 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.729
 diseases that are extremely complex 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 which are based on biochemical problems 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.389
 and whatever else we are technicians and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.039
 the technological aspect certainly today is 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.009
 became much more important 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.210
 important in some disciplines 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 the technological aspect has therefore become 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.280
 more important and we work in environments 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.439
 which are and must always be more 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.429
 efficient as efficient as performance 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.840
 of efficient disease care from 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.179
 economic point of view because the money 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.719
 there is less and less and the material 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:47.299
 which we use is very expensive 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:50.009
 so sometimes we say be technical 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.119
 the use of technologies is increasingly 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.039
 important and this is a big risk 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.429
 for that for the profession of doctor 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:03.389
 because in any case the basis of the relationship 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.969
 there is always an act between patient and doctor 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:08.039
 of trust the patient makes in 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.810
 I always said to the doctor 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.910
 that when the patient comes to me in 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.470
 outpatient clinic and for the first time me 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 knows for the first time in that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.209
 moment decides to be operated by me 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.430
 to entrust his life to my hands a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.680
 what I can do is an act of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.719
 absolute trust because he didn't 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.819
 never seen doing that thing anymore 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.370
 be hurt or good maybe 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.810
 someone would have told him go to andrea 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.629
 star because he knows how to do it well because 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.760
 maybe he had been operated on by me and he was 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.640
 went well but certainly not e 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.950
 how do you go in that delicatessen because then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 below good but maybe sometimes it is not so 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 as good as we would expect so it's a 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.939
 act of absolute trust that the patient 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.430
 does this is something that should not be 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.019
 underestimated to the enemy because this 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.919
 act of trust passes through a 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:00.120
 very very important human relationship 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:02.939
 much that will then predominate in everything 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.549
 the relationship is the doctor and the patient 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.739
 so the biggest mistake he could 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.799
 be a doctor in this age and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.010
 just becoming a technician can not 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:19.120
 being a technician and just the doctor must 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.180
 always keep this very vital 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.250
 this breath of humanity that must 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.519
 always permeate his profession 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.260
 because I think the patient expects 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.709
 to heal expects an excellent one 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.180
 performance and surgery, however, is expected 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.370
 also to be able to do so much like 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 I can say less traumatic as possible for 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:49.690
 his psyche and the patient who is ill 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:52.599
 a man is always and always a weak man 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.090
 and a very fragile woman very easy 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.599
 you know the most fragile everything and often they are 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.079
 just the doctors when they get sick 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.519
 they forget they are doctors or even 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.659
 they bring out all their knowledge too 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.030
 what they learned in school 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.129
 at the university to be able to interpret 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.989
 as if they were scholars of gods 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.390
 researchers the disease that struck it 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.099
 because they think maybe in a moment of 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.329
 to find the solution to their own 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.100
 disease therefore in short, one is all 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.210
 sick I say very often to 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.740
 students that the doctor has to get sick 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.200
 at least once, perhaps, of an illness 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.630
 not serious but must know what it wants 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.180
 say to be sick but why to cure it 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.310
 better and I think then proposes patients 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.139
 it is very important to feel that there is 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.700
 that empathy on the part of the doctor is there 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.530
 is treating that famous alliance 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.930
 therapeutic of which we talk so much that 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.539
 often there is obviously no time 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.970
 there is the economy to do it but that 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.070
 for a patient is in therapy in childbirth 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.500
 some way it is a substantial part 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.479
 because most of the therapies that it is 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.720
 they also rely on a lot of technology 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.800
 advanced they usually can have 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.710
 a good end 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.250
 if the patient is collaborating between 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.630
 quotation marks in the sense and at least at least 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.150
 doctor and patient patient we are at 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.910
 doctor then to produce performance 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.120
 is the result we expect is a lot 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.190
 delicate, however, this essential relationship 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.349
 for the good purpose of the things that perhaps it is 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.539
 fundamental even more in this 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.580
 such technological worst times while 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.199
 before there was only that 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.849
 today it must be something instead 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.699
 which he supports in I am very convinced 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.419
 this yes is something to enhance for 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.419
 keep it
