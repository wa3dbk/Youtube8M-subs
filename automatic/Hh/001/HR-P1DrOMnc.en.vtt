polished<00:05:03.770> up<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.099> exhaust<00:05:04.370> because<00:05:04.639> it

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
polished up the exhaust because it

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.390 
polished up the exhaust because it
needed<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.560> not<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.650> major<00:05:06.800> likes<00:05:07.099> I<00:05:07.190> just

little<00:05:11.510> bit<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.750> an<00:05:11.840> idea<00:05:12.080> of<00:05:12.460> how<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.520> replace

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970
