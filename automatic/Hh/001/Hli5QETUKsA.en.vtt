 Hello We have gotten the participation again 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.040
 which seems to be the favorite star of this show 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.920
 so with all of you coquito 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.720
 blueberry jam how to make marmalade 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.390
 750g ingredients of blueberries and 600g. of sugar 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.100
 and a splash of lemon pay attention because it's super easy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.820
 The first thing you are going to do is to wash the cranberries well and drain them 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.640
 The next thing we do to learn how to make homemade jam 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.920
 is to put the blueberries inside the pot with the sugar 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.280
 I put next hippie sugar, we take the pot as it is 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.640
 the homemade jam, without water, without anything on a high heat 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.680
 You will see how quickly in less than 5 minutes they start to release their juice. 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.330
 you keep stirring and follow her leaving on a strong fire 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.240
 when you see that the jam is boiling, you lower it to medium heat and throw it a good 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.290
 Lemon stream the lemon will preserve the dark color of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.990
 cranberry and goes to mass how to make homemade jam 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.890
 this amount of blueberries boiled around 7-10 minutes 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.270
 from there you arm yourself with patience because the preparation is going to get more and more 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.040
 liquid you simply every so often you have to go to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.869
 stir and take care not to stick to what I do while making the jam 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.820
 homemade is to sterilize the jars because they have to be ready when the jam comes out 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.521
 of blueberries if you want to know one of the ways there 

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:58.290
 to sterilize bottles click here I show you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.220
 returned my assistant how about coqui 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.780
 he wants a banana he told you that I have it boiling at minimum 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.470
 About 40 minutes ago, it looks like the blueberry jam is not going anywhere 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.410
 I'm going to tell you what he told me, calm me, patience, it's going to look like 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 but thick and the homemade cranberry jam is made 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.099
 We already have our homemade blueberry jam ready and we are going to pack it. it took 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.819
 in total about an hour and a half 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.480
 you have to remove it before because once the jam is thick enough 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 then never take it out exactly because you're going to get a massacre that you do not 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.550
 to be able to eat remember that preserves are always packed 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.830
 hot hot hot flask jam 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.583
 you're going to do this and leave it for a while like how to make jam 

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.480
 homemade because that generates vacuum and is better packaged 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.099
 little bottle tuned I am very happy with my jam 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:24.310

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.639
