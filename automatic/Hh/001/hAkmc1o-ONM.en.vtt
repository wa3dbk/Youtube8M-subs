00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.530
 the problem of contamination of crops and the fight against 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.170
 by them 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.130
 has always been highly relevant 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.089
 mechanical method of struggle gives 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.039
 significant effect 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.810
 associated with cost saving 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.449
 preparations for chemical weeding 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 harrowing is the easiest available and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.560
 effective weed control 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 along with this barnabas not and gives 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
 additional benefits in 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 agronomic measures and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.859
 use baron with bins 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.410
 significantly expands the scope

 use all cheats rams pc bolt 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 mesh bars our trigger designed 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.300
 for harrowing the soil directly 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.309
 before sowing 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 to combat the right rising weed 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.079
 harrowing is very important 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 crops for soil crust destruction 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 especially heavy floating soils 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 as a rule heavy rain falling in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 the period from sowing to germination and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 hot weather after them 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.929
 lead to the formation of soil crust 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.269
 it prevents air from reaching 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.519
 seeds difficult to germinate plants 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.650
 as a result, shoots heavily from less often 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 partially die and as a result 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 not uniform shoots all this in the end 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.799
 the result greatly reduces the yield and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 quality of agricultural products 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.159
 all 4 bar it applies when 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.470
 cultivating any agricultural 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.820
 crops and and the application should keep 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.399
 soil moisture reserves 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.409
 soil aeration ability use 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.450
 the instrument allows you to keep the water balance 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.329
 due to interruption of capillarity 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 surface sealing moisture dry watering then 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.810
 there is topsoil 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.990
 broken capillary communication system 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.540
 a loose mulch layer is created 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.860
 protecting the soil from drying out 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.869
 early spring harrowing of winter crops 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 provides not only moisture conservation 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.369
 but also the termination of fertilizers applied at 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.920
 feeding contributes to the destruction of the peel 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.899
 and better soil aeration removal 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.759

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 wintering weeds in a timely and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 qualitatively and holding it enhances 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.830
 yields for one and two or even three 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 and 1 hectare it is necessary to carry you 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.360
 already at an early deadline when the soil 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.110
 still wet but cannot but crumble from 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.090
 sounds in rams 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.980
 when cultivating various crops 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.350
 tools applied before shoots for 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.240
 fighting false prophets with weeds 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.670

 blind harrowing net harrow so 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.800
 and to achieve sprouts 25 centimeters 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.300
 blind to germination and harrowing mesh 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 harrow is considered pre-emergence 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.950
 technology is necessary 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.900
 agrotechnical reception is very important 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.940
 to choose the period of the meeting 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.590
 holding up shoots and after shoots them 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.450
 bar it allows you to reduce 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.200
 annual contamination of crops 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.090
 grassy weeds on 85 95 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.959

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.700
 application 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.550
 without rowing whole cultivation technologies 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.530
 crops thanks to the working width of the gun 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.990
 can be used on crops and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.880
 cultivated crops for the care of couples 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.130
 Moreover, the use of row crops 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.160
 am able to replace several visuals 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.660
 process them them about sense should be noted 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.910
 that harrowing significantly 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920
 more productive cheaper than inter row 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.269
 processing on row crops and all 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.100
 four rams are applied for 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.260

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.610
 used for leveling straw 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.680
 at the target use of this weapon 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.510
 significant savings are achieved 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.250
 chemical agents to combat 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.980
 weed for proper use 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.230
 mesh baron it is important to consider ripe 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.330
