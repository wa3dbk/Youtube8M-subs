00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.730
 the real zaragoza canaria in pucela 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.860
 so it was 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.430
 the tile team in a bad game 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.359
 he broke a worse streak that was already too long 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.869
 forty years concretely 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.079
 Valbuena that replaced the idea is due to injury of this in the warming 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.579
 it was great 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.529
 although in this play is witness of exception of the head of chema 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 that goes to the left of the Jerez goal 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.649
 the visitors showed themselves three times to bizarri's goal 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.689
 and a friend 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.260
 in the first half 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.380
 dale ti take advantage of the error of caesar july 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.970
 to stand in front of the Argentine goal 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.520
 but his shot is deficient irizarry and he manages to clear 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.050
 the Aragonese goal is not long in coming 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 movilla fouled a foul from the left 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.730
 imitate the spherical in the pot 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.470
 genÃ©relo is smarter than bizzarri and with his head in the arms of the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.110
 goalkeeper overcomes this and the defender so that the ball reached the bottom of the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.240
 goal 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.540
 it was the 6th minute and the real zaragoza was already ahead 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.149
 the valladolid with the noose around the neck in the classification goes up 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.810
 more with the heart than with the head 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 but enough to fence the opponent's goal 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.410
 At last a clear occasion taking advantage of the error in the clearance of 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.090
 Alvaro 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.010
 but his shot goes over the goal of a valbuena that had 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.270
 covered well 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.170
 The Madrid goalkeeper returns to be the protagonist to catch good shot of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.900
 oscar 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.620
 ford the valladolid from the front 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.829
 the real zaragoza had dissolved 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.490
 of the ball and followed his 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.150
 with a worrying lack of quality 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.660
 Julius Caesar finishes with the head but Valbuena catches without problems 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.960
 only two central zaragocistas committed two errors and they were of form 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.160
 continued 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.230
 the first ended with a chemistry shot that left very close to the 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.190
 stick 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.130
 the second would arrive at 6 minutes of the first 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 and also ends in goal 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.700
 mistake in marking by the right chema 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.990
 the playmaker takes a good center up 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.309
 free of mark from the penalty spot 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.620
 mark the times 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.639
 and sends the ball to the long pole 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 getting 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.749
 by dint of being sincere the Valladolid deserved to score 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.229
 and Zaragoza has received 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.209
 the game then entered the capsize that only broke on the verge of rest 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.279
 milito 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.279
 and sent a ball to the goal that was scored as a goal 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.489
 in the second half the real zaragoza improved ostensibly took over the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:32.950
 ball 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.529
 who did not play the first 45 minutes 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.949
 although the occasions 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.549
 they were scarce 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.219
 cali think decisive 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.299
 irizarry adjusted to the crossbar momentarily saves the second 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.899
 the match was already for the blanquillos and in the 75 a little more 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.919
 alberdi chet and the path of the changing rooms for double yellow cardboard 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.399
 he had already been cautioned in the first half 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.339
 the meeting was an Aragonese monologue 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.869
 volpi a lack in the front in the garden hits to clear 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:12.609
 improving its image for instants because later a minute later it would arrive 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.139
 the great blunder 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.439
 Julio Cesar the friend of before loses the ball on the edge of the area 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.069
 that the team is going the distant shot 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.650
 the ball goes out poorly what causes the boat lanteri sharry 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.760
 you can see how the ball 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.659
 even if it happens between the lawn if your arm 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.329
 sealing the zaragocista victory 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.479
 Valladolid did not even have the last matches 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.619
 adjusted 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.489
 because zaragoza is already another 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.209
 win by playing no 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.389
 and some will think the result is useless 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.569
 seeing the other markers today 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.529
 but the real zaragoza is out of the descent 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.709
 the valladolid is already behind 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.459
 and as he says
