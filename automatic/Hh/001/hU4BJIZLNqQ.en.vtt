now change this is just like the test
version<00:00:25.849> basically<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.119> cool<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
version basically you can cool the

way<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> conveyor<00:00:49.320> pad<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> conveyor

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
way to make a conveyor pad or a conveyor

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.830 
way to make a conveyor pad or a conveyor
belt<00:00:50.989> front<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> rear<00:00:52.410> pads<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:53.360> by<00:00:54.360> making<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
belt front and rear pads if by making a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
belt front and rear pads if by making a
long<00:00:55.020> line<00:00:55.199> layer<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.039> flying

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
long line layer so you don't get flying

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
long line layer so you don't get flying
off<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> side<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> end<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
off the side and then at the end you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.789 
off the side and then at the end you
could<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:01.980> something<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:06.650> just<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
could put something like that just so

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.320 
could put something like that just so
you<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.130> flying<00:01:08.580> off<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.060> end<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
you don't go flying off the end so go in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.800 
you don't go flying off the end so go in
get<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.110> walk<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:17.810> for

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
get up and you walk back out again for

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.120 
get up and you walk back out again for
people<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.409> about<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> recipe

sign in the middle redstone redstone
redstone<00:01:32.340> redstone<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> conveyor

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
redstone redstone and you get a conveyor

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.980 
redstone redstone and you get a conveyor
pad<00:01:38.000> obviously<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.270> its<00:01:39.420> own<00:01:39.540> doesn't<00:01:39.869> do

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pad obviously one on its own doesn't do

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.240 
pad obviously one on its own doesn't do
much<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.380> you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:41.100> more

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.380 
was called the fly pad how goes it let
you<00:01:59.369> fly<00:01:59.670> up<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> few<00:02:00.360> blocks<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:03.000> still

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you fly up a few blocks but it still

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.200 
you fly up a few blocks but it still
does<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.890> jump<00:02:05.219> ball<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> conveyor

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
does if you jump ball on the conveyor

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.380 
does if you jump ball on the conveyor
pod<00:02:06.479> you're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> fly<00:02:07.399> literally

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.900 

when<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> had<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.720> two<00:02:14.319> blocks<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:15.280> still<00:02:15.730> you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
when I had it two blocks you still you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.740 
when I had it two blocks you still you
take<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.240> lot<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:17.940> when<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:18.970> had<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.240> jump<00:02:19.510> height

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
take a lot of when I had to jump height

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.960 
take a lot of when I had to jump height
at<00:02:19.959> two<00:02:20.200> blocks<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.800> could<00:02:20.980> still<00:02:21.430> take<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> lot

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
at two blocks you could still take a lot

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.710 
at two blocks you could still take a lot
of<00:02:22.000> full<00:02:22.330> damage<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:25.030> wasn't<00:02:25.300> very<00:02:25.450> helpful

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
of full damage which wasn't very helpful

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.880 
of full damage which wasn't very helpful
only<00:02:28.720> problem<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> conveyor<00:02:29.410> blocks<00:02:29.709> is

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
only problem is the conveyor blocks is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.320 
only problem is the conveyor blocks is
you<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.130> place<00:02:30.340> another<00:02:30.550> block<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:30.940> top<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.209> it

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
you can place another block on top of it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.440 
you can place another block on top of it
I<00:02:32.610> mean<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.700> could<00:02:33.820> be<00:02:33.910> used<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.240> block

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
I mean that could be used as a block

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.470 
I mean that could be used as a block
actually<00:02:35.220> like<00:02:36.220> at<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.580> NA<00:02:36.880> put<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.209> block

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
