drill and today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:09.590> to<00:00:09.680> replace<00:00:09.950> one<00:00:10.250> of<00:00:10.370> these<00:00:10.520> now<00:00:10.790> what<00:00:11.000> is

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
how to replace one of these now what is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.959 
how to replace one of these now what is
that<00:00:11.180> this<00:00:12.020> is<00:00:12.260> a<00:00:12.320> shutoff<00:00:12.860> valve<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:13.610> if

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
that this is a shutoff valve and if

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.760 
that this is a shutoff valve and if
you've<00:00:14.120> got<00:00:14.299> one<00:00:14.539> that's<00:00:14.660> leaking<00:00:14.959> I'm<00:00:15.410> going

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
you've got one that's leaking I'm going

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.940 
you've got one that's leaking I'm going
to<00:00:15.830> show<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.070> how<00:00:16.280> to<00:00:16.309> replace<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:17.000> in<00:00:17.180> a<00:00:17.600> snap

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
to show you how to replace it in a snap

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.790 
to show you how to replace it in a snap
because<00:00:18.950> replacing<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:19.699> shut<00:00:19.940> off<00:00:19.970> valve<00:00:20.060> is

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
because replacing a shut off valve is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.850 
because replacing a shut off valve is
easier<00:00:21.800> than<00:00:22.190> you<00:00:22.520> think<00:00:22.910> let's<00:00:23.780> get<00:00:24.230> started

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
easier than you think let's get started

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.290 
easier than you think let's get started

always like to have more tools available
than<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.059> may<00:00:32.300> need<00:00:32.480> for<00:00:32.719> a<00:00:32.780> job<00:00:33.100> this<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.160> an

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
than I may need for a job this is an

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.720 
than I may need for a job this is an
adjustable<00:00:35.059> wrench<00:00:35.559> these<00:00:36.559> are<00:00:36.740> channellocks

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
adjustable wrench these are channellocks

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.120 
adjustable wrench these are channellocks
this<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:38.750> pipe<00:00:39.110> wrench<00:00:39.350> now<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.650> may<00:00:39.920> not

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
this is a pipe wrench now you may not

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.069 
this is a pipe wrench now you may not
have<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.400> pipe<00:00:40.730> wrench<00:00:41.000> but<00:00:41.240> I<00:00:41.270> got<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.600> tell<00:00:41.810> you

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
have a pipe wrench but I got to tell you

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.680 
have a pipe wrench but I got to tell you
you<00:00:42.440> may<00:00:42.860> want<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.370> get<00:00:43.550> one<00:00:43.790> after<00:00:44.030> today<00:00:44.540> I'm

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
you may want to get one after today I'm

you may want to get one after today I'm
going<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.840> show<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.020> how<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:45.320> works<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:45.770> why

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
going to show you how this works and why

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.690 
going to show you how this works and why
it's<00:00:46.100> valuable

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
it's valuable

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900 
it's valuable
these<00:00:47.390> are<00:00:47.690> tubing<00:00:48.200> cutters<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:49.130> is<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.370> large

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
these are tubing cutters this is a large

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.120 
these are tubing cutters this is a large
tubing<00:00:50.540> cutter<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:51.200> tubing<00:00:51.680> cutter<00:00:51.920> is

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
tubing cutter and this tubing cutter is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.819 
tubing cutter and this tubing cutter is
really<00:00:52.820> made<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.300> tight<00:00:53.540> spaces<00:00:54.380> okay<00:00:54.770> so

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
really made for tight spaces okay so

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.530 
really made for tight spaces okay so
here's<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> thing<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.970> have<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.120> shut<00:00:56.420> off

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
here's the thing you have to shut off

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.150 
here's the thing you have to shut off
the<00:00:56.660> water<00:00:56.690> first<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.829> would<00:00:57.980> really

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
the water first and I would really

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.130 
the water first and I would really
suggest<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.910> shut<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.360> water<00:00:59.600> off<00:00:59.750> at

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
suggest that you shut the water off at

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.590 
suggest that you shut the water off at
the<00:01:00.260> main<00:01:00.500> once<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.309> shut<00:01:01.550> off<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.880> water<00:01:01.910> you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the main once you shut off the water you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.439 
the main once you shut off the water you
want<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.020> go<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.380> lowest<00:01:03.680> possible<00:01:04.449> point

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
want to go to the lowest possible point

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.260 
want to go to the lowest possible point
in<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.780> house<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> slop<00:01:07.100> sink<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.700> turn

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
in the house like a slop sink and turn

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.630 
in the house like a slop sink and turn
the<00:01:08.540> cold<00:01:08.780> water<00:01:09.110> on<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.920> that's<00:01:10.400> going<00:01:10.580> to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the cold water on and that's going to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640 
the cold water on and that's going to
help<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:11.000> drain<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.540> water<00:01:11.720> out<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.380> line

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
help you drain the water out of the line

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.340 
help you drain the water out of the line
okay<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.520> we've<00:01:13.820> shut<00:01:14.000> off<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.299> water<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.840> now

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
okay so we've shut off the water and now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.990 
okay so we've shut off the water and now
it's<00:01:15.500> time<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.770> disconnect<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> water<00:01:16.820> supply

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it's time to disconnect the water supply

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.330 
it's time to disconnect the water supply
line<00:01:17.420> from<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.229> shutoff<00:01:18.560> valve<00:01:19.010> that's

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
line from the shutoff valve that's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.130 
line from the shutoff valve that's
attached<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.210> because<00:01:20.390> it's<00:01:20.540> attached<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
attached is because it's attached to the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.850 
attached is because it's attached to the
toilet<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.040> I'm<00:01:22.190> just<00:01:22.430> going<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.729> loosen<00:01:23.330> it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.020 

then<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> point<00:01:28.220> I'll<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.729> be<00:01:28.850> able<00:01:28.940> to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
then a point I'll just be able to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.400 
then a point I'll just be able to
unscrew<00:01:29.630> it

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.690 

okay<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:35.470> there<00:01:36.400> we<00:01:36.550> go<00:01:37.140> there<00:01:38.140> are<00:01:38.170> two<00:01:38.700> kinds

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
okay so there we go there are two kinds

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.820 
okay so there we go there are two kinds
of<00:01:39.760> shutoff<00:01:40.270> valves<00:01:40.720> there's<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.530> shot<00:01:41.800> of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
of shutoff valves there's a shot of

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.380 
of shutoff valves there's a shot of
valve<00:01:42.130> like<00:01:42.400> this<00:01:42.640> one<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.030> called<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
valve like this one it's called a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.420 
valve like this one it's called a
compression<00:01:43.750> fitting<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.830> all<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.280> to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
compression fitting and all we have to

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.780 
compression fitting and all we have to
do<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.820> loosen<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:47.170> nut<00:01:47.740> here<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.340> slide<00:01:48.640> it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
do is loosen this nut here and slide it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.360 
do is loosen this nut here and slide it
off<00:01:48.940> that's<00:01:49.180> all<00:01:49.300> there<00:01:49.480> is<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.720> it

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
off that's all there is to it

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.430 
off that's all there is to it
some<00:01:51.370> shutoff<00:01:51.940> valves<00:01:52.360> are<00:01:52.480> soldered<00:01:53.260> onto

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
some shutoff valves are soldered onto

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.340 
some shutoff valves are soldered onto
the<00:01:53.710> copper<00:01:53.920> pipe<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.120> in<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.420> case<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.260> have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the copper pipe so in that case you have

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.000 
the copper pipe so in that case you have
to<00:01:56.590> cut<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.190> off<00:01:57.340> I'm<00:01:58.300> going<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.170> show<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.440> how

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
to cut it off I'm going to show you how

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030 
to cut it off I'm going to show you how
to<00:02:00.040> remove<00:02:00.640> both<00:02:01.290> okay<00:02:02.290> now<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.980> a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
to remove both okay now this is a

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.380 
to remove both okay now this is a
compression<00:02:03.550> fitting<00:02:03.910> we're<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.330> to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
compression fitting we're going to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.540 
compression fitting we're going to
remove<00:02:04.660> it<00:02:04.870> and<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.320> easier<00:02:05.890> than<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.190> think

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
remove it and it's easier than you think

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
remove it and it's easier than you think
but<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.820> want<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.360> say<00:02:07.630> this<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.760> easy

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
but I want to say this it's so easy

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560 
but I want to say this it's so easy
anyone<00:02:11.560> could<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.190> this<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:13.180> don't<00:02:13.240> want

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
anyone could do this and I don't want

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.480 
anyone could do this and I don't want
you<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.020> intimidated<00:02:14.890> because<00:02:15.220> you're

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
you to be intimidated because you're

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.450 
you to be intimidated because you're
removing<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.480> valve<00:02:16.720> from<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.140> pipe<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.770> want<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
removing a valve from a pipe I want to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.080 
removing a valve from a pipe I want to
show<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.730> how<00:02:19.090> easy<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:20.790> okay<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:21.850> I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
show you how easy this is okay so I'm

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.440 
show you how easy this is okay so I'm
going<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.270> take<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.720> pipe<00:02:23.020> wrench<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:24.450> what

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
going to take this pipe wrench and what

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.330 
going to take this pipe wrench and what
I<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.690> about<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.080> is<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.410> works<00:02:26.710> like<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> vise

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
I like about it is it works like a vise

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.870 
I like about it is it works like a vise
and<00:02:27.640> I'm<00:02:27.850> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.090> slip<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.660> under<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and I'm going to slip it under the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.070 
and I'm going to slip it under the
shutoff<00:02:30.880> valve<00:02:31.210> just<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.540> hold<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.900> place

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
shutoff valve just to hold it in place

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.120 
shutoff valve just to hold it in place
while<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.190> loosen<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:37.030> nut<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:38.170> that's<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
while I loosen this nut here that's the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.070 
while I loosen this nut here that's the
compression<00:02:39.910> nut

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.390 

now<00:02:48.080> it's<00:02:48.319> loose<00:02:48.500> enough<00:02:48.560> just<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.099> do<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.250> by

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
now it's loose enough just to do it by

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.880 
now it's loose enough just to do it by
hand<00:02:51.880> guess<00:02:52.880> what<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.900> will<00:02:54.140> just<00:02:54.380> slip<00:02:54.650> off

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
hand guess what it will just slip off

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.229 
hand guess what it will just slip off
watch<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.930> that's<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:58.220> is<00:02:58.459> all<00:02:58.670> there

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
watch this that's it that is all there

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.140 
watch this that's it that is all there
is<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.170> okay<00:03:01.010> now<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> shutoff

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
is to it okay now if you have a shutoff

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.650 
is to it okay now if you have a shutoff
valve<00:03:02.480> that's<00:03:02.720> soldered<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:05.090> here's<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
valve that's soldered on then here's the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.870 
valve that's soldered on then here's the
thing<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.130> make<00:03:07.280> certain<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.730> you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
thing you have to make certain that you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.600 
thing you have to make certain that you
have<00:03:07.910> enough<00:03:08.630> space<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:09.349> don't<00:03:09.470> want<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:10.069> cut

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
have enough space you don't want to cut

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
have enough space you don't want to cut
off<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.819> pipe<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.380> don't<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.709> enough

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
off a pipe if you don't have enough

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.530 
off a pipe if you don't have enough
space<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.599> put<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.720> new<00:03:14.930> valve<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:16.459> if<00:03:16.819> you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
space to put the new valve on now if you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.860 
space to put the new valve on now if you
have<00:03:17.930> enough<00:03:18.560> space<00:03:19.250> then<00:03:20.180> you<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.510> cut<00:03:20.840> it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
have enough space then you can cut it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.740 
have enough space then you can cut it
off<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.350> slip<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> new<00:03:21.830> valve<00:03:22.069> on<00:03:22.600> but<00:03:23.600> if<00:03:23.690> you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
off and slip the new valve on but if you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.210 
off and slip the new valve on but if you
don't<00:03:23.989> then<00:03:24.470> you're<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.799> have<00:03:24.980> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
don't then you're going to have to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.470 
don't then you're going to have to
solder<00:03:25.549> on<00:03:26.000> another<00:03:26.900> pipe<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:28.390> there's<00:03:29.390> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
solder on another pipe and there's a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.050 
solder on another pipe and there's a
video<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.830> sea<00:03:31.099> general<00:03:31.760> plumbing

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
video in the sea general plumbing

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
video in the sea general plumbing
section<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:33.080> shows<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.500> how<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.709> cut<00:03:34.099> and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
section that shows you how to cut and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.550 
section that shows you how to cut and
solder<00:03:34.849> pipe<00:03:35.260> now<00:03:36.260> your<00:03:37.040> choices<00:03:37.400> are<00:03:37.819> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
solder pipe now your choices are the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.640 
solder pipe now your choices are the
conventional<00:03:39.560> large<00:03:40.160> um<00:03:41.170> tubing<00:03:42.170> header<00:03:42.349> it's

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
conventional large um tubing header it's

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.440 
conventional large um tubing header it's
too<00:03:42.980> large<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.580> too<00:03:43.760> large<00:03:43.940> for<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.239> tight

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
too large it's too large for a tight

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.539 
too large it's too large for a tight
area<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.920> we're<00:03:46.130> going<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.310> use<00:03:46.519> a

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
area like that so we're going to use a

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.539 
area like that so we're going to use a
smaller<00:03:47.060> one<00:03:47.450> which<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.230> great<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:48.799> confined

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
smaller one which is great for confined

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.960 
smaller one which is great for confined
space<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:51.170> don't<00:03:51.380> be<00:03:51.590> intimidated<00:03:51.709> by<00:03:52.340> any<00:03:52.730> of

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
space so don't be intimidated by any of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.289 
space so don't be intimidated by any of
these<00:03:53.090> tools<00:03:53.359> because<00:03:53.720> they're<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.320> easy<00:03:55.299> to

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
these tools because they're so easy to

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.569 
these tools because they're so easy to
use<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:56.989> there's<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.440> video<00:03:57.739> for<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:58.220> okay

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
use and there's a video for it okay

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.910 
use and there's a video for it okay
right<00:03:58.850> there<00:03:59.329> on<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.480> CJ<00:03:59.840> and<00:03:59.989> drill<00:04:00.440> website

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
right there on the CJ and drill website

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.580 
right there on the CJ and drill website
so<00:04:01.489> okay<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:01.940> it's<00:04:02.269> in<00:04:02.420> place<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.049> now<00:04:03.500> I'm

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
so okay so it's in place and now I'm

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.229 
so okay so it's in place and now I'm
just<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:03.950> cut<00:04:04.250> I'm<00:04:04.730> just<00:04:04.910> going<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.090> cut

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
just going to cut I'm just going to cut

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.960 
just going to cut I'm just going to cut
the<00:04:05.329> shutoff<00:04:05.540> valve<00:04:05.870> off

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.949 

and<00:04:13.660> that's<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.500> nice<00:04:15.370> clean-cut<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.780> just

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
and that's it nice clean-cut and it just

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.050 
and that's it nice clean-cut and it just
takes<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.230> second<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:17.890> we<00:04:17.920> have<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> choice<00:04:18.850> of

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
takes a second so we have a choice of

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.290 
takes a second so we have a choice of
two<00:04:19.260> shutoff<00:04:20.260> valves<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.730> a<00:04:21.760> compression

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
two shutoff valves this is a compression

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.630 
two shutoff valves this is a compression
fitting<00:04:22.780> like<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.560> one<00:04:23.800> we<00:04:23.980> just<00:04:24.010> took<00:04:24.370> off

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
fitting like the one we just took off

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.690 
fitting like the one we just took off
now<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:25.510> will<00:04:25.720> say<00:04:25.930> it's<00:04:26.680> easy<00:04:26.920> this<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.400> called

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
now I will say it's easy this is called

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.970 
now I will say it's easy this is called
a<00:04:27.760> push<00:04:28.030> fit<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.230> push<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.800> the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
a push fit and you just push it on the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.180 
a push fit and you just push it on the
pipe<00:04:30.190> that's<00:04:30.730> all<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.540> takes<00:04:31.810> now<00:04:32.170> I<00:04:32.680> do<00:04:32.830> want

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
pipe that's all it takes now I do want

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.280 
pipe that's all it takes now I do want
to<00:04:33.250> say<00:04:33.430> something<00:04:33.460> about<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.240> old<00:04:34.540> shutoff

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
to say something about the old shutoff

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.670 
to say something about the old shutoff
valve<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:36.370> can<00:04:36.400> go<00:04:36.640> with<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.880> old<00:04:37.680> shutoff

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
valve you can go with the old shutoff

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760 
valve you can go with the old shutoff
valve<00:04:38.980> but<00:04:39.250> these<00:04:39.400> things<00:04:39.640> they<00:04:40.290> they<00:04:41.290> really

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
valve but these things they they really

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.670 
valve but these things they they really
they<00:04:41.950> wear<00:04:42.190> out<00:04:42.220> easily<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.120> that's<00:04:44.050> why<00:04:44.380> I'm

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
they wear out easily and that's why I'm

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.830 
they wear out easily and that's why I'm
suggesting<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.180> get<00:04:46.420> what's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
suggesting to you that you get what's

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.650 
suggesting to you that you get what's
called<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.230> quarter<00:04:47.800> turn<00:04:48.360> shutoff<00:04:49.360> valve

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
called a quarter turn shutoff valve

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.340 
called a quarter turn shutoff valve
that's<00:04:50.230> really<00:04:50.770> your<00:04:50.920> best<00:04:51.070> bet<00:04:51.990> okay<00:04:52.990> now<00:04:53.140> if

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
that's really your best bet okay now if

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.340 
that's really your best bet okay now if
you've<00:04:53.620> cut<00:04:54.610> off<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:55.060> soldered<00:04:56.970> shutoff<00:04:57.970> valve

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
you've cut off a soldered shutoff valve

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.780 
you've cut off a soldered shutoff valve
you<00:04:59.350> can<00:04:59.380> put<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> compression<00:05:00.160> fitting<00:05:00.490> back

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
you can put a compression fitting back

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.600 
you can put a compression fitting back
on<00:05:01.030> one<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.080> push<00:05:02.320> fits<00:05:02.620> back<00:05:02.890> on<00:05:03.130> you

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
on one of the push fits back on you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.400 
on one of the push fits back on you
don't<00:05:03.790> have<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.060> solder<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.510> back<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:04.960> and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
don't have to solder it back on and

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.080 
don't have to solder it back on and
that's<00:05:05.950> what<00:05:06.100> we're<00:05:06.250> doing<00:05:06.370> here<00:05:06.700> we're

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
that's what we're doing here we're

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.890 
that's what we're doing here we're
taking<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.840> easiest<00:05:08.590> route<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:10.270> putting<00:05:10.540> on

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
taking the easiest route to putting on

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.110 
taking the easiest route to putting on
shutoff<00:05:11.650> valve<00:05:11.920> okay<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.760> want<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.030> make

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
shutoff valve okay so you want to make

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.450 
shutoff valve okay so you want to make
certain<00:05:13.420> at<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.660> exposed<00:05:14.260> pipe<00:05:14.620> is<00:05:14.920> clean<00:05:15.250> of

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
certain at the exposed pipe is clean of

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.580 
certain at the exposed pipe is clean of
debris<00:05:15.490> mixer<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.630> there's<00:05:16.810> no<00:05:16.960> oil<00:05:16.990> or

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
debris mixer that there's no oil or

Emery<00:05:26.530> cloth<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.460> want<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.730> take<00:05:27.880> the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
Emery cloth so you want to take the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.320 
Emery cloth so you want to take the
compression<00:05:29.740> nut<00:05:29.860> slide<00:05:30.280> it<00:05:30.460> on<00:05:30.610> you're<00:05:31.180> going

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
compression nut slide it on you're going

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.030 
compression nut slide it on you're going
to<00:05:31.390> slide<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.140> brass<00:05:32.410> washer<00:05:33.280> in<00:05:33.370> place<00:05:35.040> like

to slide the brass washer in place like
that<00:05:36.280> back<00:05:36.490> on<00:05:36.700> there<00:05:36.910> now<00:05:37.390> we're<00:05:37.600> going<00:05:37.690> to

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
that back on there now we're going to

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.170 
that back on there now we're going to
take<00:05:37.990> our<00:05:38.230> shutoff<00:05:38.620> valve<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:39.850> we're<00:05:40.060> going

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
take our shutoff valve and we're going

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.909 
take our shutoff valve and we're going
to<00:05:40.240> slide<00:05:40.510> that<00:05:40.750> on<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.320> then<00:05:41.710> we're<00:05:41.890> just

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
to slide that on and then we're just

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.480 
to slide that on and then we're just
going<00:05:42.160> to<00:05:42.220> tighten<00:05:42.610> our<00:05:43.919> compression<00:05:44.919> nut<00:05:47.490> you

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
going to tighten our compression nut you

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.650 
going to tighten our compression nut you
want<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.730> do<00:05:48.790> it<00:05:48.880> by<00:05:48.970> hand<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.450> get<00:05:49.570> it

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
want to do it by hand just to get it

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.860 
want to do it by hand just to get it
started<00:05:49.990> once<00:05:50.380> it<00:05:50.560> started<00:05:51.090> that's<00:05:52.090> good<00:05:52.390> now

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
started once it started that's good now

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.090 
started once it started that's good now
it's<00:05:53.110> time<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.980> put<00:05:54.250> on<00:05:54.430> our<00:05:55.440> pipe<00:05:56.440> wrench<00:05:56.710> and

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
it's time to put on our pipe wrench and

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.010 
it's time to put on our pipe wrench and
we'll<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.520> place<00:05:57.760> that<00:05:57.790> on<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.240> bottom<00:05:58.660> like

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
we'll just place that on the bottom like

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.690 
we'll just place that on the bottom like
so<00:05:59.290> that's<00:05:59.680> going<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.010> hold<00:06:00.760> this<00:06:01.270> um<00:06:02.700> it's

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
so that's going to hold this um it's

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.370 
so that's going to hold this um it's
going<00:06:03.820> to<00:06:03.910> hold<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.270> shutoff<00:06:04.570> valve<00:06:04.840> in<00:06:05.110> place

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
going to hold the shutoff valve in place

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.330 
going to hold the shutoff valve in place
while<00:06:06.040> we<00:06:06.340> tighten<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.570> compression<00:06:08.230> nut<00:06:08.410> now

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
while we tighten the compression nut now

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.500 
while we tighten the compression nut now
one<00:06:09.700> thing<00:06:09.880> that<00:06:10.000> I<00:06:10.030> want<00:06:10.240> to<00:06:10.300> say<00:06:10.419> about

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
one thing that I want to say about

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.190 
one thing that I want to say about
tightening<00:06:11.260> you<00:06:11.950> want<00:06:12.220> to<00:06:12.370> give<00:06:12.520> it<00:06:12.669> at<00:06:12.880> least

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
tightening you want to give it at least

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.320 
tightening you want to give it at least
half<00:06:14.200> of<00:06:14.410> a<00:06:14.530> turn<00:06:14.740> and<00:06:15.160> doesn't<00:06:15.880> sound<00:06:16.120> like

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
half of a turn and doesn't sound like

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.300 
half of a turn and doesn't sound like
very<00:06:16.360> much<00:06:16.840> but<00:06:17.350> with<00:06:17.560> this<00:06:17.710> compression

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
very much but with this compression

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.070 
very much but with this compression
fitting<00:06:18.700> is<00:06:18.850> going<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.450> get<00:06:19.570> really<00:06:19.840> tight

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
fitting is going to get really tight

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.440 
fitting is going to get really tight
real<00:06:20.320> quick

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
real quick
