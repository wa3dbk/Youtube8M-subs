00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.750
 or the taxi if you're a guitarist 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.360
 beginner the safest thing is that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 you want to make solo melodies improvise 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.500
 on bases and do not know where to start 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.270
 Well, a good start is Pattern 1 of 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.520
 the pentatonic scale the scale 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.600
 pentatonic is the most universal one that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.309
 use all and I'll explain the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.010
 most used figure of the pentatonic 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.680
 which is figure 11 or I like 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.320
 call it pattern 1 because there are some 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.550
 more but the 1 is the most important and it is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.500
 the basic 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.400
 so we're going there 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.440
 It is important to know what 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.750
 in the pattern the patterns of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 pentatonic you do not learn the pattern 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.900
 according to the number of in fret fret 5 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:10.260
 fret 8 you do not learn the pattern according to 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:13.320
 the finger you step on is to say finger 1 2 3 4 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.730
 let's take as an example 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.920
 pentatonic sun 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.200
 then I will explain the difference between 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.560
 minor and major 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.260
 G minor 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.970
 we look for the sixth string the note 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.240
 in this case fret 3 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.950
 and explained the pattern 1 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 sixth string 1 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.890
 how do you see if a fingering fingering 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:51.050
 logic 123 one finger per fret comes to us 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:02:00.610
 sixth rope one rope 13 13 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:00.610
 from the rope and first one 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.660
 the six strings 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.410
 and now from 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.710
 and 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.090
 ah 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.910
 well this pattern independently of 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.190
 the note is what will be useful for you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.930
 touch on the base 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 what happens if a song or a section of 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.460
 she is in a major key post there 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.240
 a trick 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.460
 imagine you are in C major so 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.230
 example as always is this rope 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.090
 we look for the dow the 2 is the fret 8 here 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.080
 if it is more what we do we 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.080
 to step on it with the little finger 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.920
 we complete the hand the logical fingering 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.400
 and we see that the index of the one is 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.709
 stepping on one side 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.560
 that is to say the C major and with the index 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.840
 because that is a relative minor you with the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.780
 pentatonic you always have to look for the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.120
 minor and if it is greater or lesser and if 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.939
 it's so minor you leave it as it is if 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.939
 it was good there is less 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 if it is so much bigger you use the trick of 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.840
 little finger to do so and it turns out that his 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.180
 relative minor is the side ie do 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.260
 greater the minor 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.379
 two years is to say 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.319
 without two years the danger came then 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:08.069
 figure one started playing on the dow 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.069
 figures 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.310
 for example I am older 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.480
 greater sun as we said bigger pinky 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.220
 and in this case we see that the finger 1 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.200
 matches the 0 fret of all the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.270
 strings logically here we are not going to 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.960
 use these fingers because it would be a 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.880
 discomfort 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.769
 so for convenience we use these 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.569
 fingers 

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:42.050
 single 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.050
 Y 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.710
 and has no more pattern 1 forever and ever 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 What I'm going to do is I'm going to make you 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.490
 a base in minor or minor sun 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.959
 so you can practice this pattern 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:08.189
 well-known and that you are going to use all 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:08.189
 life we go to go 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.509
 do not 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.759
 do not 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.930
 ah 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.940
 and 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.090
 ah 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 ah 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600
 ah 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.400
