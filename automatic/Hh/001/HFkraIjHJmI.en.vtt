00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
there and take some bumps and you know

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.110 
there and take some bumps and you know
work<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> young<00:00:46.320> kids<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.120> he

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
work with some of the young kids but he

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.700 
work with some of the young kids but he
didn't<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> put<00:00:48.840> his<00:00:48.960> body<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
didn't have to put his body through the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
didn't have to put his body through the
kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.039> stress<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.640> would<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:50.940> he

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
kind of stress that he would if he

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.549 
kind of stress that he would if he
actually<00:00:51.210> came<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.780> full<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> think

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
actually came back full time I think

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
actually came back full time I think
he'd<00:00:52.829> probably<00:00:52.860> enjoyed<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> aspect<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
he'd probably enjoyed that aspect of it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
he'd probably enjoyed that aspect of it
too<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.860> asked<00:00:56.219> him<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
too so I think if they asked him and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
too so I think if they asked him and
they<00:00:56.730> brought<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> back<00:00:57.210> i<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.690> he<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:57.989> do

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
they brought it back i think he would do

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
they brought it back i think he would do
it<00:00:58.320> he<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.559> fit<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.100> his<00:00:59.280> schedule<00:00:59.309> yeah
