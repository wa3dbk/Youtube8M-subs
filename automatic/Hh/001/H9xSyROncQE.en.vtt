00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
like funny little drama things but it
wasn't<00:01:35.009> necessarily<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:36.000> something<00:01:36.689> deep

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
wasn't necessarily like something deep

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
wasn't necessarily like something deep
and<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.310> John<00:01:38.610> greeting<00:01:39.150> or

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and it's not like John greeting or

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.760 
and it's not like John greeting or
anything<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.530> nice

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
anything like that so it was like nice

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
anything like that so it was like nice
and<00:01:41.009> light<00:01:41.189> hearted<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.850> liked<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and light hearted and I liked that I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.480 
and light hearted and I liked that I
like<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.530> book<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> wasn't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
like that about this book and it wasn't

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
like that about this book and it wasn't
like<00:01:44.579> overly<00:01:45.090> dramatic<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.170> teen

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like overly dramatic like some teen

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
like overly dramatic like some teen
books<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.250> think<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> right

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
books can be I think it was the right

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
books can be I think it was the right
level<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> think<00:01:49.110> she<00:01:49.229> picked<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> like

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
level and I think she picked the like

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
level and I think she picked the like
the<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.119> guess<00:01:51.689> places<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.619> her

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the right I guess places to take her

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
the right I guess places to take her
characters<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:54.149> far<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.899> st.<00:01:55.350> Clair<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
characters as far as like st. Clair and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399 
characters as far as like st. Clair and
Anna<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:57.210> their<00:01:57.390> whole<00:01:57.570> relationship<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
Anna I'm in their whole relationship I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.200 
Anna I'm in their whole relationship I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
good relationship it wasn't necessary

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.229
