00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.749
 Otherwise, as easy in the beginning, I took my time for safety, though 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.589
 Kamikaze would also be moderate 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.589

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
 15 minutes per share stood an even faster 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.990
 you can wait so, yes 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.029
 just as when the vehicles leads to allowing clubs to be displayed 

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:39.029
 provided the vehicles indicated which one must search 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.940
 that was with catfish looks so different ladies rescue then you would have to know the 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.110
 the dealership counts 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.969
