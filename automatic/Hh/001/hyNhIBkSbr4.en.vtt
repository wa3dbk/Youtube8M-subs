okay let's get back to the sea pot so
here's<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.469> flour<00:01:45.649> white<00:01:46.250> flour<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:47.390> flour

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
here's the flour white flour the flour

so this is a see here kind of brownish
color<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:54.140> Brown<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:58.430> kind<00:02:58.549> of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
color and that Brown it's what kind of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880 
color and that Brown it's what kind of
shape<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:59.000> don't<00:02:59.269> know<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.140> it's<00:03:00.260> not<00:03:00.440> round

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
shape I don't know but it's not round

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.280 
shape I don't know but it's not round
like<00:03:01.340> an<00:03:01.940> okra<00:03:02.739> seeds<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:05.060> irregular<00:03:05.930> let's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
like an okra seeds it's irregular let's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.339 
like an okra seeds it's irregular let's
put<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.680> way<00:03:06.859> okay<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.079> is<00:03:09.230> the

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
put that way okay so this is the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.770 
put that way okay so this is the
sequence<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.609> pot<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:11.030> inside

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
sequence this is the pot here inside

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.870 
sequence this is the pot here inside
that<00:03:11.959> when<00:03:12.139> you<00:03:12.230> peel<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.530> open<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:13.700> quite

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
that when you peel it open it quite

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.539 
that when you peel it open it quite
easily<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.239> peel<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.569> open<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.340> comes

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
easily to peel it open and here comes

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.539 
easily to peel it open and here comes
the<00:03:16.790> seat

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
the seat

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.089 
the seat
definitely<00:03:19.549> I<00:03:19.579> would<00:03:19.700> try<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.620> regrow<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.859> in

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
definitely I would try to regrow this in

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.009 
definitely I would try to regrow this in
the<00:03:22.220> springtime<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:25.609> over<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.720> summers

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
the springtime it's over the summers

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.250 
the springtime it's over the summers
closed<00:03:27.500> between<00:03:27.919> in<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.630> I'll<00:03:30.079> probably

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
closed between in there so I'll probably

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.289 
closed between in there so I'll probably
trying<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.739> begin<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.190> grow<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.549> from<00:03:31.940> seed

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
trying to begin to grow this from seed

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.539 
trying to begin to grow this from seed
in<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.810> springtime<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.510> see<00:03:35.510> how<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.720> plant

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
in the springtime and see how to plant

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:43.110 
in the springtime and see how to plant
the<00:03:37.549> Sun<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.690> springtime<00:03:40.060> okay<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:42.290> that's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the Sun in the springtime okay so that's

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.449 
the Sun in the springtime okay so that's
my<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.569> guess<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.139> would<00:03:45.290> say<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.620> final<00:03:45.829> well

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
my I guess I would say the final well

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.140 
my I guess I would say the final well
not<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.940> find<00:03:47.120> out<00:03:47.329> video<00:03:47.630> an<00:03:47.780> old<00:03:47.959> soy<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.970> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
not to find out video an old soy but I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.740 
not to find out video an old soy but I
will<00:03:50.660> make<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:50.959> more<00:03:51.019> video

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
will make one more video

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.240 
will make one more video
grow<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.849> seeds<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:56.200> next<00:03:57.129> time

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
grow this with the seeds and next time

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.850 
grow this with the seeds and next time
I'll<00:03:57.430> fire<00:03:57.700> triangle<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.870> ground<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.590> see

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
I'll fire triangle in the ground and see

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.420 
I'll fire triangle in the ground and see
