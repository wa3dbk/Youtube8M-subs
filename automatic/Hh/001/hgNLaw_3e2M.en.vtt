has kind of researched it and seen a lot

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
has kind of researched it and seen a lot
of<00:00:45.840> studies<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.410> show<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.680> nuts<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.489> fact

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of studies that show that nuts in fact

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
of studies that show that nuts in fact
make<00:00:48.329> our<00:00:48.510> waistline<00:00:48.930> slimmer<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> there's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
make our waistline slimmer and there's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
make our waistline slimmer and there's
nothing<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.969> nuts<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> weight<00:00:51.629> gain
