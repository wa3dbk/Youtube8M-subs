couple ceremonial pace laps around

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.280 
couple ceremonial pace laps around
before<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> race<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.170> great

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
before the race so that should be great

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040

as<00:00:43.500> well<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.510> far<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> race

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050

itself<00:00:46.489> after<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.789> those<00:00:47.940> emotional

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
itself after all those emotional

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
itself after all those emotional
tributes<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> Chevy's<00:00:49.739> will

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
tributes I think that Chevy's will

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
tributes I think that Chevy's will
probably<00:00:50.280> dominate<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.270> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
probably dominate I don't think that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.850 
probably dominate I don't think that
would<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> surprised<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.379> they

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
would be surprised because they

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
would be surprised because they
qualified<00:00:53.610> nine<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> top<00:00:54.420> 10<00:00:54.710> Josef

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
qualified nine out of the top 10 Josef

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010 
qualified nine out of the top 10 Josef
Newgarden<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> only<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.360> driver<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Newgarden was the only on the driver in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
Newgarden was the only on the driver in
the<00:00:58.170> top<00:00:58.350> ten<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> be

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the top ten and so that's going to be

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
the top ten and so that's going to be
disappointment<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> four-time<00:01:01.949> Series

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
last three titles and I just don't think

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
last three titles and I just don't think
that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> Ganassi<00:01:07.830> cars<00:01:08.220> will<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that the Ganassi cars will be much of a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
that the Ganassi cars will be much of a
factor<00:01:09.030> unless<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.510> use<00:01:09.689> some<00:01:09.900> sort<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> fuel

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
factor unless they use some sort of fuel

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
factor unless they use some sort of fuel
strategy<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.060> leaves<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
strategy and that really leaves the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
strategy and that really leaves the

Castroneves<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

Castroneves are going to be the
favorites<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.320> opinion<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.700> think

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
favorites in my opinion and I think

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730

ultimately<00:01:30.329> Elio<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> come<00:01:31.590> away

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
ultimately Elio is going to come away

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.200 
ultimately Elio is going to come away
with<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.040> they'll<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> split<00:01:32.759> strategy

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
with it they'll be on a split strategy

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
with it they'll be on a split strategy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to make sure their bases are covered but

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.910 
to make sure their bases are covered but
I<00:01:35.369> anticipate<00:01:36.119> elio<00:01:36.479> winning<00:01:37.409> based<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> his

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I anticipate elio winning based on his

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
I anticipate elio winning based on his
experience<00:01:38.520> there's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> drivers<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
