00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 measures that are usually taken with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.530
 look to be of the electoral process have 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 fewer disruptive factors scattered 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 for example one is what it is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.760
 the temporary suspension of the carriage and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.729

 fire throughout the national territory in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 Article 2 of this same resolution 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.610
 talks about some exceptions that are 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.160
 related to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.150
 a security body with security 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.090
 diplomatic and other elements that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.200
 you always want in article 3 we are 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.700
 making the suspension of the one that prohibits 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.840

 tascas bars restaurants shows 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.580
 public discos and others and here 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 I want to make fundamental emphasis because 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.370
 this the maturity of the Venezuelan people 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 you have to be aware of this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.800
 provision so important because it is 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.050
 the prohibition that many seek 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.050
 some way be made of drinks 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.700
 alcoholics thinking that the celebration 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.500
 or that a weekend without a drink 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.709
 alcoholic an impossible weekend 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.959
 impossible to have a good time that we 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.280
 let's do well careful in the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.500
 execution 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.290
 resolution in taking the measures of 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.260
 patrol supervision of closure of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.830
 the premises where we discover that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.990
 they are doing the sale of drinks 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.510
 alcoholic and alcoholic species in 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.540
 this case another article that is article 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.420
 4 prohibits throughout the national territory 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.819
 the meetings and public demonstrations 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.220
 concentrations of people or any 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.950
 similar act that may affect the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.569
 electoral process there will be some that will 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.610
 do and that do not affect then it 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.950
 reader but I wanted you to be able 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.510

 6 pm 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.239
 here I call on the groups of 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.739

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.900

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.430
 country and that must be complied with 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.239
 equally we all maintain the actions 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.980
 for such sic and article 5 speaks of the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.220
 quartering of segi bodies 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:51.610
 of police and security organs 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.400
 citizen who forgive the article 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.900
 5 order the bodies to the bodies of 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.970
 police and the organs ensure 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.010
 citizen to act forcefully 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.960
 in case this provision is violated 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.510
 on the other hand in article 6 it 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.780
 prohibits what circulation is 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.090
 Cargo vehicles over 35 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.370
 tons in the national territory 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.440
 from this October 26 to the day 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.989
 Monday 8 at six in the afternoon 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.080
 This measure also seeks can 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.600
 minimize the impacts they have on the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.550
 national transit the large amount of 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.070
 gandolas that move to the territory 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.840
 national there are some exceptions 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.900
 related to the transfer of medicines 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.640
 with cargo food transfer 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.610
 refrigerated however in the meeting 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.350
 logistics we did on Saturday as 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.330
 we indicate to the ministers with 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.270
 competencies that they will seek to make 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.640
 planning to minimize that during 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.350
 those days are also made 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.390
 movements of heavy vehicles without 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.760
 need to take the forecasts 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.220
 to also have a circle one 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.090
 national circulation that is more 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.160
 fluid 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.800
 that is perceived because that helps a lot 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.960
 see that green transit has decreased 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.340
 that there is no noise in the streets that does not 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.260
 of the concentrations that there is not 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.940
 sale of alcoholic drinks that 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.760
 greatly reduces tensions 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.940
 pressures and gives a tranquility to 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.330
 Venezuelan people 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.460
 It also prohibits the effect of 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.280
 security of what is the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.490
 the displacement of armored trucks 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.270
 of values to avoid some kind of 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.979
 criminal actions that could tarnish 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.430
 the electoral process in a moment 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.430
 determined
