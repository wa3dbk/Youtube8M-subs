read 32 degrees if it does not you can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
read 32 degrees if it does not you can
use<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.410> nut<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.190> bottom<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.759> adjust<00:02:09.149> it

use the nut on the bottom to adjust it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260 
use the nut on the bottom to adjust it
so<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.570> does<00:02:09.840> read<00:02:10.080> 32<00:02:10.470> degrees<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.880> check<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
so it does read 32 degrees to check that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270 
so it does read 32 degrees to check that
your<00:02:12.420> turkey<00:02:12.990> has<00:02:13.530> reached<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> correct
