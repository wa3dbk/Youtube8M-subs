but if you plan on playing this series
you'd<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.160> doing<00:00:41.400> yourself<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.880> great

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you'd be doing yourself a great

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:56.370 
you'd be doing yourself a great
disservice<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.720> skip<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.410> game

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.570 

graphically<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.560> game<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.920> bit<00:00:58.130> of<00:00:58.220> a<00:00:58.280> mix

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
graphically the game is a bit of a mix

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.000 
graphically the game is a bit of a mix
but<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.060> find<00:00:59.330> it<00:00:59.420> overall<00:00:59.690> pleasing<00:01:00.290> I'm<00:01:00.920> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
but I find it overall pleasing I'm a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.370 
but I find it overall pleasing I'm a
huge<00:01:01.280> fan<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.580> 2d<00:01:02.030> sprite-based<00:01:02.390> graphics<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
huge fan of 2d sprite-based graphics and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.990 
huge fan of 2d sprite-based graphics and
this<00:01:03.560> game<00:01:03.740> for<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.070> most<00:01:04.220> part<00:01:04.520> does<00:01:04.850> them

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
this game for the most part does them

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.180 
this game for the most part does them
pretty<00:01:05.210> well<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:05.840> menus<00:01:06.170> are<00:01:06.350> kind<00:01:06.710> of<00:01:06.800> crappy

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
pretty well the menus are kind of crappy

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.070 
pretty well the menus are kind of crappy
however<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.790> one<00:01:08.030> thing<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.360> dislike<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.960> that

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
however and one thing I dislike is that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.270 
however and one thing I dislike is that
your<00:01:09.200> room<00:01:09.380> spells<00:01:09.740> don't<00:01:09.890> have<00:01:10.100> any

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
when you're out of battle you have to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.560 
when you're out of battle you have to
either<00:01:13.430> use<00:01:13.729> them<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.000> find<00:01:14.180> out<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.420> they<00:01:14.510> do

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570

or<00:01:14.930> look<00:01:15.290> up<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.500> information<00:01:16.040> online

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.920 

like<00:01:44.190> most<00:01:44.430> RPGs<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.240> has<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> turn-based

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.430 

duels<00:04:18.880> are<00:04:19.180> one<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.660> my<00:04:19.750> favorite<00:04:20.260> features

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440

basically you have attack defend and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.840 
basically you have attack defend and
desperate<00:04:25.870> attack<00:04:26.110> attack<00:04:27.100> beats<00:04:27.400> defend

defend beats desperate attack and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.760 
defend beats desperate attack and
desperate<00:04:30.310> acts<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:31.060> regular<00:04:31.600> attacks<00:04:31.930> only

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
in duels you have to guess what the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.140 
in duels you have to guess what the
enemy<00:04:35.530> will<00:04:35.650> do<00:04:35.830> based<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> comment<00:04:37.000> they

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
enemy will do based on the comment they

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.210 
enemy will do based on the comment they
give<00:04:37.390> a<00:04:37.630> four-year<00:04:38.140> term<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.950> it's<00:04:39.100> almost

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
give a four-year term so it's almost

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.510 
give a four-year term so it's almost
like<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.820> game<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.840> wits<00:04:41.140> which<00:04:41.830> makes<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.280> lot
