00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 hi all friends send provider yahoo today we will go review 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.599
 one of the most difficult games on the level today implements the game in question is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.899
 crisis against 2 available in appstore at the price of 79 cents 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's see then and the characteristics of this game 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.029
 soon magic if the software house 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.510
 which we will see immediately 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.360
 the main menu 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.330
 main menu consisting of 6 connect lady 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.840
 window make still play 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.350
 shop 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.860
 x is our virtual store 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.070
 Where are we going to go 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 to empower our characters 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 so we can 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 to improve the life of the saint 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.590
 or m the defensive power with which diet 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.970
 to buy these upgrades 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.049
 we need as we are remembered above 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.810
 to the right 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.010
 d in this case 250 coins and 25 diamonds 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.300
 and the diamond coins available to us therefore those we have 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.390
 at this time there are 178 and 13 so it is not possible to buy 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 no power 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.829
 then we have because it's a section 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.829
 share video tutorials that allow us to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.550
 how to play 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.740
 We will have seven very simple settings 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.070
 not just the ability to enable or disable 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.830
 the sound is the vibration 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.700
 in addition also d 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.770
 present completely game 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 you last is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 sharing scores with the game center platform 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.250
 and about arras simply information about others 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.970
 background of the software house 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.209
 let us therefore go to play deployment 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.559
 identity is a horizontal scrolling game 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.019
 and we will have to go to alam 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 to check at the same time 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.309
 2 characters running 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.249
 now anyway let's go immediately to see 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.859
 in what it consists 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.959
 quickly compound game 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 from a4 olive-trees 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.169
 in turn 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.439
 in turn the teen 16 stages were subdivided 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.729
 in addition we have 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.079
 and andres bertol 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.789
 who is basically a but a single level where we will go 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:54.009
 to beat the same as we should reach 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.559
 we will 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.429
 rt possible distance 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.099
 let us therefore go to see 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.099
 the game 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.900
 let's take this level where 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.239
 more or less 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.799
 there is the possibility to review everything here 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.609
 at the beginning of each level we will have this tutorial that will explain us what 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.099
 I had to do so in this case we will have to be careful 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.340
 to these posted there that they will present themselves in front 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.969
 in this case they are 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.499
 some trees 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.329
 that film or from top to bottom 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.359
 we will also have 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.779
 also other trees 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:41.949
 xke will instead be from the bottom upwards and as you go forward 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.949
 with the game there will also be friends who will come 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.879
 let's see then 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.879
 what the game looks like 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.699
 who we are 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.139
 we will have to be careful this case we collect 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 Cremona 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.739
 now me 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 I will make two characters die in such a way that 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.309
 now I can briefly explain the game screen 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.319
 that we will present ourselves 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.639
 in place 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.350
 on the left we will have life will be a bar 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.009
 long red 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 rt that though now 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:44.689
 a solar 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.499
 this means what it means that in these two characters they will have life in 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:49.389
 common 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.650
 therefore if 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.080
 one of them should lose his life 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.699
 in turn the other character 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.099
 but then it will lose 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.620
 we should be very careful 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.029
 to 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.319
 dream be careful to avoid all the obstacles you are there 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.779
 they will present in front 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.150
 before 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.300
 all to avoid dying finish this level 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.589
 at the top right we have 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.059
 the number of diamonds collected and coins 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.559
 and the menu to pause 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.210
 so now we can go back to the main menu 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 I play this game or recommend it 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.380
 walter sperem fans of 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.689
 of difficult commitments as you could see 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.689
 f 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:48.699
 you have to give your own proof 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.029
 of the night of our abilities 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.800
 even with your fingers 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.350
 precisely because we're going to control these two characters 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.740
 on our screen 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.630
 sodium I greet you and I remember today follow us on our channels feisbuk e
