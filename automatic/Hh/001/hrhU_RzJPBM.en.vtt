features<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.540> car<00:02:17.750> actually<00:02:18.710> before<00:02:18.860> we

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
features of this car actually before we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.890 
features of this car actually before we
get<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.700> touch<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.300> it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

got<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.260> slit<00:02:21.560> through<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> bonnet<00:02:22.250> here

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
got this slit through the bonnet here

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.360 
got this slit through the bonnet here
which<00:02:23.270> sucks<00:02:23.720> air<00:02:23.930> through<00:02:23.990> over<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> engine

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
which sucks air through over the engine

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.860 
which sucks air through over the engine
and<00:02:25.580> comes<00:02:25.730> back<00:02:26.000> out<00:02:26.150> through<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
and comes back out through here and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.600 
and comes back out through here and
you've<00:02:27.260> also<00:02:27.410> got<00:02:27.590> these<00:02:27.920> vents<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.490> can

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
you've also got these vents that you can

you've also got these vents that you can
just<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.660> pull<00:02:29.870> engine<00:02:30.110> up<00:02:30.230> all

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
just see here that pull engine up all

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
just see here that pull engine up all

industry<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.430> let's<00:02:59.240> see<00:02:59.390> how<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.660> sounds

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.340 

pretty<00:03:17.000> good<00:03:17.240> hey<00:03:17.390> from<00:03:17.630> those<00:03:17.810> triple

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
pretty good hey from those triple

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.410 
pretty good hey from those triple
exhaust<00:03:18.710> tips<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> center<00:03:19.670> there<00:03:19.850> and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
exhaust tips in the center there and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.700 
exhaust tips in the center there and
also<00:03:20.570> you've<00:03:20.780> got<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.020> little<00:03:21.170> bent<00:03:21.500> here

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
also you've got this little bent here

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.650 
also you've got this little bent here
which<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:21.950> find<00:03:22.160> interesting<00:03:22.280> because<00:03:22.850> it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
which I find interesting because it

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.120 
which I find interesting because it
pulls<00:03:23.930> air<00:03:24.230> straight<00:03:24.620> from<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> exhaust

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
pulls air straight from the exhaust

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820 
pulls air straight from the exhaust

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
boxes in the in the center sort of under

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.710 
boxes in the in the center sort of under
here<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.310> will<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:29.030> pulls<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.360> straight

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
here if you will and pulls it straight

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.570 
here if you will and pulls it straight
out<00:03:29.930> everything<00:03:30.860> about<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.160> car<00:03:31.370> is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
aerodynamics all over the shop just look

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.680 
aerodynamics all over the shop just look
at<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:33.950> line<00:03:34.250> through<00:03:35.000> them<00:03:35.150> through<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
at this line through them through the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.600 
at this line through them through the
mirror<00:03:35.900> here<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.070> just<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:37.550> the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
mirror here you can just see how the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.730 
mirror here you can just see how the
hair<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.000> pulled<00:03:38.450> through<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.290> sucked<00:03:39.590> in

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
hair is pulled through and sucked in

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.540 
hair is pulled through and sucked in
there<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:41.150> rear<00:03:41.330> wing<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.990> comes<00:03:42.230> up<00:03:42.550> goes

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
there the rear wing that comes up goes

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.760 
there the rear wing that comes up goes
up<00:03:43.580> at<00:03:43.820> about<00:03:44.000> 50<00:03:44.390> miles<00:03:44.540> an<00:03:44.690> hour<00:03:44.780> down<00:03:45.050> at<00:03:45.260> 25

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
up at about 50 miles an hour down at 25

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.790 
up at about 50 miles an hour down at 25
or<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.630> comes<00:03:47.630> up<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:48.110> sort<00:03:48.320> of<00:03:48.380> quite<00:03:48.590> high

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
or so comes up to sort of quite high

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.980 
or so comes up to sort of quite high
it's<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.250> double<00:03:49.610> layer<00:03:49.790> double<00:03:50.420> layered<00:03:50.720> wing

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
it's a double layer double layered wing

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's a double layer double layered wing
because<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.709> also<00:03:51.860> pulls<00:03:52.190> up<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.430> lower<00:03:52.610> layer

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
because it also pulls up a lower layer

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.270 
because it also pulls up a lower layer
back<00:03:53.120> up<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.510> height<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:54.010> got<00:03:55.010> these<00:03:55.100> nice

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
back up to that height I got these nice

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.699 
back up to that height I got these nice
little<00:03:55.570> wing<00:03:56.570> that's<00:03:56.780> for<00:03:57.080> airflow<00:03:57.380> off<00:03:57.560> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
little wing that's for airflow off the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.610 
little wing that's for airflow off the
back<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.600> those<00:03:59.600> wraparound<00:03:59.989> rear<00:04:00.350> lights

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
back and those wraparound rear lights

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.960 
back and those wraparound rear lights
are<00:04:00.800> really<00:04:01.010> quite<00:04:01.340> cool<00:04:01.550> too<00:04:03.880> given<00:04:04.880> that

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
are really quite cool too given that

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.920 
are really quite cool too given that
this<00:04:05.090> cars<00:04:05.330> done<00:04:06.040> 43,000<00:04:07.040> miles<00:04:07.480> I'd<00:04:08.480> say<00:04:08.780> it's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
this cars done 43,000 miles I'd say it's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.240 
this cars done 43,000 miles I'd say it's
doing<00:04:09.170> pretty<00:04:09.200> well<00:04:09.470> for<00:04:09.830> itself<00:04:13.360> Wow

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
doing pretty well for itself Wow

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.340 
doing pretty well for itself Wow
so<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.519> barely<00:04:16.730> have<00:04:17.000> any<00:04:17.239> LFA's<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.019> UK

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
so we barely have any LFA's in the UK

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.170 
so we barely have any LFA's in the UK
I've<00:04:18.739> been<00:04:18.919> trying<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.459> while<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.970> get<00:04:20.060> an

I've been trying for a while to get an

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.330 
I've been trying for a while to get an
opportunity<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.720> get<00:04:20.780> up<00:04:20.840> close<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.260> one<00:04:21.380> so

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
opportunity to get up close to one so

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
opportunity to get up close to one so
I'm<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.790> really<00:04:23.030> pleased<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.660> be<00:04:23.720> finally

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
I'm really really pleased to be finally

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.500
