 I mean this pillow obviously 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.930
 when you have a pillow after 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.570

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.700
 sleep and this 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.300
 but this is better to sleep this is 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.579
 the correct 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 we can is so good in this 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.440
 video of the manager and him

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.550
 because of auto that is the one indicated for 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.439
 that's where the defect does not matter 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 where does that franklin drug addict live 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.689

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.900
 I was in these directions but remember 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.550

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.290
 understand why the plants are so 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.390
 difficult to investigate 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.950
 and it's really hard to maintain a 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.030
 dialect with them because when 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.640
 you start talking and ask them to tell you 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.820
 pass the knowledge they put crazy 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.630
