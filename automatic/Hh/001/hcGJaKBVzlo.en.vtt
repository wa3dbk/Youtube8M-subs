00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.110 
course i have a white gal accessory so I
just<00:00:32.439> decided<00:00:32.590> why<00:00:33.070> not<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.460> go<00:00:33.610> for<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.820> black

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
just decided why not just go for a black

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.510 
just decided why not just go for a black
case<00:00:34.719> instead<00:00:35.079> of<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.379> white<00:00:35.680> one<00:00:35.890> just<00:00:36.370> want

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
case instead of the white one just want

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.860 
case instead of the white one just want
to<00:00:36.610> try<00:00:36.760> something<00:00:37.000> kind<00:00:37.719> of<00:00:37.810> different

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
to try something kind of different

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.890 
to try something kind of different
anyways<00:00:38.860> so<00:00:39.400> first<00:00:40.000> off<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.420> probably<00:00:40.540> want

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
anyways so first off you probably want

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.360 
anyways so first off you probably want
to<00:00:40.960> know<00:00:41.050> how<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.320> gal<00:00:41.530> accessory<00:00:41.980> fits<00:00:42.220> in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
to know how the gal accessory fits in

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.979 
to know how the gal accessory fits in
here<00:00:42.400> so<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.060> you<00:00:43.300> probably<00:00:43.540> want<00:00:43.810> to<00:00:43.870> know

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
here so and you probably want to know

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.500 
here so and you probably want to know
why<00:00:44.200> this<00:00:44.310> little<00:00:45.310> fob<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:45.730> going<00:00:46.149> like<00:00:46.300> this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
why this little fob is going like this

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.750 
why this little fob is going like this
is<00:00:46.720> just<00:00:46.750> kind<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.290> loose<00:00:47.530> but<00:00:48.070> hopefully<00:00:48.610> this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
is just kind of loose but hopefully this

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.549 
is just kind of loose but hopefully this
all<00:00:49.000> answers<00:00:49.420> your<00:00:49.570> questions<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.320> let<00:00:50.440> me<00:00:50.530> put

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
all answers your questions so let me put

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.310 
all answers your questions so let me put
the<00:00:50.860> galaxy<00:00:51.160> s3<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:52.720> you<00:00:52.750> see<00:00:53.079> that

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
the galaxy s3 in and as you see that

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.650 
the galaxy s3 in and as you see that
flab<00:00:53.590> just<00:00:54.010> went<00:00:54.250> or<00:00:54.640> this<00:00:54.820> little<00:00:55.000> tab<00:00:55.390> I

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
flab just went or this little tab I

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.040 
flab just went or this little tab I
should<00:00:55.870> say<00:00:56.079> just<00:00:56.620> went<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.130> its<00:00:58.000> it<00:00:58.360> has<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.840> bit

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
should say just went in its it has a bit

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.080 
should say just went in its it has a bit
of<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.230> magnet<00:00:59.710> here<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.160> here<00:01:00.399> which<00:01:00.610> keeps<00:01:00.940> it

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
of a magnet here and here which keeps it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.880 
of a magnet here and here which keeps it
in<00:01:01.180> place<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:01.660> if<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.200> move<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.530> bit<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.800> the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
in place so if you move it a bit to the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.380 
in place so if you move it a bit to the
side<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.219> definitely<00:01:03.579> automatically<00:01:04.180> comes

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
side it definitely automatically comes

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.969 
side it definitely automatically comes
back<00:01:04.629> so<00:01:05.110> that's<00:01:05.290> definitely<00:01:05.530> an<00:01:05.770> advantage

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
back so that's definitely an advantage

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.100 
back so that's definitely an advantage
it<00:01:06.310> keeps<00:01:06.549> that<00:01:06.759> tab<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.360> placing<00:01:07.810> because<00:01:07.990> you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
it keeps that tab in placing because you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.809 
it keeps that tab in placing because you
don't<00:01:08.320> want<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.829> don't<00:01:09.310> want<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.640> going

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:09.819 
don't want it you don't want it going

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.179 
don't want it you don't want it going
whoops<00:01:10.509> so<00:01:10.990> even<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.499> magnets<00:01:11.859> on<00:01:11.979> even

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
whoops so even the magnets on even

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.230 
whoops so even the magnets on even
letting<00:01:12.310> but<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.639> don't<00:01:12.789> want<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:12.999> flying

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
letting but you don't want it flying

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120 
letting but you don't want it flying
along<00:01:13.539> along<00:01:13.899> like<00:01:14.139> that<00:01:14.289> you<00:01:14.469> want<00:01:14.709> in<00:01:14.889> a<00:01:14.950> good

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
along along like that you want in a good

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.219 
along along like that you want in a good
position<00:01:15.310> when<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.240> are<00:01:16.420> holding<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.869> vegan

out<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.729> genuine<00:01:28.240> leather<00:01:28.719> so<00:01:29.109> maybe<00:01:29.889> you'll

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
out of genuine leather so maybe you'll

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.469 
out of genuine leather so maybe you'll
be<00:01:30.219> able<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.459> see<00:01:30.700> but<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.029> course<00:01:31.240> it's

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
be able to see but of course it's

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.599 
be able to see but of course it's
difficult<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.170> see<00:01:32.560> genuine<00:01:33.159> leather<00:01:33.189> but

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
difficult to see genuine leather but

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.760 
difficult to see genuine leather but
this<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.389> definitely<00:01:34.810> made<00:01:35.229> out<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.469> genuine

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
this is definitely made out of genuine

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.260 
this is definitely made out of genuine

make a very very slim pouch and the only

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.030 
make a very very slim pouch and the only
way<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.880> do<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.300> without<00:02:46.450> really<00:02:47.290> damaging<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
way to do it without really damaging it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.830 
way to do it without really damaging it
will<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.730> implement<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.299> kind<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.690> kind

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
