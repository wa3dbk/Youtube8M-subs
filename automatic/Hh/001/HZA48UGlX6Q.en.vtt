00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
the big muff big muff is available now

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.340 
the big muff big muff is available now
it's<00:01:55.329> been<00:01:55.450> available<00:01:55.659> for<00:01:55.810> quite<00:01:56.109> some<00:01:56.319> time

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it's been available for quite some time

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's been available for quite some time
maybe<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.340> maybe<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.750> been<00:01:58.869> available

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
maybe like maybe it's been available

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.140 
maybe like maybe it's been available
I<00:01:59.710> think<00:02:00.010> what's<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.760> difference<00:02:01.090> between

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
I think what's the difference between

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.270 
I think what's the difference between
it's<00:02:01.840> got<00:02:02.020> its<00:02:02.380> got<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.830> germanium

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
it's got its got for germanium

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
it's got its got for germanium
transistors<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.210> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.260 

gives<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:30.040> over<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> top<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:31.060> store

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
gives you like over the top to store

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.850 
gives you like over the top to store
showcase<00:02:31.660> oh<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> get<00:02:31.990> three<00:02:32.230> distortions<00:02:32.770> in

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
showcase oh you get three distortions in

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.940 
showcase oh you get three distortions in
one<00:02:33.010> box<00:02:33.190> really<00:02:33.820> okay<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:35.740> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
one box really okay and that's the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.150 
one box really okay and that's the
germanium<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.030> big<00:02:37.450> month<00:02:37.710> it's<00:02:38.710> got<00:02:38.890> for

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
germanium for big month it's got for

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.150 
germanium for big month it's got for
germanium<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.940> Katie<00:02:40.470> 275<00:02:41.470> transistors

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
germanium and Katie 275 transistors

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.970 
germanium and Katie 275 transistors
again<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> lil<00:02:43.930> mistress<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
again we have a lil mistress to the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:56.020 
again we have a lil mistress to the
planter

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.060 

it's<00:02:57.030> got<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.300> two<00:02:57.480> color<00:02:57.750> LED<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.980> can

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
it's got the two color LED so you can

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:33.399 
it's got the two color LED so you can
see<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> pulse

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.289 

you<00:03:34.409> can<00:03:34.560> also<00:03:34.650> has<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> built-in<00:03:35.579> effects<00:03:36.150> loop

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you can also has a built-in effects loop

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.099 
you can also has a built-in effects loop
in<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.989> run<00:03:37.200> petals<00:03:38.599> on<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
in it so you can run petals on to the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.970 
in it so you can run petals on to the
delay<00:03:40.439> so<00:03:40.769> as<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.069> trails<00:03:41.340> off<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.980> so

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
delay so as it trails off like this so

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.490 
delay so as it trails off like this so
each<00:03:44.250> delay<00:03:44.700> could<00:03:45.030> be<00:03:45.060> could<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.989> flanger

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
each delay could be could have a flanger

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.619 
each delay could be could have a flanger
have<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> distortion<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.849> kind<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.180> chorus

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
have a distortion on it kind of a chorus

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.170 
have a distortion on it kind of a chorus
pistol<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.200> east<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.099> lake<00:03:50.250> pattern<00:03:50.760> really

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
pistol a east of lake pattern really

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.089 
pistol a east of lake pattern really
because<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.840> effects<00:03:52.140> loop<00:03:52.319> because<00:03:52.769> as

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
because of the effects loop because as

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.309 
because of the effects loop because as
it<00:03:53.129> as<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.730> sails<00:03:54.060> off<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.810> goes<00:03:54.840> through<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
it as it sails off it goes through the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.040 
it as it sails off it goes through the
puddles<00:03:55.650> okay

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.340 

a<00:04:01.140> bunch<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.620> spaghetti<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:03.120> saw<00:04:03.750> what<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
a bunch of spaghetti here I saw what the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:54.260 
a bunch of spaghetti here I saw what the
talking<00:04:04.740> machine<00:04:04.830> that<00:04:05.490> coffee<00:04:05.700> machine<00:04:06.120> is

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270
