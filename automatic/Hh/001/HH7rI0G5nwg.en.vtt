00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
really huge but what I tend to do

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
really huge but what I tend to do
whenever<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.369> using<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.759> device<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.329> just

like this and I hold the device like

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.679 
like this and I hold the device like
that<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.799> way<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.130> oops<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.579> dropped<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that that way if I oops I dropped it you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.119 
that that way if I oops I dropped it you
know<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.930> course<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> bed<00:02:07.860> here

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
but if I were to hold it a little higher

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
but if I were to hold it a little higher
then<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.190> protecting<00:02:12.090> the

dropped out of that you know I've got a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.920 
dropped out of that you know I've got a
bunch<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.130> cases<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.970> by<00:02:32.270> far<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.570> one<00:02:32.810> of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
bunch of cases and this by far is one of

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.090 
bunch of cases and this by far is one of
the<00:02:32.990> best<00:02:33.140> because<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.440> stays<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.680> your<00:02:33.830> phone

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
the best because it stays on your phone

the best because it stays on your phone
you<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.730> use<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.480> keyboard<00:02:35.840> still<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.530> can

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can use the keyboard still you can

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.010 
you can use the keyboard still you can
move<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.310> screen<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.360> tilt<00:02:38.750> is

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
move the screen up now the tilt is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.170 
move the screen up now the tilt is
restricted<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.950> little<00:02:40.160> bit<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.400> this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
restricted a little bit because this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.000 
restricted a little bit because this
case<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.310> thicker<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.330> do

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
case here is a little thicker so you do

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.110 
case here is a little thicker so you do
lose<00:02:46.010> some<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.280> total<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:46.820> put<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.060> all

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
lose some of that total to be put it all

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.910 
lose some of that total to be put it all
the<00:02:47.240> way<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.990> notice<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.410> case<00:02:48.560> starts<00:02:48.830> to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the way you notice the case starts to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.030 
the way you notice the case starts to
bulge<00:02:49.100> up<00:02:49.310> there<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.440> don't<00:02:51.590> want<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:51.800> do

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
bulge up there so you don't want to do

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.010 
bulge up there so you don't want to do
that<00:02:52.070> but<00:02:52.640> other<00:02:53.120> than<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.540> works<00:02:53.840> really

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
that but other than that it works really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.230 
that but other than that it works really
well<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.350> love<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> lot<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.880> think

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
well I love it a lot and I think

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.180 
well I love it a lot and I think
everyone<00:02:56.900> who<00:02:57.350> has<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.500> touch<00:02:57.740> pro<00:02:57.920> two<00:02:58.130> still

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
everyone who has a touch pro two still

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.450 
everyone who has a touch pro two still
she'd<00:02:59.060> get<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.360> case<00:02:59.540> also<00:03:00.070> cut<00:03:01.070> out<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
she'd get this case also cut out for the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.770 
she'd get this case also cut out for the
stylus<00:03:02.680> one<00:03:03.680> last<00:03:03.950> comment<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.420> that

crap<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.510> my<00:03:17.690> screen<00:03:17.989> actually<00:03:18.320> spacing

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
crap like my screen actually spacing

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.729 
crap like my screen actually spacing
here<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.640> lot<00:03:19.880> wider<00:03:20.180> than<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.600> looks<00:03:20.989> but

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
here is a lot wider than it looks but

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.770 
here is a lot wider than it looks but
with<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:21.950> case<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.459> kind<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.880> masks<00:03:23.360> at<00:03:23.540> and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
with this case it kind of masks at and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.440 
with this case it kind of masks at and
it<00:03:23.840> makes<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.140> look<00:03:24.200> like<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> new<00:03:24.590> phone<00:03:24.830> so

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
