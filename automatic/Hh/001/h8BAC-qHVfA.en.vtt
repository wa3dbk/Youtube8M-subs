close<00:02:32.440> back<00:02:32.709> up<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:37.440> here's<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.500> roof<00:02:38.800> i<00:02:38.980> put

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
close back up and here's the roof i put

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.280 
close back up and here's the roof i put
in<00:02:39.280> here<00:02:39.430> too<00:02:39.670> those<00:02:40.390> are<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.570> bottoms<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
in here too those are the bottoms of the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.080 
in here too those are the bottoms of the
enchantment<00:02:41.590> tables<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.520> thought<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.910> had<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
enchantment tables I thought I had a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.560 
enchantment tables I thought I had a
nice<00:02:43.330> design<00:02:44.310> also<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.640> lights<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.060> there<00:02:46.209> too

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.350 

let's<00:02:49.570> see<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.760> something<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.180> did

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
let's see this is just something I did

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.800 
let's see this is just something I did
for<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:54.720> storage<00:02:55.720> for<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.320> farm

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
for the storage for the farm

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
for the storage for the farm
and<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.959> haven't<00:03:01.959> done<00:03:02.110> much<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.470> this<00:03:02.620> over

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
and I haven't done much with this over

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.729 
and I haven't done much with this over
here<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:04.510> doesn't<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:05.020> anything<00:03:05.500> i<00:03:05.709> just

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
here that doesn't do anything i just

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.780 
here that doesn't do anything i just
kind<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.160> experiment<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.180> us<00:03:07.270> trying<00:03:07.599> out

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
kind of experiment that us trying out

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.229 
kind of experiment that us trying out
that<00:03:09.790> don't<00:03:10.060> work<00:03:10.209> out<00:03:10.360> too<00:03:10.420> well<00:03:10.630> though<00:03:10.989> so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
that don't work out too well though so

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.100 
that don't work out too well though so
here's<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.390> flooring<00:03:13.780> idea<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.800> i<00:03:14.830> had<00:03:15.130> i

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
here's the flooring idea that i had i

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.220 
here's the flooring idea that i had i
send<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.170> kids<00:03:17.349> already<00:03:17.680> put<00:03:18.239> brick<00:03:19.239> down<00:03:19.450> so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
send the kids already put brick down so

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.130 
send the kids already put brick down so
i<00:03:20.500> just<00:03:20.739> added<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.160> those<00:03:21.430> pine<00:03:22.330> wood<00:03:22.569> logs<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
i just added in those pine wood logs a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.830 
i just added in those pine wood logs a
little<00:03:23.709> bit<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.099> design<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:26.280> an<00:03:27.280> episode

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
little bit of a design to it an episode

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.479 
little bit of a design to it an episode
240<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.230> believe<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.650> was<00:03:29.800> he<00:03:30.040> was<00:03:30.130> talking

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
240 and believe it was he was talking

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.160 
240 and believe it was he was talking
about<00:03:30.550> redoing<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.360> whole<00:03:31.540> area<00:03:31.900> back<00:03:32.140> here

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
about redoing this whole area back here

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.009 
about redoing this whole area back here
and<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:33.069> what<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> came<00:03:33.430> up<00:03:33.610> with

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
and this is just what I came up with

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.750 
and this is just what I came up with
using<00:03:35.019> half<00:03:35.350> slabs<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> stairs<00:03:36.700> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
using half slabs for the stairs to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.020 
using half slabs for the stairs to
change<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.060> colors<00:03:40.600> on<00:03:40.780> each<00:03:40.810> step<00:03:42.030> keeping

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
change the colors on each step keeping

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.180 
change the colors on each step keeping
with<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.269> cobblestone<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.170> clay<00:03:44.920> brick

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
with the cobblestone and clay brick

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.360 
with the cobblestone and clay brick
theme

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.940 

and

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
and

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.640 
and
the<00:03:50.489> staircase<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.900> talked<00:03:52.110> about<00:03:52.230> changing

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
the staircase we talked about changing

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.040 
the staircase we talked about changing
this<00:03:52.770> around<00:03:53.099> for<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.400> while<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.150> was

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
this around for a while and I was

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.890 
this around for a while and I was
getting<00:03:55.680> too<00:03:55.860> close<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.430> gate<00:03:56.760> here<00:03:57.209> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
getting too close to this gate here and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.400 
getting too close to this gate here and
to<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.360> hallway<00:04:00.360> here<00:04:00.690> making<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.260> too

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
to this hallway here making it too

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.710 
to this hallway here making it too
crowded<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.580> turned<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.970> into<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.180> diagonal

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
crowded so turned it into a diagonal

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.680 
crowded so turned it into a diagonal
using<00:04:03.989> cobblestone<00:04:04.470> half<00:04:04.680> slabs<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:08.690> believe

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
using cobblestone half slabs I believe

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.550 
using cobblestone half slabs I believe
that<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.349> it<00:04:11.569> besides<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.750> staircase<00:04:13.319> over

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that is it besides the staircase over

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.969 
that is it besides the staircase over
here<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:14.480> same<00:04:15.480> thing<00:04:15.720> as<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.079> staircase<00:04:16.829> of

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
here this same thing as the staircase of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.530 
here this same thing as the staircase of
the<00:04:17.040> teleporters<00:04:17.669> use<00:04:17.850> some<00:04:18.030> half<00:04:18.209> slabs

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
the teleporters use some half slabs

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.040 
the teleporters use some half slabs
there<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:22.250> engines<00:04:23.250> an<00:04:23.400> exit<00:04:24.050> works

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
there and this engines an exit works

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.600 
there and this engines an exit works
both<00:04:25.290> ways<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.620> set<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.100> flip<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.460> switch

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
both ways you set the flip that switch

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.629 
both ways you set the flip that switch
to<00:04:26.760> get<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.270> out<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:30.750> switch<00:04:31.229> again<00:04:31.639> to

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
to get back out and you switch again to

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.200 
to get back out and you switch again to
close<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.910> back<00:04:33.060> open<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.479> up<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.669> yeah<00:04:36.030> guys

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
close the back open it up so yeah guys

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.490 
close the back open it up so yeah guys
that's<00:04:36.270> what<00:04:36.660> I've<00:04:36.780> done<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> Syndicates

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
that's what I've done the Syndicates

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.629 
that's what I've done the Syndicates
world<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:39.540> hope<00:04:40.470> he<00:04:40.770> finds<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.310> video
