00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 Nevertheless, they were important 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 because of them 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.179
 has sword 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
 ever seen such ideas 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.319
 Just raise your hand then year 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.030
 I thought so 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.480
 Stefan in urges 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 your child 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 one or the other 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 granted this morning tell of the shareholder in which the children 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.720
 of course, have not seen anything abroad this altitude anymore 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 reports to 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.190
 as a zombie 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.220
 those can block 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 and obviously that's the way it is 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.530
 then Rheine 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.120
 there was so far 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 what was in there 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.900
 under how long 22 children but Khan in the conversation only triggered 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.070
 this shell 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.450
 to the fore 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.730
 the strong contributions BAK in the children 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.630
 14 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.689
 with pliers enjoys with the took the start could 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 and all individual contributions compiled 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.280
 but in concrete terms of zombies 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 that the resurrected dead were 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.950
 living need to live 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.009
 and they knew even more that the trend and there must be something else 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.440
 the DIMDI Allan 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.020
 if they have eaten then to the fools will take as a zombie 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 continue 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.630
 the Basque Country 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.950
 yes enthusiastically inform Matthias Essmann 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.999
 this movie bet on us 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.349
 I can only say how I feel and and 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.870
 what has triggered in me sweaty hands South Africa 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.369
 Back written down throb 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.179
 and the heart is knocking 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.649
 So I always thank you alternately 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.489
 So please, please, I'm not also Trichet 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.399
 slow usually can not sleep 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.939
 So it's impossible 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.679
 No 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:37.310
 in mathematical terms every trace is basically the leaf 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.259
 that had nothing to do with the club 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.019
 and I have to say that I can believe it after the slippers 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.559
 to compare with her 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.559
 JL 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.239
 I think if I would like such cases then I would 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.529
 I think I'm really sick of Nils without me when I get to it 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:52.939
 this 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.629
 he thought 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.629
 because of ours for me a bit like I could not do that 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.169
 then they start, but I also found the style of the 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.219
 Film simply bad Visser for the reason 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.899
 for my terms Wanders lined up in this house ten 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.700
 and no sense of action is taken 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.199
 no tension 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.749
 have always asked us when that comes finally no tension 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.820
 For me, the real no was clear that the movie was just out 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.340
 look like this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.979
 all together to rows 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.180
 I'm so pretty about so repugnant 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.019
 "People were shown in relationships 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.869
 and there was no relationship yet 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.979
 there was no friendship either suddenly and no man liked 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.099
 knew why completely pointless something so pointless a pure crime something 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.059
 to concoct without mind without understanding 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:51.169
 only destruction is just terrible is just terrible 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.200
 Of course, I would feel so sorry for myself and I still have it 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.729
 not to my brother » 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.059
 even though I ex-factory that's important because so come on it allows loud 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.779
 but i just could not judge it 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.649
 TVs and disgusting and want 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:10.359
 the thriller deep down to the go-not-more and percent I thought him too yes 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.399
 and when children see what happens to the country 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.769
 and I do not understand why so whatsoever turned around at all 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.849
 Answer I do it but it has to be yes 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.310
 Well, many people have seen so what all the older speed dating 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.309
 all were then able 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.509
 in plain language that means 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.509
 the demonization of the video medium to digital solutions 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.740
 alone is not enough 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.029
 Children and adolescents need to be critical of the television 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.029
 Recorder and camera are pulled 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.629
 That's easier said than done 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.849
 in school and leisure Heinen not only lack the technical equipment 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.449
 There is also a lack of knowledgeable staff 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.860
 One of the very few examples of successful media education is the 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.919
 Youth film club can show a charitable association of the common 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.629
 is borne by the city of Feldkirchen and various cultural institutions 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.789
 Here teenagers from the district Dellbrück do not make a video 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.789
 Documentation about perceived violence 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.139
 Jörg interviews Alexa and her brother Philipp 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.539
 who reacted quite differently to their first song the film 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.850
 and he interviews a 28-year-old dental assistant who turns out to be a zombie 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.789
 Strands confesses 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.319
 After the filming, the team meets and chooses 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.479
 Processing the extensive material to prevent so many afternoons 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.759
 the students still have to spend in the editing room 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.179
 every post for the video magazine only when it's done 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.129
 That's why the program is already being demonstrated everywhere 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.169
 where young people meet 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.210
 in kindergarten 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.610
 in youth centers 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.400
 in schools 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.819
 and sometimes on the monitor wall 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819
 in a shopping arcade 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.369
 not the right place by 1 2 percent 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.939
 why should not we have too much together 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.270
 very excited 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.320
 I would not be able to sit down at the beginning 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.749
 completely autonomously comical feeling when I then at home reported the newspaper 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.139
 the star chef 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.789
 In the evening, but rather everything should be on then very bad day 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.909
 I always gave myself 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.719
 in points 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.529
 the novel 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.110
