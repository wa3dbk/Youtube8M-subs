00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
so I've owned the car since 2007 and I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.780 
so I've owned the car since 2007 and I
bought<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.690> then<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.229> replace<00:01:21.590> my<00:01:22.130> first<00:01:22.400> 240

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790

which<00:01:22.940> I<00:01:23.060> bought<00:01:23.210> in<00:01:23.270> 2003<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.549> think<00:01:25.549> my<00:01:25.880> car<00:01:26.150> is

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
which I bought in 2003 I think my car is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.450 
which I bought in 2003 I think my car is
kind<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:26.960> unique<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.799> few<00:01:27.979> 40<00:01:28.250> seen

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
kind of unique in the few 40 seen

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.450 
kind of unique in the few 40 seen
because<00:01:28.969> it's<00:01:29.149> not<00:01:29.360> here<00:01:29.600> typical<00:01:30.460> drift

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
because it's not here typical drift

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.749 
because it's not here typical drift
missile<00:01:31.820> it's<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.659> pretty<00:01:33.530> low<00:01:33.740> key<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.250> have<00:01:34.729> a

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
missile it's a pretty low key but have a

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.270 
missile it's a pretty low key but have a
decent<00:01:35.479> amount<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.719> horsepower<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.189> know

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
decent amount of horsepower and you know

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.399 
decent amount of horsepower and you know
it's<00:01:37.549> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.119> set<00:01:38.299> up<00:01:38.329> for<00:01:38.630> once

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.840 

so<00:01:42.409> as<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.649> can<00:01:42.770> see<00:01:42.829> on<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.310> outside<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.789> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
so as you can see on the outside of the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.380 
so as you can see on the outside of the
car<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:45.280> not<00:01:46.280> much<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.670> really<00:01:47.119> done<00:01:47.270> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
car it's a not much is really done to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.340 
car it's a not much is really done to
the<00:01:47.479> outside<00:01:47.509> but<00:01:49.090> my<00:01:50.090> primary<00:01:50.390> focus<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the outside but my primary focus of the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.770 
the outside but my primary focus of the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.830 
when I first started racing drag racing
I<00:02:31.160> had<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:31.730> stock<00:02:32.030> SR<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.630> stock

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
I had just the stock SR with a stock

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.809 
I had just the stock SR with a stock
turbo<00:02:33.170> on<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.890> was<00:02:33.980> only<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> low<00:02:34.459> 13

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
turbo on it so it was only like a low 13

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.600 
turbo on it so it was only like a low 13
second<00:02:35.120> car<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:36.560> older<00:02:36.829> gentleman<00:02:37.280> came

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.710 
second car and an older gentleman came
in<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> Dodge<00:02:38.209> Viper

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
in with a Dodge Viper

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.199 
in with a Dodge Viper
with<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> only<00:02:39.769> street<00:02:40.040> tires<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:40.849> I

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
all the tacking and he did so and we

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.759 
all the tacking and he did so and we
lined<00:03:01.730> up<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.150> he<00:03:02.900> basically<00:03:03.200> couldn't<00:03:03.620> get

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
lined up and he basically couldn't get

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.150 
lined up and he basically couldn't get
traction<00:03:04.010> whatsoever<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.359> I<00:03:05.810> did<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.470> so

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
traction whatsoever and and I did and so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.590 
traction whatsoever and and I did and so
I<00:03:07.190> killed<00:03:07.489> him<00:03:07.609> out<00:03:07.639> of<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> hole<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.209> he

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
I killed him out of the hole and he

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.770 
I killed him out of the hole and he
basically<00:03:08.930> ran<00:03:09.139> in<00:03:09.319> mid<00:03:09.470> 13<00:03:10.420> due<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.569> lack<00:03:11.750> of

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
basically ran in mid 13 due to lack of

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.289 
basically ran in mid 13 due to lack of
traction<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> actually<00:03:13.160> do<00:03:13.430> pretty

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
traction and so I actually do pretty

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.020 
traction and so I actually do pretty
funny<00:03:14.920> future<00:03:15.920> plans<00:03:16.190> are<00:03:16.459> I'm<00:03:16.850> actually

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
funny future plans are I'm actually

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.030 
funny future plans are I'm actually
going<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.569> swapping<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.410> chassis<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.010> a
