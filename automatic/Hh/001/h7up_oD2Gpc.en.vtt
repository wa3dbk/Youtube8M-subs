I got two raised beds on this side right
here<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.250> gonna<00:00:17.370> be<00:00:18.080> pickling<00:00:19.080> cucumbers

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
here this is gonna be pickling cucumbers

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.710 
here this is gonna be pickling cucumbers
and<00:00:20.280> on<00:00:20.610> this<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:21.030> this<00:00:21.269> is<00:00:21.420> gonna<00:00:21.539> be

and on this side this is gonna be
slicing<00:00:22.529> cucumbers

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
slicing cucumbers

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.890 
slicing cucumbers
but<00:00:24.949> anyway<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.580> same<00:00:25.760> setup<00:00:26.210> as<00:00:26.390> last<00:00:26.660> year

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
but anyway the same setup as last year

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.269 
but anyway the same setup as last year
except<00:00:27.260> you<00:00:27.380> know<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.560> got<00:00:27.740> a<00:00:27.770> whole<00:00:28.100> lot<00:00:28.250> more

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
except you know I got a whole lot more

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.960 
except you know I got a whole lot more
longer<00:00:28.730> rows<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.980> plants<00:00:31.490> can<00:00:31.580> be<00:00:31.640> spaced

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
longer rows and the plants can be spaced

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.760 
longer rows and the plants can be spaced
a<00:00:32.150> foot<00:00:32.360> half<00:00:32.629> part<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:33.200> know<00:00:33.320> foot<00:00:33.530> six

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
a foot half part you know foot six

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.240 
a foot half part you know foot six
inches<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:35.650> I'm<00:00:36.650> gonna<00:00:36.770> go<00:00:36.890> ahead<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.129> get

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
inches and so I'm gonna go ahead and get

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.990 
inches and so I'm gonna go ahead and get
marking<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.870> know<00:00:38.930> I'm<00:00:39.020> just<00:00:39.110> gonna<00:00:39.320> kinda

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
marking you know I'm just gonna kinda

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.330 
marking you know I'm just gonna kinda
guess<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:42.559> rows<00:00:42.739> going<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.070> be<00:00:43.129> about<00:00:43.280> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
guess it the rows going to be about a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.390 
guess it the rows going to be about a
foot<00:00:43.640> apart<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.739> little<00:00:45.949> more<00:00:46.100> than<00:00:46.250> that

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
foot apart and a little more than that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.790 
foot apart and a little more than that
and<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.660> plants<00:00:47.930> gonna<00:00:48.140> be<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.290> foot<00:00:48.530> six

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and then the plants gonna be a foot six

00:00:48.800 --> 00:01:00.420 
and then the plants gonna be a foot six
inches

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.880 

so<00:01:01.060> again<00:01:01.450> I<00:01:01.690> did<00:01:01.870> more<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.200> triangle

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
so again I did more of the triangle

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.940 
so again I did more of the triangle
method<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.520> planting<00:01:04.180> things<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:05.710> my

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
method of planting things because my

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.220 
method of planting things because my
rows<00:01:06.190> here<00:01:06.550> are<00:01:07.390> kind<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.720> close<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.140> each

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
rows here are kind of close to each

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.020 
rows here are kind of close to each
other<00:01:08.380> they're<00:01:08.680> only<00:01:08.800> like<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.070> foot<00:01:09.400> apart<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
other they're only like a foot apart and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.400 
other they're only like a foot apart and
the<00:01:13.030> plants<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.480> need<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.840> foot<00:01:14.140> six

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
the plants that need to be a foot six

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.550 
the plants that need to be a foot six
inches<00:01:14.710> apart<00:01:14.830> from<00:01:15.130> each<00:01:15.250> other<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:16.380> each<00:01:17.380> of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
inches apart from each other so each of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
inches apart from each other so each of
this<00:01:17.650> hole<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.040> that's<00:01:18.190> where<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> plant

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
this hole is that's where a plant

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.210 
this hole is that's where a plant
supposed<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:20.200> if<00:01:20.410> you<00:01:20.830> measure<00:01:21.070> it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
supposed to be but if you measure it

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.640 
supposed to be but if you measure it
it's<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.790> foot<00:01:22.000> six<00:01:22.300> inches<00:01:22.600> apart<00:01:22.930> between

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
it's a foot six inches apart between

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.480 
it's a foot six inches apart between
each<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.130> every<00:01:24.400> single<00:01:24.730> plant<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:27.310> is

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
each and every single plant and this is

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.630 
each and every single plant and this is
just<00:01:27.640> something<00:01:27.820> I'm<00:01:27.970> trying<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.480> year<00:01:29.640> but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
just something I'm trying this year but

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.020 
just something I'm trying this year but
it<00:01:30.730> works<00:01:30.940> perfectly<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.750> theory<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.030> they're

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
it works perfectly in theory and they're

00:01:34.030 --> 00:02:22.900 
it works perfectly in theory and they're
all<00:01:34.150> spaced<00:01:34.479> out<00:01:34.660> on<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.840> foot<00:01:35.050> six<00:01:35.350> inches

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.980 

here<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.330> done<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.900> you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
here it is all done and you know you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.310 
here it is all done and you know you
might<00:02:28.380> remember<00:02:28.880> what<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.910> said<00:02:30.030> earlier<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.930> had

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
might remember what I said earlier I had

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.570 
might remember what I said earlier I had
some<00:02:32.570> pickling<00:02:33.570> cucumbers<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.800> plants

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
some pickling cucumbers you know plants

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.120 
some pickling cucumbers you know plants
that<00:02:35.670> look<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.330> over<00:02:36.600> here<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
that look like these over here and I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.130 
that look like these over here and I
said<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.610> gonna<00:02:38.730> plant<00:02:39.030> them<00:02:39.150> out<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.570> if

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
said I was gonna plant them out and if

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
said I was gonna plant them out and if
the<00:02:40.260> frost<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.710> whatever<00:02:40.980> gets<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the frost or whatever gets them so be it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
the frost or whatever gets them so be it
well<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.320> pay<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.890> doing<00:02:44.190> all

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
well this is what I pay for doing all

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.090 
well this is what I pay for doing all
this<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.570> these<00:02:45.870> are<00:02:46.050> all<00:02:46.170> new<00:02:46.410> young<00:02:46.680> plants

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
this so these are all new young plants

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.370 
this so these are all new young plants
I've<00:02:47.220> started<00:02:47.490> these<00:02:48.240> are<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.750> plants<00:02:49.170> y'all

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
I've started these are the plants y'all

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560 
I've started these are the plants y'all
familiar<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.460> are<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.820> slicing

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
familiar with these are the slicing

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.200 
familiar with these are the slicing
cucumbers<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.910> that's<00:02:56.910> how<00:02:57.060> they<00:02:57.180> are

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
cucumbers but that's how they are

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.570 
cucumbers but that's how they are
looking
