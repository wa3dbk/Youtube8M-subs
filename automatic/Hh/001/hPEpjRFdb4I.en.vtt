somebody actually hanging on the end of
this<00:02:08.750> rope<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.220> before<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.360> want<00:02:11.569> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
this rope so before I do that I want to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630 
this rope so before I do that I want to
check<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.930> system<00:02:12.319> all<00:02:12.950> locked<00:02:13.460> up

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
check my system all locked up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.750 
check my system all locked up
everything's<00:02:14.150> ready<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.550> pull

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
everything's ready so I'm going to pull

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.830 
everything's ready so I'm going to pull
down<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.270> system

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
down the system

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.699 
down the system
I'm<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.080> use<00:02:18.170> I'm<00:02:18.349> going<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.530> pull<00:02:18.680> down

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
I'm going to use I'm going to pull down

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.949 
I'm going to use I'm going to pull down
on<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> break<00:02:20.540> strand

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
on this that's actually the break strand

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.070 
on this that's actually the break strand
and<00:02:21.590> I'm<00:02:21.680> going<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.890> stand<00:02:22.129> in<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:23.080> should

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and I'm going to stand in this I should

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.660 
and I'm going to stand in this I should
make<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.290> pretty<00:02:24.500> easy<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.920> defeat<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:27.670> we're

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
make it pretty easy to defeat now we're

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.780 
make it pretty easy to defeat now we're
already<00:02:28.940> defeating<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.310> because<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.519> can

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
already defeating it because I can

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
already defeating it because I can
separate<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.360> rope<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.900> don't<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.950> fold

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
separate the rope I don't have to fold

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220 
separate the rope I don't have to fold
this<00:02:34.370> thing<00:02:34.430> all<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.910> way<00:02:34.940> back<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:35.629> only<00:02:35.840> have

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this thing all the way back I only have

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.900 
this thing all the way back I only have
to<00:02:36.379> defeat<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.830> enough<00:02:37.099> for<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.370> ropes<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
to defeat it enough for the ropes to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.600 
to defeat it enough for the ropes to
slide<00:02:38.180> by<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.010> already<00:02:40.160> starting

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
slide by so you see it already starting

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.530 
slide by so you see it already starting
to<00:02:40.640> move<00:02:41.530> gem<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.709> lowering<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:44.510> just

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
to move gem I'm lowering it I can just

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.420 
to move gem I'm lowering it I can just
start<00:02:44.840> letting<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.230> out<00:02:45.319> there<00:02:45.920> goes<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:46.280> rope

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
start letting it out there goes the rope

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 
start letting it out there goes the rope
sliding<00:02:47.000> through<00:02:47.150> all<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.140> got<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.620> open

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
sliding through all I got to do is open

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.720 
sliding through all I got to do is open
it<00:02:48.950> up<00:02:49.069> enough

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
it up enough

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.990 
it up enough
the<00:02:50.239> ropes<00:02:51.049> don't<00:02:51.290> touch<00:02:51.560> I've<00:02:52.430> got<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.819> backed

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
the ropes don't touch I've got it backed

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.360 
the ropes don't touch I've got it backed
up<00:02:53.180> with<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.390> auto<00:02:53.599> block<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> can

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
up with the auto block here so I can

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.930 
up with the auto block here so I can
just<00:02:55.549> control<00:02:55.849> this<00:02:56.150> really<00:02:56.660> nice<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:58.760> easy

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
just control this really nice it's easy

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.479 
just control this really nice it's easy
to<00:02:59.150> stand<00:02:59.329> in<00:02:59.630> once<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:00.860> open<00:03:01.310> it's

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
to stand in once I have it open it's

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.880 
to stand in once I have it open it's
pretty<00:03:01.790> easy<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.180> keep<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.510> open<00:03:03.700> all<00:03:04.700> right

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
pretty easy to keep it open all right

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.100 
pretty easy to keep it open all right
when<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> get<00:03:07.010> Jim<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.610> ground<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.930> good

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
when I get Jim to the ground it's good

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.300 
when I get Jim to the ground it's good
pretty<00:03:12.290> easy<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.739> reverse<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.220> system<00:03:18.310> we

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
pretty easy to reverse the system we

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.979 
pretty easy to reverse the system we
just<00:03:19.579> let<00:03:19.760> out<00:03:19.910> as<00:03:20.060> much<00:03:20.269> rope<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.660> we<00:03:20.780> need

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
just let out as much rope as we need

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.140 
just let out as much rope as we need
there's<00:03:21.410> no<00:03:21.560> big<00:03:21.799> deal<00:03:22.010> however<00:03:22.549> much<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:23.000> need

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
there's no big deal however much we need

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.270 
there's no big deal however much we need
all<00:03:23.780> right<00:03:23.900> obviously<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.829> on<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.069> ground

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
all right obviously is on the ground

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.490 
all right obviously is on the ground
we're<00:03:25.489> all<00:03:25.579> loose<00:03:25.819> take<00:03:26.690> my<00:03:26.840> foot<00:03:27.079> out<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.230> that

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
we're all loose take my foot out of that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.629 
we're all loose take my foot out of that
I<00:03:29.109> can<00:03:30.109> simply<00:03:30.410> take<00:03:30.620> off<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.010> redirect<00:03:31.489> up

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
I can simply take off the redirect up

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.020 
I can simply take off the redirect up
here<00:03:31.880> we're<00:03:32.480> right<00:03:32.720> back<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:32.959> Auto<00:03:33.260> block<00:03:33.530> mode

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
here we're right back in Auto block mode

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.470 
here we're right back in Auto block mode
Jim<00:03:35.030> Ian<00:03:35.209> climb<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.970> can<00:03:38.090> start<00:03:38.299> climbing

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
Jim Ian climb you can start climbing

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.670 
Jim Ian climb you can start climbing
again<00:03:38.980> we're<00:03:39.980> right<00:03:40.160> back<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.370> Blaine

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
again we're right back to Blaine

again we're right back to Blaine
so<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.980> don't<00:03:43.459> even<00:03:43.549> necessarily<00:03:43.760> need<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.389> take

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so I don't even necessarily need to take

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.199 
so I don't even necessarily need to take
my<00:03:44.690> auto<00:03:44.810> block<00:03:45.049> off<00:03:45.230> right<00:03:45.470> away<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.790> since<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
my auto block off right away but since I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.509

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
I can just take and get it up tight and

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.280 
I can just take and get it up tight and
start<00:03:53.720> doing<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:55.239> that's<00:03:56.239> it<00:03:56.450> defeating<00:03:57.200> the
