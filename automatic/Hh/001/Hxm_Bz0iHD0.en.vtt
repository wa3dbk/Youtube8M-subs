works<00:05:19.229> so<00:05:19.470> far<00:05:19.740> now<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.340> good<00:05:20.699> thing<00:05:20.759> about

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
works so far now the good thing about

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.700 
works so far now the good thing about
this<00:05:21.449> is<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:23.539> since<00:05:24.539> it<00:05:24.720> really<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.229> from<00:05:25.470> one

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
this is that since it really is from one

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.129 
this is that since it really is from one
one<00:05:26.130> skein<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.550> yarn<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:27.599> colors<00:05:27.930> will

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
one skein of yarn the colors will

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.439 
one skein of yarn the colors will
coordinate<00:05:28.650> those<00:05:28.979> it<00:05:29.250> will<00:05:29.460> look<00:05:29.699> stripy<00:05:30.030> I

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
coordinate those it will look stripy I

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.570 
coordinate those it will look stripy I
don't<00:05:31.020> think<00:05:31.349> I'll<00:05:31.500> have<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.800> block<00:05:32.099> this<00:05:32.340> one

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
don't think I'll have to block this one

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.980 
don't think I'll have to block this one
as<00:05:32.789> much<00:05:33.300> because<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.349> Garter<00:05:34.800> stitch

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
as much because of the Garter stitch

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.680 
as much because of the Garter stitch
it'll<00:05:36.990> feel<00:05:37.199> a<00:05:37.229> little<00:05:37.500> heavier<00:05:37.860> but<00:05:38.610> so<00:05:39.389> I

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
it'll feel a little heavier but so I

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.750 
it'll feel a little heavier but so I
