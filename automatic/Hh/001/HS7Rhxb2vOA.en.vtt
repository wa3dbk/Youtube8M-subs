00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.970
 do an analysis of a video game for 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 it is very cool that is called web game 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.270
 this video game of the same 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.010
 developers is not for android 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 but yes in the google play you put tweet 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 that you will come out many variants 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
 of this exquisite video game that was one 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 of the best of last year of 2013 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.720
 very addictive trick how are you going to see now 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.610
 the truth that is really worth it 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.769
 try it do not worry it 's for it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 is this same application for android not 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.040
 but other developers have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
 cloned in some way with the same 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.610
 essence of this video game so look 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.320
 play guys who are android not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 let's do as I say the analysis 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 of this exquisite and addictive video game 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.650
 web on the one hand we have the menu we do 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 a gesture such that this and from here 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.100
 we have all the settings for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.900
 configure this application the truth that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 it does not have anything very cool melodies 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.799
 we can activate and deactivate sounds today 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.629
 we can go to the game center to see a 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.760
 little our classification and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.320
 our friends then the most part 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.700
 important let's give it to play for 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 that you see a little bit that first 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.380
 we find a map of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.420
 where we will be able to play here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 a multitude of current phases more 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.040
 complicated then we have a face sees that 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.720
 when we complete the bases the phases 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.760
 normal we will be able to play here a 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.850
 continuous mode good as you see here 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 we have more difficulty levels let 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.060
 to play by the beginning to explain 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.670
 a little bit because it will be much more to me 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.080
 easy to notice that the game consists 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.550
 in the following we click on the part 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.110
 right and we rotate in this direction 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.630
 we click on the left side and we notice 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.370
 that in the previous sense simply 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.900
 is this and figures are appearing 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.090
 with metrics that we are going to have 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.800
 that dodge how are you going to see now let's go 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.060
 to start a game we will see here 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.280
 the first geometric figure appears 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.900
 this is the first screen is pretty 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.490
 simple but then we have to go 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.780
 dodging as you see here all these 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 committed figures that are going 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 showing up we do not have to be pretty 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.750
 skillful as I say this is the first 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.160
 I hope you are already understanding a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.350
 What is the video game? 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.240
 this screen is very easy to pass as 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.649
 you see let's go some a little more 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 complicated for you to see a little bit 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.100
 because the essence of this video game is not 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.570
 one of those addictive games that do not 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.580
 you can stop playing that has a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.620
 sequence in each of these missions 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.090
 or screens and we have to memorize 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.870
 obviously that sequence to get 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.540
 happen 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 and the truth is that I go and it's enough 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.140
 complicated and you have to make authentic 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.030
 adventures notice that the pieces are already 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.890
 going down pretty fast let's see if 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 we got to give a little bit of good and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.209
 you guys already know that we in the end 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.769
 so we ask you if you have this 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.959
 video game send us a little bit all 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.849
 your results let's see we are going to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.310
 play to see a little bit let's do it 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.200
 ok let's see let's see here we 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.819
 this appears here is that it is very 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.110
 complicated good guys if you want 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.579
