00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
here let's take a little review of this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
here let's take a little review of this
so<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.390> basically<00:01:27.600> demonstrated<00:01:28.560> halo<00:01:28.860> 4<00:01:29.100> on

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so they basically demonstrated halo 4 on

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
so they basically demonstrated halo 4 on
a<00:01:29.430> streaming<00:01:30.180> service<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.170> know

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
a streaming service so if you don't know

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
a streaming service so if you don't know
what<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> streaming<00:01:31.680> service<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> cloud<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
what a streaming service what a cloud is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
what a streaming service what a cloud is
it's<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:33.900> where<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.710> run<00:01:35.009> everything

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it's basically where they run everything

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's basically where they run everything
on<00:01:35.790> their<00:01:36.000> server<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> could<00:01:36.930> run<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> super

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
on their server so you could run a super

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.300 
on their server so you could run a super
high-speed<00:01:38.549> heavy<00:01:39.390> duty<00:01:39.840> graphic<00:01:40.560> game<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
high-speed heavy duty graphic game on

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
high-speed heavy duty graphic game on
your<00:01:42.090> Windows<00:01:42.600> Phone<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.259> any<00:01:43.860> phone

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
your Windows Phone or on any phone

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
your Windows Phone or on any phone
really<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.700> long<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.630> surface

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
really as long as you have the surface

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
really as long as you have the surface
like<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.560> life<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.520> happens<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like on life basically what happens is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
like on life basically what happens is
they<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.420> transmit<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> picture<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
they just transmit the picture to you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
they just transmit the picture to you
and<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.880> basically<00:01:51.060> send<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> controls<00:01:52.140> back

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and you basically send the controls back

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.899 
and you basically send the controls back
to<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.399> clicking<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
to them like what you're clicking and
stuff<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> they've<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> point

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
stuff and they've got it to the point

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
stuff and they've got it to the point
where<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.909> noticeable<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.509> play

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
where it's not really noticeable I play

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
where it's not really noticeable I play
just<00:01:57.990> cause<00:01:58.049> 2<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> hundred<00:01:59.009> hours<00:01:59.369> on

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
live on a streaming service so that's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980
