00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.350 
directional shape as really stiff and
responsive<00:00:15.309> so<00:00:16.309> it's<00:00:16.880> going<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.060> be<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:17.210> nice

powerful board if you're into your free
riding<00:00:19.039> into<00:00:19.369> your<00:00:19.520> free<00:00:19.910> carving<00:00:20.300> it's<00:00:21.020> got

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
riding into your free carving it's got

riding into your free carving it's got
never<00:00:21.380> summers<00:00:21.770> RC<00:00:22.730> camera<00:00:23.150> technology<00:00:23.390> which

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
never summers RC camera technology which

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.109 
never summers RC camera technology which
basically<00:00:24.289> is<00:00:24.619> reverse<00:00:25.400> camber<00:00:25.699> in<00:00:25.880> between

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
basically is reverse camber in between

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.820 
basically is reverse camber in between
the<00:00:26.210> bindings<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.839> then<00:00:26.960> regular<00:00:27.320> camber<00:00:27.529> on

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
the bindings and then regular camber on

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.980 
the bindings and then regular camber on
the<00:00:27.920> tip<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.220> tail<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.000> basically<00:00:29.750> you've

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
the tip and the tail so basically you've

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.870 
the tip and the tail so basically you've
got<00:00:30.289> it's<00:00:30.650> nice<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.220> loose<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:31.699> you're<00:00:31.820> at

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
got it's nice and loose when you're at

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.790 
got it's nice and loose when you're at
low<00:00:31.999> speed<00:00:32.330> and<00:00:32.689> nice<00:00:32.990> and<00:00:33.080> maneuverable<00:00:33.650> but

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
low speed and nice and maneuverable but

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.080 
low speed and nice and maneuverable but
then<00:00:34.070> when<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.190> want<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.460> step<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.760> up<00:00:34.850> you

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
of top seed to my sports normally you've

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.690 
of top seed to my sports normally you've
got<00:00:50.660> like<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.810> glossy<00:00:51.320> glossy<00:00:52.190> finish<00:00:52.430> it's<00:00:52.580> got

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
got like a glossy glossy finish it's got

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.640 
got like a glossy glossy finish it's got
carbonium<00:00:53.240> top<00:00:53.450> sheet<00:00:53.660> which<00:00:53.900> is<00:00:54.170> scratch

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
carbonium top sheet which is scratch

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.890 
carbonium top sheet which is scratch
resistant<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.760> you're<00:00:56.330> not<00:00:56.450> going<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.630> get<00:00:56.720> so

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
resistant so you're not going to get so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.330 
resistant so you're not going to get so
many<00:00:57.020> chips<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.590> stuff<00:00:57.650> in<00:00:57.860> your<00:00:57.950> board<00:00:58.160> when

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
many chips and stuff in your board when

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560 
many chips and stuff in your board when
you're<00:00:58.490> in<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.610> lift<00:00:58.760> queues<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.330> skiers

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
you're in the lift queues and skiers

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.330 
you're in the lift queues and skiers
come<00:00:59.810> over<00:01:00.020> board<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:00.380> not<00:01:00.500> going<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.680> be<00:01:00.830> not

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
come over board it's not going to be not

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.310 
come over board it's not going to be not
going<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.550> be<00:01:01.610> so<00:01:01.730> bad<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.270> it's<00:01:03.140> also

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
going to be so bad with this it's also

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.280 
going to be so bad with this it's also
got<00:01:03.590> our<00:01:03.830> carbonium<00:01:04.549> are<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.080> base

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
got our carbonium are in the in the base

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.550 
got our carbonium are in the in the base
itself<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.850> you've<00:01:08.119> got<00:01:08.150> X<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.900> car<00:01:09.140> carbon

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
itself so you've got X the car carbon

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.350 
itself so you've got X the car carbon
X's<00:01:09.920> under<00:01:10.130> your<00:01:10.280> bindings<00:01:10.700> which<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.240> going

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
X's under your bindings which is going

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.300 
X's under your bindings which is going
to<00:01:11.420> give<00:01:11.480> you<00:01:11.660> really<00:01:12.020> quick<00:01:12.530> edge<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:12.830> edge

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
to give you really quick edge to edge

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.910 
to give you really quick edge to edge
response<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.780> it's<00:01:15.230> just<00:01:15.410> going<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.560> be<00:01:15.620> really

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
response so it's just going to be really

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.590 
response so it's just going to be really
powerful<00:01:16.070> really<00:01:16.790> responsive<00:01:17.330> while<00:01:17.450> you're

powerful really responsive while you're
carving<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:19.040> got<00:01:19.400> see<00:01:20.270> CD<00:01:21.140> s<00:01:21.260> dampening

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
carving it's got see CD s dampening

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.430 
carving it's got see CD s dampening
which<00:01:22.310> basically<00:01:23.030> gives<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> nice<00:01:24.050> damn
