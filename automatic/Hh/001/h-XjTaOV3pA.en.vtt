00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.589 
create something from scratch you don't
actually<00:03:49.829> have<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.280> start<00:03:50.609> with<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> photo<00:03:51.419> to

actually have to start with a photo to
use<00:03:51.840> Photoshop<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.709> scratch<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:53.790> can

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
use Photoshop you can scratch you can

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.689 
use Photoshop you can scratch you can
start<00:03:54.150> from<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.419> blank<00:03:54.590> canvas<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:56.519> can

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
start from a blank canvas and you can

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.689 
start from a blank canvas and you can
create<00:03:56.909> layers<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.720> all<00:03:57.810> sorts<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.169> stuff<00:03:58.699> you

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
create layers and all sorts of stuff you

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.979 
create layers and all sorts of stuff you
know<00:03:59.819> for<00:04:00.000> digital<00:04:00.299> artists<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.750> all<00:04:00.810> that

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
know for digital artists and all that

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.710 
know for digital artists and all that
stuff<00:04:01.199> so<00:04:01.229> you<00:04:02.010> know<00:04:02.129> it's<00:04:02.579> just<00:04:02.699> a<00:04:03.090> tool<00:04:03.510> for

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
stuff so you know it's just a tool for

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.420 
stuff so you know it's just a tool for
photographers<00:04:04.349> but<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.799> not<00:04:04.949> just<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.280> two

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
photographers but it's not just the two

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.569 
photographers but it's not just the two
photographers<00:04:06.269> it's<00:04:06.449> a<00:04:06.629> tool<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.620> even<00:04:08.370> more

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
photographers it's a tool for even more

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.280 
photographers it's a tool for even more
advanced<00:04:09.030> stuff<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:09.659> that's<00:04:09.840> why<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
advanced stuff and so that's why a

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.280 
advanced stuff and so that's why a
Photoshop<00:04:11.099> overall<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.299> more<00:04:12.509> powerful<00:04:13.079> for

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
Photoshop overall is more powerful for

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.960 
Photoshop overall is more powerful for
image<00:04:13.560> editing<00:04:13.709> retouching<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.699> all<00:04:14.759> that

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
image editing retouching and all that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.629 
image editing retouching and all that
stuff<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:16.380> what<00:04:16.590> would<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.799> recommend<00:04:17.130> well

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
stuff so what would I recommend well

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.099 
stuff so what would I recommend well
like<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.299> said<00:04:18.449> if<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.900> only<00:04:19.109> have<00:04:19.409> you<00:04:20.070> know

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
like I said if you only have you know

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.870 
like I said if you only have you know
two<00:04:22.109> by<00:04:22.260> one<00:04:22.620> software<00:04:23.099> I<00:04:23.219> think<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.729> should

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
two by one software I think you should

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.020 
two by one software I think you should
go<00:04:23.969> for<00:04:24.150> Lightroom<00:04:24.510> first

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
go for Lightroom first

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.140 
go for Lightroom first
because<00:04:25.210> firstly<00:04:26.020> cheaper<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.820> get<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
because firstly cheaper and you get that

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150 
because firstly cheaper and you get that
photo<00:04:28.630> management<00:04:29.110> aspect<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.889> I<00:04:30.100> think

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
photo management aspect that I think

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.450 
photo management aspect that I think
that<00:04:30.550> every<00:04:30.940> everyone<00:04:31.690> should<00:04:31.990> have<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.530> use<00:04:33.340> it

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
that every everyone should have I use it

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.920 
that every everyone should have I use it
myself<00:04:33.610> even<00:04:34.030> though<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.270> don't<00:04:34.360> take<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.840> know

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
myself even though I don't take you know

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.620 
myself even though I don't take you know
tons<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.500> tons<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.889> tons<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.190> photos<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:36.790> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
tons and tons and tons of photos but I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.500 
tons and tons and tons of photos but I
do<00:04:37.750> find<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.200> very<00:04:38.410> useful<00:04:39.000> if<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.300> have

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
do find it very useful if you do have

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.090 
do find it very useful if you do have
the<00:04:40.630> money<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.169> do<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:43.290> lot<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.320> retouching

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
the money and you do a lot of retouching

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.980 
the money and you do a lot of retouching
and<00:04:45.250> advanced<00:04:45.910> editing<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.720> should

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
and advanced editing you should

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.129 
and advanced editing you should
eventually<00:04:47.680> invest<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.430> Photoshop<00:04:48.880> because

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
eventually invest in Photoshop because

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.140 
eventually invest in Photoshop because
it's<00:04:50.139> a<00:04:50.200> much<00:04:50.830> more<00:04:51.040> powerful<00:04:51.100> tool<00:04:51.790> for<00:04:52.030> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
it's a much more powerful tool for that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.530 
it's a much more powerful tool for that
and<00:04:52.680> like<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.710> said<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.980> while<00:04:54.040> ago<00:04:54.190> um<00:04:54.580> sometimes

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
and like I said a while ago um sometimes

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.750 
and like I said a while ago um sometimes
people<00:04:55.930> just<00:04:55.960> use<00:04:56.530> Lightroom<00:04:56.830> actually<00:04:57.460> for

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
people just use Lightroom actually for

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.870 
people just use Lightroom actually for
photo<00:04:58.480> management<00:04:59.460> application<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.700> they

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
photo management application and they

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.120 
photo management application and they
maybe<00:05:01.210> do<00:05:01.570> some<00:05:01.810> basic<00:05:01.990> editing<00:05:02.500> but<00:05:03.010> then

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
maybe do some basic editing but then

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.440 
maybe do some basic editing but then
after<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.460> they<00:05:03.640> bring<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.120> good<00:05:04.270> file

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
after that they bring the good file

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.270 
after that they bring the good file
straight<00:05:04.780> into<00:05:05.080> Photoshop<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:05.980> know<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.100> lot

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
straight into Photoshop you know a lot

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.860 
straight into Photoshop you know a lot
of<00:05:06.310> people<00:05:06.640> do<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.970> simply<00:05:07.630> because

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
of people do that simply because

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.830 
of people do that simply because
Photoshop<00:05:08.169> is<00:05:08.560> very<00:05:09.130> powerful<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:10.720> that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
Photoshop is very powerful but that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.409
