00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.069 
make sure your lids on nice and tight
always<00:01:49.500> start<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.009> low<00:01:50.540> turn<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.990> we're

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
always start on low turn it on and we're

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:07.870 
always start on low turn it on and we're
gonna<00:01:52.200> turn<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> five

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.330 

I'm<00:02:08.690> gonna<00:02:08.810> add<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> little<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:09.800> water<00:02:10.069> in

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
I'm gonna add a little more water in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.740 
I'm gonna add a little more water in
there<00:02:10.520> cuz<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:10.910> sounding<00:02:11.239> like<00:02:11.300> it's<00:02:11.569> not

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
there cuz it's sounding like it's not

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.660 
there cuz it's sounding like it's not
quite<00:02:12.230> blending<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> way<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.069> want<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.489> to<00:02:13.610> I

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
quite blending the way I want it to I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
quite blending the way I want it to I
want<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> run<00:02:14.270> real<00:02:14.480> smoothly<00:02:14.900> not<00:02:15.200> jumping

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
want it to run real smoothly not jumping

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.699 
want it to run real smoothly not jumping
around<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.010> blender<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:17.480> more<00:02:17.750> it

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
around in the blender a little more it

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.380 
around in the blender a little more it
should<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.190> consistency<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:20.000> salad

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
should be the consistency of a salad

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.550 
should be the consistency of a salad
dressing<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.750> think<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:21.440> it's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
dressing so think of it that way if it's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.930 
dressing so think of it that way if it's
real<00:02:21.800> thick<00:02:22.099> it's<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.310> going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.640> pour<00:02:22.819> as

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
real thick it's not going to pour as

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.729 
real thick it's not going to pour as
easily<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.500> thin

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
easily but you don't want it so thin

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:55.990 
easily but you don't want it so thin
that<00:02:24.769> it's<00:02:24.980> gonna<00:02:25.099> be<00:02:25.250> soupy

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.450 

okay<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.480> perfect<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.290> could<00:02:58.470> see<00:02:58.710> from

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
okay that is perfect you could see from

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.980 
okay that is perfect you could see from
the<00:02:59.819> blending<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.630> actually

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
the blending that it was actually

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.800 
the blending that it was actually
creating<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.830> vortex<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:03.270> what<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> want

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
creating a vortex so that's what I want

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
creating a vortex so that's what I want
when<00:03:03.959> I'm<00:03:04.080> blending<00:03:04.260> sauces<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.920> don't<00:03:05.100> want<00:03:05.220> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
when I'm blending sauces I don't want it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
when I'm blending sauces I don't want it
to<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.430> jumping<00:03:05.819> around<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.150> getting<00:03:06.300> stuck<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
to be jumping around and getting stuck I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390 
to be jumping around and getting stuck I
want<00:03:07.260> there<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.410> be<00:03:07.500> enough<00:03:07.800> water<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.280> there

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
want there to be enough water in there

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220 
want there to be enough water in there
that<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.700> spinning<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.390> also<00:03:09.630> sucking<00:03:10.110> it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
that it's spinning and also sucking it

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.449 
that it's spinning and also sucking it
down<00:03:10.350> into<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> middle<00:03:10.920> which<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.069> called<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
down into the middle which is called the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.760 
down into the middle which is called the
vortex<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.540> wanted<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.350> its<00:03:13.470> own

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
vortex so I wanted to do that on its own

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.100 
vortex so I wanted to do that on its own
without<00:03:13.980> my<00:03:14.310> help<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.850> sauce<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.870> one

right away you can also blend it a

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.759 
right away you can also blend it a
little<00:03:35.850> longer<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.480> warm<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.959> way<00:03:37.110> or<00:03:37.590> you

can also use a food dehydrator you can
put<00:03:39.720> your<00:03:39.900> enchilada<00:03:40.739> tamale<00:03:41.190> back<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.390> there

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
put your enchilada tamale back in there

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.930 
put your enchilada tamale back in there
and<00:03:43.100> dehydrate<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.310> make<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.580> warm<00:03:44.850> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and dehydrate it to make it warm so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.250 
and dehydrate it to make it warm so
there's<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.360> lot<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.630> different<00:03:45.870> tricks<00:03:46.050> you

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
the food to 118 degrees and if you think

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.509 
the food to 118 degrees and if you think
about<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.870> hot<00:03:52.110> tub<00:03:52.380> hot<00:03:52.530> tubs<00:03:52.800> are<00:03:52.980> pretty<00:03:53.250> hot

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
about a hot tub hot tubs are pretty hot

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.000 
about a hot tub hot tubs are pretty hot
and<00:03:53.790> there<00:03:54.000> are<00:03:54.060> only<00:03:54.150> 110<00:03:54.690> degrees<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and there are only 110 degrees so you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.470
