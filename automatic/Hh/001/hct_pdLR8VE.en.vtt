00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 Here we set I put the studs 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.350
 bolts 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 will be cool at all well how would that be 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 be more comfortable than ordinary bolts 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 but in general, you do not need to center anything 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 finger and chris wheel just put it on 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 hairpin 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.700
 still awesome well studs how then not well 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.640
 it bolts air 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.640
 cylinder heads vaz 2108 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 he looked like that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.840
 bolt well there well in general yes sos on the channel 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 but in general they are not very expensive here 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.479
 this garbage saw off and it turns out we 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 in the clinic, well, better than all the same 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.470
 digest so they stood tough 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 because they have some weird 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.350
 backlash about shorter take welding on both sides 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:26.900
 and everything is hard not hanging out anywhere 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 all set off not to okay this go further 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.990
 as for bipods now i'm here's another 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 I made these couplings but 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 hobby but they fuck so long not 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.229
 I need a figure for security officers 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.890
 especially there you will not come and so 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.890
 concerns 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 pivoting arms 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.140
 lever arm 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:06.719
 here is such a crap curve that's this garbage 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.879
 cut out then take the turn 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.590
 the other side and it turns out we have this 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:18.540
 awesome so here so should 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 it turns out I get here cut in 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.310
 about two centimeters in total output to 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.500
 right side yes it turns out 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.750
 maximum rests on this evening 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.030
 no 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.900
 Stabilizer is such garbage that's just 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:45.200
 about to run 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.200
 okay bye everyone 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.500
 so passed and look at this cat 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.840
 this is the wrong angle here 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.970
 the wrong thing is that when you put 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.450
 on the car here if you put one on 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.280
 the car then it will be this part 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.580
 balk about support 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.900
 well, we don't need this that is why i 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:18.280
 guy and a half hours and regulated 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.710
 what kind of engineering angle is needed 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.980
 Education me while I do not have in general 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.260
 happened here is just such a drying 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.000
 did not know hard enough like 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.620
 welded the collapse should not be painted and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 and that's how I got you right now 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:50.370
 show you what we do on the most 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:54.870
 car like it fits 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.870
 all why so 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:19.699
 so look here here it became here 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:23.370
 Here on a place here there is no pattern and 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:26.360
 so here we have it here 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.660
 it turns out so here if you can see 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.660
 at all 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:41.250
 and now we insert traction here 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:43.470
 delivered so here is all the thrust rose 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.000
 I will turn here even 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:51.150
 enough now I will tie 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.330
 usually no screed needed 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.789
 principle damn there is no light in general, and so 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.530
 it is clear that this is a tie to her 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.560
 there was enough normal standard not on 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 no elongated but principle to 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.800
 more reliable it was calmer a little bit 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.630
 it should be increased but there is literally not 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.880
 knew by one third 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.440
 new all boys 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.440
 we space pack 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.949
 and so the boys drew a little theory 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:36.889
 here our steering is the Lada and 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:39.349
 so what I wanted to say in this here is this 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:45.080
 I get it I drew this 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.619
 the way the old 100 pivot arm 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.800
 fist 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:52.610
 we are here like a knuckle crap there 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:58.569
 in general when turning on standard in 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:05.020
 the steering we get it 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:08.020
 internal so turns external 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.020
 pancake 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:19.519
 so here is the essence of what the essence is that 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:24.439
 here is the angle of the inner wheel turn 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:29.509
 which he comes into this one more than here 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:34.189
 this corner for us to drift 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:40.429
 it does not fit so we replace here 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:45.139
 we replace this drying curve with an even one 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:50.169
 here such that we draw from this 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.169
 found them again 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:03.340
 so here at the turn we 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:06.480
 it turns out that there is no this angle 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.480
 Akkermana and 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:18.130
 the wheels turn smooth 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:21.990
 same degrees and so what else am i 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:25.570
 wanted to say about the length 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:28.350
 the shorter fry get well damn 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:32.980
 doctors threshold for all 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.120
 we quickly turn aside in 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.850
 extreme position 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:42.100
 but we will need more effort than 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.980
 the longer the lever the less effort but 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.680
 longer we will twist this law i'm not 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:51.490
 remember newton or someone and now him 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:57.870
 it does not matter Well, that's something like this and even that 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.870
 we were all stolen
