got a little bit more cheese and towards
the<00:02:08.040> end<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> sandwich<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the end of the sandwich here it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
the end of the sandwich here it
definitely<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.649> unique<00:02:11.070> taste<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.760> little

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
definitely has a unique taste a little

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.510 
definitely has a unique taste a little
sweeter<00:02:12.240> for<00:02:12.690> me<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.620> until<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.250> may<00:02:14.460> be

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
sweeter for me but until that may be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.690 
sweeter for me but until that may be
just<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> sauces<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:16.040> making<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.250> little<00:02:17.400> hard

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
just the sauces or making a little hard

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.110 
just the sauces or making a little hard
to<00:02:17.850> find<00:02:18.740> like<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.070> real<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.490> taste<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to find like the real like taste of the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.090 
to find like the real like taste of the
cheese<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.690> bread<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> bread<00:02:22.260> isn't

cheese and the bread the bread isn't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.730 
cheese and the bread the bread isn't
standing<00:02:23.580> out<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.940> much<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
standing out as much as it was in the

standing out as much as it was in the
last<00:02:25.890> brio<00:02:26.250> sandwich<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.880> reviewed<00:02:27.270> my<00:02:27.600> flavors

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
last brio sandwich I reviewed my flavors

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.230 
last brio sandwich I reviewed my flavors
are<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.950> little<00:02:29.910> complicated

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
are there it's just a little complicated

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.510 
are there it's just a little complicated
know<00:02:30.690> sometimes<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.200> complicated<00:02:31.680> by

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
know sometimes it's just complicated by

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.040 
know sometimes it's just complicated by
me<00:02:32.670> personally<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.120> would<00:02:33.330> say<00:02:33.540> maybe<00:02:33.570> stick

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
me personally I would say maybe stick

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.290 
me personally I would say maybe stick
with<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.410> sauce<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.520> um<00:02:37.790> maybe<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> Mayo

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
with one sauce and um maybe not the Mayo

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.820 
with one sauce and um maybe not the Mayo
in<00:02:39.540> there<00:02:39.690> maybe<00:02:39.840> keep<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.290> sweeter<00:02:40.590> sauce

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
in there maybe keep that sweeter sauce

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.670 
in there maybe keep that sweeter sauce
but<00:02:40.980> take<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> Mayo<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.880> clash<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.420> there

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
but take the Mayo out the clash in there

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.020 
but take the Mayo out the clash in there
masking<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.010> flavors<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> you're<00:02:44.880> trying

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

masking the flavors that you're trying
to<00:02:45.150> get<00:02:45.240> out<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> sandwich<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.020> what<00:02:46.320> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
to get out of the sandwich and what it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.949 
to get out of the sandwich and what it
almost<00:02:46.620> starts<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.040> taste<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.959> almost

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
almost starts to taste like is almost

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.420 
almost starts to taste like is almost
when<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.230> get<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.590> fish<00:02:49.860> sandwich<00:02:50.100> at

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
when you get a fish sandwich at

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.090 
when you get a fish sandwich at
McDonald's<00:02:50.970> or<00:02:51.060> something<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.010> have

like a load of tartar sauce which in

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.570 
like a load of tartar sauce which in
that<00:02:55.320> example<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.920> fine<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.489> this

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
that example it's fine but in this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610 
that example it's fine but in this
situation<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.019> maybe<00:02:58.290> too<00:02:58.530> much

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
situation is a little maybe too much

complimenting much I mean it's having a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.370 
complimenting much I mean it's having a
little<00:03:03.060> zing<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.600> Mayo<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.140> it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
little zing with the Mayo but it's it's

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
masking the cheese you're not really

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.759 
masking the cheese you're not really
tasting<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.750> onion<00:03:07.080> unless<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.500> happen<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
tasting the onion unless you happen to

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
hit a dry spot in the sandwich where

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.720 
hit a dry spot in the sandwich where
there's<00:03:09.480> no<00:03:09.570> sauce<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.370> would<00:03:11.580> actually

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
there's no sauce so I would actually

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.130 
there's no sauce so I would actually
kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.060> prefer<00:03:12.300> less<00:03:12.510> sauce<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> could

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
kind of prefer less sauce so I could

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.240
