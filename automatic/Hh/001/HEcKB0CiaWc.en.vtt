00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
here so when you flip him around like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.120 
here so when you flip him around like
this<00:01:51.390> he's<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> bulldozer<00:01:52.770> as

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
this he's now kind of a bulldozer as

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
this he's now kind of a bulldozer as
well<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:54.149> even<00:01:54.420> better<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
well and an even better thing is this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
well and an even better thing is this
thing<00:01:55.740> comes<00:01:56.040> off<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
thing comes off and you can use it to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.080 
thing comes off and you can use it to
scoop<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.229> mold<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.890> other<00:01:59.159> shapes<00:01:59.820> and

one<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.530> neat<00:04:07.710> things<00:04:07.740> about<00:04:08.220> these

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
one of the neat things about these

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.610 
one of the neat things about these
bricks<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> way<00:04:09.300> they're<00:04:09.510> shaped<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.350> can

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
bricks is the way they're shaped you can

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.590 
bricks is the way they're shaped you can
flip<00:04:11.160> them<00:04:11.280> around<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.970> kind<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.300> build<00:04:12.510> a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
flip them around and kind of build a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.690 
flip them around and kind of build a
wall<00:04:12.810> out<00:04:13.080> of<00:04:13.230> them<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:13.830> that's<00:04:14.040> another<00:04:14.370> neat

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
wall out of them so that's another neat

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.400 
wall out of them so that's another neat
little<00:04:14.880> idea<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.420> they<00:04:15.630> had<00:04:15.780> thinking<00:04:16.170> about

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
little idea that they had thinking about

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.890 
little idea that they had thinking about
now<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.610> just<00:04:17.700> keep<00:04:17.940> building<00:04:18.150> up<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.780> up

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
now you can just keep building up and up

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900 
now you can just keep building up and up
until<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.380> have<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> nice<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:20.190> constructed

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
until you have a nice little constructed

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.960 
until you have a nice little constructed
wall<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.450> then<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:22.980> take<00:04:23.190> old<00:04:23.490> chopper

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
wall and then you can take old chopper

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.520 
wall and then you can take old chopper
here<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.480> either<00:04:25.670> destroy<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.910> wall<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:27.530> just

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
here and either destroy the wall or just

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.990 
here and either destroy the wall or just
kind<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.520> know<00:04:29.670> grab<00:04:30.060> pieces<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.900> and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
kind of you know grab pieces of it and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.850 
kind of you know grab pieces of it and
just<00:04:33.000> build<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.570> sorts<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.050> stuff<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.530> so

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
just build all sorts of stuff with it so

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.980 
just build all sorts of stuff with it so
it's<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.460> versatile<00:04:36.030> in<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.570> things<00:04:36.840> that

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
it's so versatile in the things that

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.960 
it's so versatile in the things that
this<00:04:37.170> little<00:04:37.440> set<00:04:37.650> can<00:04:37.890> do<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.310> can<00:04:38.790> just

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
this little set can do I can just

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.260 
this little set can do I can just
imagine<00:04:39.140> hours<00:04:40.140> upon<00:04:40.530> hours<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.130> playable<00:04:41.970> fun

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
imagine hours upon hours of playable fun

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.440 
imagine hours upon hours of playable fun
time<00:04:42.890> testing<00:04:43.890> out<00:04:44.040> its<00:04:44.220> front<00:04:44.550> cab<00:04:44.850> mold<00:04:45.210> I

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
time testing out its front cab mold I

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.960 
time testing out its front cab mold I
took<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> little<00:04:46.200> bit<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.770> black<00:04:47.040> sparkle

of the box if you're really creative you

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.860 
of the box if you're really creative you
can<00:05:01.590> kind<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.890> mix<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.370> two<00:05:02.520> together<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.840> I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
can kind of mix the two together but I

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.230 
can kind of mix the two together but I
just<00:05:04.110> don't<00:05:04.350> see<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.710> happening<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.670> I'm
