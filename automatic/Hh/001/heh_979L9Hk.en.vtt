00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.380
 the goal 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.320
 what did you think of the machine will it 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.730
 appear very different from the normal 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.770
 goalkeeping coach 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.040
 I think she's a complicated machine. 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.440
 because besides some buttons so that 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.320
 change the direction of the ball she can say 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.400
 make curves and complicate our lives and 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 sometimes it can hurt but it seemed 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.550
 that she comes with a stronger kick changes 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.760
 much compared to the preparer 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.100
 tradition changes because a good kick 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.010
 very strong sometimes it only increases the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.970
 speed and it can go up to 150 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.070
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.260
 and you already managed to make a defense 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.460
 the teacher is well 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.680
 different to train 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.140
 I do not think with the help of my 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.880
 coaches I was able to do is already a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.920
 working with this machine is a 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.009
 interesting we have as a 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 mechanism to support the work also 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.580
 depends a lot on the creativity of each 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.610
 But we did a lot of research. 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 various ways of working with 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.720
 she is certainly a cynic in the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.670
 goalkeeper preparation 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 it runs away from the specificity of the 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.950
 goalkeeper kick can not analyze 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 well the kick but she works 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.650
 in that vision of surprise the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.270
 goalkeeper she gives a surprise because she 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.700
 no movement is our movement 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.670
 but it does several different curves 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.010
 we have to direct this curve is 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.420
 both manually but is one is a 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.850
 machine that today I think not 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.710
 modern training of repetitions and 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.549
 by the physical burden we have on 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 training 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.750
 it certainly comes to enrich the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.390
 our age training process 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.189
 evidence that it remains here in the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.400
 ahead with sure it's part of it 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.549
 now that she she will see the right club 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.100
 not bad it is decided there on the top 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.590
 nÃ© from the board everything but only 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.420
 they look like goalkeeper trainer in 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.269
 first week we're using 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.700
 it's being beneficial I think the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.320
 and even with the beginning of the year she us 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.000
 will get an interesting report 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.000
 It is beneficial for us to keep it. 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.750
 the fan 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.750
