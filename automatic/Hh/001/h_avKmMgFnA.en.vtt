00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.620
 multicooker is a very necessary thing for 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.719
 people of different types of employment for employees 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.759
 work it can save unnecessary 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.160
 half an hour an hour on cooking for 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.080
 Mummies is generally an irreplaceable thing she 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.490
 and yogurt to do and steamed vegetables 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.470
 will cook and we have the opportunity 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.910
 look at the sample multicooker 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.649
 moulinex brand 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.660
 and find out if she really is 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.189
 good as they say white 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 surely to face moulinex 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.410
 emg 81 2132 and a combination of silver 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.690
 metallic makes the look 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.190
 modern and fresh multicooker facial 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.320
 the part is made of decorative 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.480
 metal strip of the same color white 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.140
 metallic everything else is made of 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.970
 plastic 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 all controls are on 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.990
 housing front top here 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 all manipulations are performed 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.040
 this remote is equipped with the usual not 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.200
 word touch buttons and dustproof protection 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.150
 they will withstand pressed dirty wet 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.399
 hands in the center is large 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.470
 plastic-covered screen but in fact itself 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.540
 the display is quite small the rest is under 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.579
 glass icons backlit above the screen 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.329
 there is a button that opens the cover 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.460
 multicookers 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.799
 on the very cover there is a huge eliminator 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.869
 to contemplate the cooking process and 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.429
 This is a good attempt to make a slow cooker. 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.469
 not like most but with 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.270
 cooking this window is fogging up 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.009
 and almost nothing you can see 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.729
 cook so good try 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.859
 moulinex 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.570
 except the transparent cover and there is also a pen 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.520
 for transfer 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.350
 and the legs are rubberized only on the back 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.060
 about the front moulinex decided not 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.070
 bother because two rubber bands 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.320
 enough that the device does not slide 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.540
 even when you open the lid power wire 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.770
 connects to the side so multi can 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 close to the wall 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.970
 additional power switch 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 there is no power supply so turning on the outlet 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 you will immediately light the display is ready for 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.479
 happens in a five-liter saucepan with 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.400
 non-stick coating her form is very 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.140
 interesting and like a pot that 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.390
 allows heat more evenly 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.250
 distributed inside with 3d effect 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.170
 so it is likely that the dish 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.180
 will burn much less again 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.100
 made grooved again so nothing 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.710
 did not stick and evenly prepared 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.690
 walls and 6 ply metal with a thickness of 2 s 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.729
 half millimeter inside 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.709
 Multivarki repeats the shape of the pot 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 the entire heating surface is made of 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.390
 there is no metal pan handle and special 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.250
 clamp forceps included too so 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.709
 take out it will have to hands therefore 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 just please be tack internal 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.760
 part of the cover is removable to her 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.440
 could wash the pan by the way and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.780
 the cover can be washed dishwasher 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 software filling is wide enough 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.920
 but it is not difficult and anything 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.750
 cook you need to choose the type of product and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.740
 what you don't want to do or choose 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.990
 one of several pre-installed 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.880
 only 15 modes are alive here also for 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 many modes separately select the type 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 the product that we will prepare in the end 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.910
 45 programs are obtained including the program 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.010
 a multi-cook which enables 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.620
 manually program multivan 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.270
 besides this there is a 24-hour timer 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860
 delayed start and function 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.290
 maintain heat after cooking 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.480
 also very necessary and interesting feature 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.820
 is warming up a cold meal 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.410
 which is very useful example for 100 out loud 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.670
 from the fridge it can be immediately 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.350
 warm up the slow cooker 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.450
 as I said in this multicooker 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.310
 you can cook a lot of everything from 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.500
 homemade roast to diet 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.760
 yogurt dish so baked 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580
 inside and sides 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.490
 power device 752 a maximum 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.500
 temperature of 160 degrees still here 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.270
 implemented technology phase logzhik 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.250
 which automatically adjusts 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.960
 cooking temperature and duration 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.910
 in the process of working for optimal 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.130
 result set with the slow cooker goes 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.680
 small plastic spoon spatula 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.020
 79 color recipe book 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.840
 glass and basket for double boiler 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.430
 by the way I will share with you one secret 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.500
 corn turns out much tastier if 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.240
 cook and in a double boiler rather than just 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.370
 pots and since i already have 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.020
 prepared double boiler and hungry 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 film crew why don't we 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.940
 cook some healthy food on 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.940
 a couple

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.110
 Moscow 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.780
 essentially moulinex 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.370
 enkei 812 is a multicooker with huge 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.949
