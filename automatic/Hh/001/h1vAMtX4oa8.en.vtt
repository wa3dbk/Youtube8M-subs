00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
were trying to see what the total range

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
were trying to see what the total range
was<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> vehicle<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.830> electric<00:01:26.280> range

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
was of the vehicle so the electric range

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
was of the vehicle so the electric range
plus<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> petrol<00:01:28.170> generator<00:01:28.650> kicks<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
plus when the petrol generator kicks in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
plus when the petrol generator kicks in
and<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> charges<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> battery<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.079> drive

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and and charges the battery as you drive

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.250 
and and charges the battery as you drive
see<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.369> far<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.970> go

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
see how far we can go

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.650 
see how far we can go
on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> total<00:01:34.860> trip<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:36.210> drove<00:01:36.390> from

vault<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.750> has<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> range<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.680> 80

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
vault it has a range of up to 80

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.790 
vault it has a range of up to 80
kilometers<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:54.090> electric<00:01:54.900> driving<00:01:55.440> before

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
kilometers on electric driving before

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.740 
kilometers on electric driving before
the<00:01:56.130> engine<00:01:56.490> kicks<00:01:56.760> in<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.120> that<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.450> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the engine kicks in is that right that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.680 
the engine kicks in is that right that's
right<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.160> it's<00:01:59.940> called<00:02:00.120> an<00:02:00.300> extended

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
right so we have it's called an extended

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.830 
right so we have it's called an extended
range<00:02:01.050> electric<00:02:01.410> vehicle<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.810> only

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
range electric vehicle so we not only

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.320 
range electric vehicle so we not only
have<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.350> electric<00:02:05.010> range<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.820> plug<00:02:06.120> the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
have the electric range so you plug the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.690 
have the electric range so you plug the
car<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> charge<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.410> up<00:02:07.530> four<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> five

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
car in and charge it up four to five

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.840 
car in and charge it up four to five
hours<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> then<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.980> go<00:02:11.130> up<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.400> 18

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
hours and then you can go up to 18

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.080 
hours and then you can go up to 18
kilometers<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> charge<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
kilometers on a charge and then when the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.160 
kilometers on a charge and then when the
battery<00:02:15.420> goes<00:02:15.540> flat

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
battery goes flat

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.990 
battery goes flat
the<00:02:16.380> petrol<00:02:16.890> generator<00:02:17.340> kicks<00:02:17.820> in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the petrol generator kicks in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.420 
the petrol generator kicks in
automatically<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.050> charges<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.100> battery

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
automatically and charges your battery

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850 
automatically and charges your battery
as<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> drive<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
as you drive so it can get you out to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.130 
as you drive so it can get you out to
over<00:02:23.040> 600<00:02:23.700> kilometres<00:02:24.120> okay<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:25.020> very

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
over 600 kilometres okay so that's very

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380 
over 600 kilometres okay so that's very
different<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.490> lot<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.730> other<00:02:26.910> electric

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
different than a lot of other electric

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.420 
different than a lot of other electric
cars<00:02:27.600> that's<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.380> when<00:02:28.590> an<00:02:28.740> electric

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
cars that's right so when an electric

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
cars that's right so when an electric
car<00:02:29.640> when<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> goes<00:02:30.090> flat<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.320> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
car when it goes flat that's it you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
car when it goes flat that's it you
can't<00:02:31.680> go<00:02:31.830> any<00:02:32.040> further<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.550> you're<00:02:32.700> taking<00:02:33.030> a

in terms of you don't have to worry so
much<00:02:46.020> about<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.740> petrol<00:02:47.340> stations<00:02:47.850> once

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
much about going to petrol stations once

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.199 
much about going to petrol stations once
a<00:02:48.240> week<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.730> plugging<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
a week but it's just like plugging in

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.449 
a week but it's just like plugging in
your<00:02:51.239> electric<00:02:51.690> phone<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
your electric phone so when you get it

in you pull into the garage and plug it
in<00:02:57.050> tell<00:02:58.050> me<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> bit<00:02:58.230> about<00:02:58.350> how<00:02:58.620> an<00:02:58.739> electric

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
in tell me a bit about how an electric

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.680 
in tell me a bit about how an electric
car<00:02:59.280> works<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.610> terms<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.940> acceleration<00:03:00.450> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
car works in terms of acceleration and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.500 
car works in terms of acceleration and
performance

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
performance

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.350 
performance
so<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.620> has<00:03:02.769> got<00:03:02.920> fantastic<00:03:03.519> performance<00:03:04.209> it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
so this has got fantastic performance it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.930 
so this has got fantastic performance it
drives<00:03:04.629> really<00:03:05.200> well<00:03:05.319> like<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.739> normal<00:03:06.159> car<00:03:06.340> one

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
drives really well like a normal car one

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.149 
drives really well like a normal car one
thing<00:03:07.120> about<00:03:07.330> an<00:03:07.780> electric<00:03:08.530> car<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:08.920> you

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
thing about an electric car is that you

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.740 
thing about an electric car is that you
don't<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:10.000> gearbox

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
don't have the gearbox

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.619 
don't have the gearbox
you<00:03:10.870> have<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.080> planetary<00:03:11.799> gearset<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.420> there's

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
you have a planetary gearset so there's

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.710 
you have a planetary gearset so there's
no<00:03:13.750> gear<00:03:14.019> changes<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> car<00:03:15.330> makes<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.540> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
no gear changes in the car makes it a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.930 
no gear changes in the car makes it a
lot<00:03:17.019> more<00:03:17.200> seamless<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.950> drive<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.549> lot<00:03:18.760> more

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
lot more seamless to drive a lot more

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.890 
lot more seamless to drive a lot more
fun<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.410> some<00:03:20.890> great<00:03:21.160> acceleration<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.720> got

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
fun and some great acceleration it's got

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.860 
fun and some great acceleration it's got
a<00:03:22.930> pretty<00:03:23.349> cool<00:03:24.269> display<00:03:25.269> here<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:25.660> well

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
a pretty cool display here as well

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.690 
a pretty cool display here as well
what's<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.319> display<00:03:26.799> telling<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> telling

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
what's this display telling that telling

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
what's this display telling that telling
the<00:03:27.790> driver<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.860> display<00:03:30.430> here<00:03:30.879> is<00:03:31.000> which

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
the driver so the display here is which

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.080 
the driver so the display here is which
way<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.140> energy<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.650> going<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.310> we<00:03:33.459> also<00:03:33.670> have

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
way the energy is going so we also have

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.500 
way the energy is going so we also have
the<00:03:34.739> added<00:03:35.739> ability<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.610> recharging<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the added ability of recharging the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.970 
the added ability of recharging the
battery<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.590> vehicle<00:03:38.980> slows<00:03:39.280> down<00:03:40.980> so

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
battery as the vehicle slows down so

battery as the vehicle slows down so
this<00:03:42.160> tells<00:03:42.549> us<00:03:42.790> whether<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.480> tower<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.930> going

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
this tells us whether the tower is going

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.330 
this tells us whether the tower is going
from<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> battery<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.230> wheels<00:03:47.530> or<00:03:47.950> from
