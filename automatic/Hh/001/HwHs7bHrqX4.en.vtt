that's displaying right now Bentley

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.120 
that's displaying right now Bentley
actually<00:03:24.690> created<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.020> as<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> background<00:03:25.740> a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
actually created this as a background a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.100 
actually created this as a background a
desktop<00:03:26.520> background<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:27.870> he's<00:03:27.959> actually

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
desktop background I think he's actually

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.509 
desktop background I think he's actually
going<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.440> make<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> few<00:03:28.739> other<00:03:28.920> modification

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
going to make a few other modification

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.830 
going to make a few other modification
that's<00:03:29.670> because<00:03:29.850> some<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> little

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that's because some of it is a little

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.870 
that's because some of it is a little
bit<00:03:30.989> difficult<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.519> monkey

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
bit difficult to see like the the monkey

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.759 
bit difficult to see like the the monkey
bum<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.269> bottom<00:03:33.540> right<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:33.959> we're<00:03:34.620> going<00:03:34.709> to
