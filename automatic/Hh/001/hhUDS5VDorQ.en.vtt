00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.539
 in this first block we will share with you what for days of 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.780
 field of the company sows in the district of fran in the department of 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 itapúa where several top gun brand technologies were shown for the 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.009
 sorghum cultivation 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 a diversity of options for all tastes and purposes 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.090
 As for the variety of the treasure, they could be observed in a day of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.930
 field organized by the company sows in the selfish French colony always 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.700
 had refused to submit materials for the first time see here in the area 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.400
 the French 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.130
 and it adapts the notebooks 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.710
 where a zone of very strong roots to the block 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.970
 to the sowing of sorghum 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.050
 percent 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.339
 today that some very interesting materials that are from the line tobin 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.800
 there are some non-law that are licensed by norton 15 miles 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.060
 by blind where they where we can where we can the observer in the in 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.520
 this base the brunette of the different materials 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 we are moving one way or the other to certain conditions 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.490
 as regards the varieties of grain sorghum 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.530
 five materials were presented today in granifers we can present as 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.710
 one the materials 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.729
 the 60 that 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.509
 memo as material 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.860
 reads extremely can not performance I think it adapts soil conditions 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.700
 very high 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 sassón soil for this area are the soil for the high zone parana 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.720
 also street in the developing world the san pedro area follows a 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 little more beautiful 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 It is moving very good development 3% and a high material tamino is a material 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.640
 where we can see 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.630
 the very good plant health has 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.090
 we call him a material so plan that it means that you who have 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.330
 a great resistance to amal diseases 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.589
 he is a love 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:13.769
 very good summer load a good a good chub a good behavior of grains 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.079
 the yield per hectare of this material would be around 7 thousand kilos per 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:19.799
 hectare 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.430
 Another one of the materials presented among the graniteros is the top 50 and 12 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.219
 and it is a material with cycles similar to the previous one with good resistance to 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.979
 diseases with tannin content and good adaptation to various types 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:34.959
 of floors 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.959
 especially for central and northern areas of the country 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.150
 a density of 250 to three hundred thousand plants per hectare is recommended 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.509
 for these qualities 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:50.340
 then we went to 3 51 she does not have the characteristic voice on TV 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.359
 for not having path your material also from 110 to 115 days 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.350
 the cycle 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.559
 percent 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:01.959
 It is a very good material but the fashion also semi open has a little 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.239
 more than height 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.620
 has about one meter eighty assault very good also for silage is 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.879
 percent the item is not there that can not be planted to the place there is still 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.930
 Many birds come back for the subject of the tannin lotenal is much more susceptible 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.909
 a has alleged attack birds 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.959
 another option in graniferous sorghum despite tone 48 of white grade without road 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.359
 With good resistance to diseases 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.109
 and that presents a characteristic of owning 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.180
 good protein digestibility and presents degrees with benefits in the industry and 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.929
 animal feeding 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:42.089
 and finally among the mammals there was high 70 which is a sip of 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.929
 double purpose 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:48.649
 but the material that is used much more for silage the 2 70% a height of 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.919
 plant about two meters high 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.899
 It has good percentage of grains can be drawn between 7000 kilos per hectare of 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:56.729
 summer 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.719
 percent 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 a density plant 250 thousand to 500 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.549
 but I was told that I loved 95 seeds per meter 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.089
 percent and on the way 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:14.179
 I'm comfortable with everyone because it's a double purpose material 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.730
 has a voice come to say 'good I have leftover pasture oppressor 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.870
 Gomez has embraced for the minimum 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.239
 he harvested it as grains 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.490
 in a position I need for everything I was missing my animal or reaped as 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.320
 if the singing jec would be talking about a percentage in cunco a harvest of 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.059
 tizimín córdoba 30 tons of material collected 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.580
 among forage sorghums were presented four materials one of 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 they is the board that is a fast bounce material 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.120
 and good palatability of tic presents good forage offer for grazing 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.730
 Some five hundred thousand plants per hectare are recommended. 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.840
 will enable grazing above 60 centimeters 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.650
 next we have the facón that is a very good material what 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.490
 has a characteristic a photosensitive material usa 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.860
 the area and villa despite the 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.020
 that means that with early plantings of September 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.880
 including October for a hundred the flowers 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.199
 by the way the days is a long ball the material 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.039
 percent do not bloom or shape grain 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.610
 hunger hours and when the cantaor by february march when the days to 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.430
 cuartango the madrigal 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.990
 presents the praises the conditions of flowering and form grain 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.860
 percent 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.860
 It also has a density of 500 thousand plants per hectare 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.289
 very good horse 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.039
 very good disease resistance has very good adaptation to the soil by blind 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.039
 an ideal strong firmness 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.460
 to the rollover 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.199
 percent 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.470
 it does not matter the tablet but it is a bit more fibrous because in it 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.219
 reeds a little further 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.150
 then such 2 wood 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.860
 which is an extremely sweet short cycle material ideal for itself 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.279
 what is it and also for grazing 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.849
 yields around 45 thousand kilograms of green material per hectare 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.409
 and finally we have the material that for us, I think it has everything 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:16.909
 potential 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.249
 very big and if it also has its advantage that in a little complicated 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:21.259
 harvest it 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.680
 but other environment 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
 and very yielding 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.469
 the stallion the material that would be around the 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.369
 4 meters and a half five meters high 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:34.529
 percent brooks with five hundred thousand plants per hectare 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.949
 The recommended ones also lied seeds per meter 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.629
 if it really stutters or cuts off a little bit more the stage agency does not have to 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:49.210
 ede that will be with four hundred snacks 50 thousand plants to swell 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:51.780
 to the magenta there have more firm to the overturn 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.250
 as very high material 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.949
 there are always possibilities of tipping over 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.969
 but we already had experiences in such places of excessive of excessive ep storm 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.300
 of wind 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.529
 and not sincerely not surprised that there's never any overturn 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:07.660
 It is a material that 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.369
 which is also very resistant to diseases 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:16.019
 i would be talking about 80 won in Tamil including 100 thousand kilograms 

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.599
 of green matter 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.449
 per hectare in a single cut
