00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
 all right 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.670
 and good to all the boys today we come 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.760
 and we started with minecraft tutorials 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.949
 and good start see I am the master and today 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.800
 we come with a very simple tutorial 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.470
 but 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.699
 I imagine that some will not know 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.100
 because there is always someone who does not 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.140
 knows 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.060
 and is to make a sensor day and night is worth 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.220
 right now I think it was version 1.6 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.360
 points 2 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.270
 they placed this that would be the sensor of 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.570
 light that before that version was a lot 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.570
 more complicated to be the sensor 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.860
 but now mo yan has put it a lot 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.350
 easier and I thank you very much 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.039
 because it's something very useful, we started 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.780
 first how is the sensor done here 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.829
 is the fret you need three 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.399
 glass blocks this three quartz and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.189
 13 wood slap ok and with this 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.200
 we will get the sensor day and night ok 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.440
 the fourth quartz is considered the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 black is usually achieved in 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.960
 the led that this figurine that is here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 this one you picas good you to a quartz 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 or I think it gives you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.649
 drop and I'm random, I think the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.659
 maximum is 3 but if the fourth is left 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.960
 chopping this mineral is found 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.369
 only in the read very well is the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.369
 good is obviously 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.180
 this three blocks of wood in a box 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.000
 of crafting and you get in 6 slaps and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.110
 the glass is made by cooking the sand 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.150
 very well with this we will get the sensor 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830
 day and night 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.620
 ok the next thing we'll need a 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.320
 torch rest that is done with a stick 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.850
 and a powder of rest and quite 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.580
 simple is how to make a torch 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.730
 normal just that the baby charcoal you put 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.540
 a 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.540
 a resource how you get the rest 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.300
 explaining the ore you get more 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.490
 that everything in the depths of the map 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.840
 well the diamond style but a 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.600
 little bit easier 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 - and quite easy since you get European 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.850
 pretty is dust of rest every 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.310
 mineral 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.800
 and good and the last if the distance 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.200
 they want to make the sensor quite long 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.660
 in the light that you want to light 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.510
 we will need a re peter thing that 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.160
 get is that forgiveness is done cooking 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.520
 the stone 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.920
 coulson that gets you to treat the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.590
 stone 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.810
 the torches that the krafft eo to rim 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.390
 mentioned and a little reaction in the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.220
 half will need the repeats 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.670
 and finally we will need a powder 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.670
 straight 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.409
 How to be the simple easy sensor 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.409
 first what are we going to do here 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.170
 the sensor is placed 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.340
 but how do you see the sensor while 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.750
 there is light gives energy and that is not what 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.080
 we want we believe that 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 when there is no light, no one is 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.590
 when not and when the light is not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.680
 energy this and how do we do that with 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.950
 we have to invest energy and how 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.900
 it is done then to that we go as I repeat if 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.069
 they want to do very far they put the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.349
 repeats and so the energy will increase 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.230
 ok as the rudder or energy as this is 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.190
 the easiest thing in the world 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.260
 he puts a torch 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.660
 and torch goes off because the energy 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.160
 causes it to turn off and another 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.350
 dust and the power is off 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.910
 but right now it's not quite night 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.790
 that has not been paid 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.230
 and finally we put the light we want 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.300
 turn on when it is night 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.490
 while and also a curious fact 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:15.170
 The more he has seen, the sun has gone 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.170
 it has gone dark 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.040
 the light then lights up when it is done 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.040
 at daytime 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.490
 sad 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.740
 the energy makes it go off good that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.740
 it does not turn off it turns on but 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.670
 the energy is concentrated here and it makes 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.780
 the light goes out 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:48.080
 and well this has been the whole tutorial 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.629
 he gave them a simple one 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.460
 and easy to do because I imagine that 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.639
 not many 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.039
 you will know this 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.210
 but good, the vast majority knows it but 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.490
 low 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.849
 it's good 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.099
 this is my first reston tutorial 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.440
 I hope you liked it already you know like 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.830
 favorites and convert would be great 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.780
 help and good to subscribe if you want 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.200
 keep watching videos of this type 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.889
 I upload a daily video but we think that 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.480
 today I will upload all if I am going to upload two 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.450
 but this one 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.480
 if I'm going to upload a daily video and good 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.110
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.110
 see you later
