 those for any occupation of women's areas

 and see what gives this teacher 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.849
 who will come why because under 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.289
 lady style may be hiding like 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.599
 blue from defile professional 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.160
 party girls because just a girl 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.910
 working in the dance studio dance studio 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.829
 decides what's called me 30 either this 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.450
 there may be more lirids so that 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.610
 jazz classic 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.200
 pen is not included. we are so far away 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.420
 similar to the one in principle almost 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.980
 not directly related high 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.260
 heals and head ie it is already more 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.350
 some really jazz easy 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.300
 radish voice can also be it 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.589
 being elementary is just incredible 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.499
 quick slippery plastic for calls 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.059
 under the female style it can be everything 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.010
 pampering anything let's 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.870
 and try to be more 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.749
 savvy watch the video of course but 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.690
 honestly be difficult to understand 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:04.360
 you will be allowed if you do not know and do not 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.280
 spin in this area and shone on video 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.380
 exactly what they say if they arise 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.790
 any questions send links to 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.590
 write comments 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.070
 can be on my site and you will be 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.610
 discuss 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.049
 Soon the site will not start the block and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.969
 will likely run the wire on the forum 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.950
 just with you we can discuss it all 3 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.320
 all we have to lock studio come in 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.030
 dance studio open it off 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.720
 look for the direction of the dance that you 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.460
 interested come to us and teacher 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.840
 carefully want to return is engaged 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.320
 account for the third engaged 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.970
 Of course, the important part is 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.930
 teacher rubber and new teacher resumes 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.270
 like her warmth I worked on from 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.490
 the involved fee is here and here is busy 38 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.560
 first places why it is not so important 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.470
 surely it matters surely it 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 parts of a tall man who gives about 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.500
 Gives you years gives you, that is, if 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.550
 constantly participate guys 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 festival competitions 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.980
 you boil in the industry certainly 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 how do you know yes they are all with us who 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.210
 studied at school can write correctly 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.119
 Grams Ladies School Finished New 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.610
 Russian language is not strong yes let here 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.010
 same thing we are participating festivals but 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.690
 not the fact that you even understand what 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.130
 going on with darkness may be your 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.200
 line can participate in festivals 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.970
 You can sample the clubs and do when 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.130
 actually 1 is also valid for the whole life and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.560
 you can develop the opposite too 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.610
 of course the board embarrassment week is involved 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.230
 and be so focused on 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 self-realization on self-study that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.580
 walk old glass come on in 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.810
 to rise 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 ride overseas this similar 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.930
 master class too unfortunately so 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 topic when writing a huge new list 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.650
 master class first to you with these on nothing 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 they don't say you are human 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.970
 consumer is a man who does not know 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 wants to learn doesn't know how and what 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 so he wants to learn wants to come 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.610
 and understand what I read of course raisins I 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.160
 I go there migelle figel toni and then this 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.140
 like 30 thousand names and you don't understand 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.480
 who is your own drum 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.920
 climb sadly resume often not 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.190
 have a kind of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.340
 really informative parts for 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.260
 newbies 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.900
 that's why you need 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.760
 come to class come to 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.879
 classes start to do very 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.159
 important important important important part this then 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.220
 how the teacher responds to you of course 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.140
 surely many teachers can be tired 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.340
 bad mood in all people more and more 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.959
 anything can be but if this is mine 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.209
 a look perfect if you 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.549
 come to class 1 time and with you 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.290
 elementary greet you can even 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.409
 call name ideally you should know 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.930
 your name party yourself on contact should 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.760
 be interesting to you before work because 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.230
 what does he do for you if the teacher 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.159
 do for themselves it is not some sort 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.180
 if we take the option as if 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.000
 master class 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.709
 let's say of you in the hall 50 people 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.690
 naturally, God forbid , sees you for the first time 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.909
 just say hello and you all came to 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.319
 such a specific event here 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.530
 of course no one should be with you 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.659
 can meet but not too if this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.639
 lesson and the more it is not a new group 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.290
 if this is a new group, these pains are a widow 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.269
 we can introduce our tell about 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.190
 yourself a little bit and if not even 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.769
 tell me about yourself at least 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.329
 meet ask someone like a factory 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.910
 to go on contact in order 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.300
 so that you understand so that the block 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.160
 sent to work with you further analysis 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.310
 movements very often it happens that 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.680
 gives you a connection and a huge bunch you don't 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.529
 understand what is happening, look so 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.509
 here are fish eyes and 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.849
 and think that you are nevertheless finished 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.219
 just stupid the most terrible and the cantor 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.349
 nothing will work for you 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.149
 be for two reasons first you come in 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.509
 group which is initially much it 

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:48.069
 not your mind and second educator just in 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.519
 principle spit it means to work 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.019
 time he thinks he is a god of genius and 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:56.739
 he just gives you are required to absorb 

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:58.779
 it's like mother's milk with joy is 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:00.519
 another topic sure that this not be 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.289
 should in any case if 

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:03.759
 unprofessional and institution if you are not 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.099
 is a student of some kind 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.019
 dance 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.669
 universities of the national academy you should 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:10.929
 explain everything will explain 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.669
 and show the group should be 

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:14.769
 aimed at coming 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.509
 pupils unfortunately because of this very 

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:18.339
 it often happens that a group is not 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:21.239
 section that is constantly coming 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:25.119
 novices and people who are relatively 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:27.069
 working poorly on themselves and which 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.809
 miss class for this game put 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.999
 on the spot the teacher just scores on 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:33.099
 development group as a whole and do 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.529
 always understandably different 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.209
 dancing but with this hive not growing to 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.519
 Sorry for that very very often 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.769
 There are studios here, of course 

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:43.689
 understand and is it really a teacher 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.320
 this may not raise me 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.360
 do not know how to do it 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.370
 either it's just really a property 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.130
 studio or really very often 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.020
 changing you then need to talk about 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.970
 to create made some other 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.640
 a hand that will grow 20 times for 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.360
 wishing well let's say if houses goes 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.100
 just one letter 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.810
 unless of course gog several groups 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.620
 try it maybe you should 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.360
 change before the bullet no one else 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.280
 cancels work on himself in his case 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.810
 do you go dancing and do 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.950
 online you need to work on yourself 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.450
 and with bundles that give you in class 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.770
 anyway all these movements you 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.150
 can use later life 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.160
 if your job is to learn to dance 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.930
 clubs somewhere on holidays just to 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.210
 beautiful move on the image is stylish 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.880
 attention of course better to be more 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.190
 simple classes that are directed 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.040
 it is to study the volume of different 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.780
 movements than on the situation so if 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.550
 do you clean up more complicated and take u 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.280
 you from the installation of some kind of dancing 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.080
 bundles yes anyway you can this 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.420
 use don't say it's bad or 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.000
 okay, it's all okay, everything you need 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.280
 everything works well but here it is necessary 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.690
 understand and need to be able to isolate and 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.400
 remembers not everybody to run 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.600
 able to make really difficult 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.520
 who does this talk as they need 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.800
 getting used to this part of you should be 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.900
 so plus learn you go for more 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.460
 try hard every 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.850
 take movement as separate 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.350
 movement and as part of the elements here 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.450
 Of course, you still need to work with your head 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.240
 need to work on yourself and a little bit 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.970
 a little strain such itself became 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.940
 more or less clear what is what 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.780
 high heals 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.820
 It will become incomprehensible as a teacher 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.700
 how to understand what is your any 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.350
 case of course everything is purely individual 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.830
 one must try one must strive and 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.570
 try 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.450
 I hope you will succeed 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.310
 you helped my information if you 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.010
 I like to put likes like them 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.710
 about dinner than sharing with friends 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.720
 telling friends let's live together 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.560
 I love, thank you for your attention 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.130
 big-big sometime in not blackflies 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.130
