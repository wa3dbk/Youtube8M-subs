 jesus de polanco this postgraduate account 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.730
 among his teachers with outstanding 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.060
 figures of law the sciences 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.010
 policies and philosophy for us 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.410
 It has been a real pleasure to have 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.410
 enjoyed giving class forming and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.180
 investigating with these students that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.610
 some of them are very prominent 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.040
 teachers in their respective countries or 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.739
 they are working in institutions of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 guarantee or are newly licensed the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.340
 program aims to contribute to the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.469
 creation of an academic space of 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.750
 research on reforms 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.820
 Legal governance for the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.460
 human rights and duties in the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.559
 globalized society I think it is 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.780
 essential that kind of this type of course 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.640
 because they come to unite two aspects very 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.020
 important on the one hand as the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.610
 government functions is to say the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.710
 lines that they must adopt 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.260
 although they are still to direct the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.140
 society in all aspects and for 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.700
 another part that this should be done in 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 relationship with respect for rights 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.900
 basic of people the masters that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.420
 has a year that is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.040
 formed by 60 credits and not only has 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.100
 consider the theoretical and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.020
 face-to-face attendance are 27 students who have 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.120
 graduated after performing the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.790
 practices in institutions with which 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.500
 we have agreed and of great height between 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.020
 they the constitutional court every 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.540
 day is more important than not only 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 students of a law school or 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.470
 graduates in law to the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.540
 doctors are the teachers study it 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.850
 but to come to the knowledge of all 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.860
 citizens is something fundamental that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 know that the effectiveness of rights 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.770
 it's real that it's going to happen because if 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 no no state of this title is a 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.729
 link more than the chain that links the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.280
 university with the editorial group that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.950
 in his day jesÃºs de polanco is a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.989
 basically based strategic relationship 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.850
 in two masters one is the master of the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.190
 college journalism school

 autonomic of madrid the country and others the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.250
 master's 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.410
 skill and human rights some 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.400
 relationships that already have more than one 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 quarter of a century
