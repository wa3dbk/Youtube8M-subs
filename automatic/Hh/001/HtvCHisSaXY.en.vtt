 It seems that you are a talented girl 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:45.400
 apart from being beautiful and I think that 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.890
 it would be worth investing time in 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.780
 develop that voice give you more technique 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 give you more weight because I think you have 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.829
 talent for this and I think I would look 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.900
 very well on a stage with a little more 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.260

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.359
 no, but it's not a no, do not do this 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.689
