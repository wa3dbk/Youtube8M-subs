I think at Maplewood this you can see it
is<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.309> concert<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.570> tennis<00:00:40.140> eyes

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.780 
is a concert and then the tennis eyes
comes<00:00:40.830> in<00:00:41.040> sort<00:00:41.580> of<00:00:41.640> multicolored<00:00:42.710> effect

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
comes in sort of multicolored effect

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.090 

but<00:01:36.370> of<00:01:37.180> course<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.870> could<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:38.260> plug<00:01:38.950> into

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
but of course you could then plug into

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.670 
but of course you could then plug into
something<00:01:39.430> like<00:01:39.550> this<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.960> iRig<00:01:41.380> I've

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
something like this the the iRig I've

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.980 
something like this the the iRig I've
got<00:01:41.890> this<00:01:42.040> plugged<00:01:42.580> into<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.909> iPhone<00:01:43.060> or<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
plugs in the bottom there and it's

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.090 
plugs in the bottom there and it's
passive<00:01:51.700> as<00:01:51.790> well<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.119> no<00:01:52.270> batteries<00:01:53.100> all

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
passive as well so no batteries all

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.140 
passive as well so no batteries all
right<00:01:54.310> now<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:55.300> plugs<00:01:55.630> into<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:57.220> iRig<00:01:57.610> that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
right now that plugs into the iRig that

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.820 
right now that plugs into the iRig that
will<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.450> plug<00:01:58.659> into<00:01:58.840> your<00:01:58.960> iPhone<00:01:59.350> or<00:01:59.500> iPad

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
who make my rig actually have their own

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.860 
who make my rig actually have their own
app<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.390> well<00:02:10.950> or<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.519> course<00:02:12.790> being<00:02:13.360> electric

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
app as well or of course being electric

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.890 
app as well or of course being electric
you<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.830> plug<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> into<00:02:15.250> an<00:02:15.400> amplifier<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.600> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
you can plug it into an amplifier so a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.100 
you can plug it into an amplifier so a
little<00:02:17.500> tiny<00:02:18.390> 9-volt<00:02:19.390> battery<00:02:19.870> powered

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
little tiny 9-volt battery powered

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.910 
little tiny 9-volt battery powered
amplifier<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.340> does<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> job<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.920> switch

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
amplifier here does the job and switch

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.530 
amplifier here does the job and switch
that<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.540> way<00:02:25.660> we<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:27.510> turn<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
that on and the way we go turn the

the<00:03:31.079> only<00:03:31.230> negative<00:03:31.769> thing<00:03:31.829> I've<00:03:32.069> really<00:03:32.370> got

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
the only negative thing I've really got

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.699 
the only negative thing I've really got
is<00:03:32.879> this<00:03:33.030> horrible<00:03:33.690> logo<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.410> middle<00:03:34.440> I

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
is this horrible logo in the middle I

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.360 
is this horrible logo in the middle I
think<00:03:34.920> that's<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.190> bit<00:03:35.340> unnecessary

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
think that's a bit unnecessary

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.990 
think that's a bit unnecessary
that's<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.579> Griesa<00:03:38.910> but<00:03:40.459> possibly<00:03:41.459> say<00:03:41.790> that

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that's so Griesa but possibly say that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.240 
that's so Griesa but possibly say that
to<00:03:42.120> me<00:03:42.239> doesn't<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:44.010> has<00:03:44.220> a

strap as well so you could use that as
the<00:04:11.730> strip<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.680> that's<00:04:13.859> pretty<00:04:14.069> smart<00:04:17.389> as<00:04:18.389> I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the strip so that's pretty smart as I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.740

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
say one solid piece of good doubles as a

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.430 
say one solid piece of good doubles as a
cricket<00:04:22.289> bat

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440

there<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.530> your<00:04:25.740> guitar<00:04:26.490> pick<00:04:26.729> up<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.539> the

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
there is your guitar pick up the the

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.920 
there is your guitar pick up the the
bridge<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.870> stainless<00:04:30.870> steel<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.860> tuners<00:04:32.930> so

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
bridge is stainless steel the tuners so

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.469 
bridge is stainless steel the tuners so
the<00:04:34.410> strings<00:04:34.680> come<00:04:34.950> down<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> come<00:04:35.610> back<00:04:35.639> onto

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
the strings come down and come back onto

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.140 
the strings come down and come back onto
the<00:04:36.810> tuners<00:04:37.260> these<00:04:37.830> are<00:04:38.039> actually<00:04:38.310> geared<00:04:38.610> so

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
the tuners these are actually geared so

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.180 
the tuners these are actually geared so
therefore<00:04:39.720> someone<00:04:40.139> gear<00:04:40.440> tuners<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:40.950> they're

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
therefore someone gear tuners so they're

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.140 
therefore someone gear tuners so they're
not<00:04:41.599> pernickety<00:04:42.599> as<00:04:43.139> pitch<00:04:43.950> pipe<00:04:44.520> tuners

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
not pernickety as pitch pipe tuners

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.650 
not pernickety as pitch pipe tuners
might<00:04:45.330> be<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.700> other<00:04:47.820> thing<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.120> say<00:04:48.150> is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
might be the the other thing to say is

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.950 
might be the the other thing to say is
when<00:04:49.349> you're<00:04:49.530> playing<00:04:50.389> if<00:04:51.389> you're<00:04:51.690> playing

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
when you're playing if you're playing

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.300 
when you're playing if you're playing
something<00:04:52.139> like<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.320> D<00:04:52.530> chord<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:53.010> can<00:04:53.039> now

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
something like a D chord you can now

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.300 
something like a D chord you can now
move<00:04:53.760> around<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.870> top<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:55.289> head<00:04:55.470> so

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
move around to the top of the head so

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.120 
move around to the top of the head so
you<00:04:56.430> can<00:04:56.840> play<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> D<00:04:58.110> chord<00:04:58.410> over<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.680> top<00:04:58.889> like

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
you can play a D chord over the top like

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.680 
you can play a D chord over the top like
that

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.310 
that
so<00:05:01.010> ya<00:05:02.010> got<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> constraint<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.320> working

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
so ya got the constraint of working

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.790 
so ya got the constraint of working
around<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.740> head<00:05:05.210> as<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.270> play<00:05:06.690> gets<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.620> bit

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
around the head as you play gets a bit

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.920 
around the head as you play gets a bit
