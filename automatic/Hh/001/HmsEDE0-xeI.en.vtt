00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.100
 eat and instead of getting fat lose weight 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.830
 an old dream that food with 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.530
 Negative calories could make 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.199
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.260
 in our previous video I sang to you that 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.560
 they are what they are and how they work 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.660
 the foods with negative calories with 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.180
 what we are going to happen directly to give 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.810
 the list of foods that in your balance 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.840
 metabolic throw a negative balance 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.470
 in the vegetable group we would have the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.270
 following foods the celery that contributes 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:50.910
 17 calories per 100 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:58.650
 the pumpkin with 33 cauliflower 27 asparagus 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:04.390
 17 calories broccoli 32 onion 38 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:11.020
 in Libya 20 spinach 26 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 lettuce 13 cucumber 16 and carrot 42 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 calories for every 100 grams 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.220
 as you see foods that oscillate between 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.160
 the 16 calories of the cucumber until 42 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 of the carrot that for every 100 grams 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.380
 what comes between 0 16 and 0.42 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.310
 calories grams amount less than 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.130
 needed to be metabolized 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.630
 in the chapter of the routes is a bit 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 more complicated because of the issue of 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.280
 fructose however given the composition 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.860
 and type of fiber of some of them 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 the caloric result could also be 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 negative we mean the oranges the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.299
 watermelon 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.330
 the pomegranate the grapefruit or grapefruit and the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.800
 prunes variety claudia 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.510
 this in terms of vegetables and fruits in the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.820
 moment we leave the fruits and 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.160
 vegetables is further reduced the number of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.020
 food with those characteristics if 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.090
 well there are some 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.400
 among them would be white fish 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 boiled cinnamon fresh cheese 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 muesli wholegrain cereals without 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.400
 sugar and egg white 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.110
 They are not many but if enough 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
 like to cheat the stomach 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.040
 when you are hungry 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.439
 However, it must be clarified that when 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.689
 any of these foods 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.360
 accompanied by bread sauces or any 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.420
 another food with a positive balance of 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.069
 calories its effect will not be noticed since 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.709
 once the machinery is put into operation 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.180
 digestive this will take advantage of the synergies 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.769
 of digestion therefore to be able 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.310
 take advantage of the negative effect of 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:05.310
 these foods should be taken alone 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.560
 or combined among them 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.420
 if you did not see our previous video in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.180
 the one that we explained what is the process 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 metabolism of negative calories 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.280
 we leave the link at the end of this video 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.800
 so you can see 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.980
 I hope this work can be 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.240
 useful and I encourage you to subscribe here 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.240
