00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
can kind of get that but the plastic

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.080 
can kind of get that but the plastic
sometimes<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.259> melt<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.429> do<00:02:04.580> that<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.000> in

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
sometimes we melt all so do that and in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.999 
sometimes we melt all so do that and in
14<00:02:05.509> days<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.320> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.560> start<00:02:06.770> seeing

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
14 days you are going to start seeing

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.370 
14 days you are going to start seeing
seedlings<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:08.330> soon<00:02:08.569> as<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.810> see<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.170> savings

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
seedlings as soon as you see the savings

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.460 
seedlings as soon as you see the savings
take<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.190> cover<00:02:10.550> off<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.150> now<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
take the cover off and now it's going to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.370 
take the cover off and now it's going to
need<00:02:12.650> light<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:14.330> keep<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.720> fairly<00:02:15.080> moist

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
need light and to keep it fairly moist

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.740 
need light and to keep it fairly moist
depending<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.190> what<00:02:16.459> what<00:02:17.180> you're<00:02:17.330> growing

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
depending on what what you're growing

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.940 
depending on what what you're growing
you<00:02:18.080> want<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.350> read<00:02:18.470> those<00:02:18.650> growing

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
you want to read those growing

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.370 
you want to read those growing
instructions<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.420> sometimes<00:02:20.840> I'll<00:02:21.049> get<00:02:21.200> one

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
instructions and sometimes I'll get one

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.180 
instructions and sometimes I'll get one
that's<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.120> huge<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.230> take<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
that's that is huge so I take it out and

that's that is huge so I take it out and
then<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.580> keep<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.940> cover<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:26.959> help

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
then I keep the cover on so on my help

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.880 
then I keep the cover on so on my help
ceiling<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.739> well<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> good<00:02:29.420> start<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
ceiling as well get a good start so

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.110 
ceiling as well get a good start so
we're<00:02:30.890> gonna<00:02:31.010> put<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.220> away<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.849> that's

we're gonna put that away and that's
going<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.390> get<00:02:32.450> heated<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.830> they

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
going to get heated up now as they

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.699 
going to get heated up now as they
emerge<00:02:34.900> you're<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.049> to<00:02:36.110> come<00:02:36.319> out<00:02:36.349> with

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
emerge you're going to come out with

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.150 
emerge you're going to come out with
something<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:39.260> will<00:02:39.890> look<00:02:39.980> out

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
something like this this will look out

something like this this will look out
of<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:40.489> I've<00:02:40.760> got<00:02:40.790> some<00:02:41.209> things<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.569> need<00:02:41.599> to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
of here I've got some things I need to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020 
of here I've got some things I need to
work<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.160> one<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.549> beefsteak

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
work on but this is one of my beefsteak

work on but this is one of my beefsteak
tomatoes<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.290> we're<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.590> do<00:02:45.739> is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
tomatoes so what we're going to do is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440 
tomatoes so what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.160> take<00:02:46.310> off<00:02:46.489> those<00:02:46.730> first<00:02:47.090> few

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
we're going to take off those first few

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.349 
we're going to take off those first few
leaves<00:02:47.720> okay<00:02:48.349> these<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.580> not<00:02:49.790> considered

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
leaves okay these are not considered

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.319 
leaves okay these are not considered
true<00:02:50.690> leaves<00:02:51.489> they're<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.640> first<00:02:52.850> ones<00:02:53.030> that

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
true leaves they're the first ones that

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.430 
true leaves they're the first ones that
you<00:02:53.480> see<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.350> i<00:02:55.130> believe<00:02:56.049> they<00:02:57.049> send

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
you see and i believe they send

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.880 
you see and i believe they send
nutrients<00:02:58.100> tone<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.959> take<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.620> real

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
nutrients tone don't take that is real

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.650 
nutrients tone don't take that is real
but<00:03:01.010> i<00:03:01.100> think<00:03:01.310> that's<00:03:01.519> what<00:03:01.940> gives<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.450> plant

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
but i think that's what gives the plant

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.930 
but i think that's what gives the plant
the<00:03:02.810> nutrients<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.530> then<00:03:04.519> when<00:03:04.700> you're<00:03:04.819> going

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
the nutrients and then when you're going

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.680 
the nutrients and then when you're going
to<00:03:05.030> repot<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.540> our<00:03:06.190> planet<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:08.090> need<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.540> give

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
to repot it our planet you need to give

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.080 
to repot it our planet you need to give
it<00:03:08.720> some<00:03:09.019> different<00:03:09.500> soil<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.459> starting<00:03:10.970> in

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
it some different soil it's starting in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.210 
it some different soil it's starting in
a<00:03:11.120> seed<00:03:11.480> mixing<00:03:11.989> soil<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.790> what<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.660> use<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.530> just

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
a seed mixing soil and what I use I just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.420 
a seed mixing soil and what I use I just
use<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.989> miracle-gro<00:03:17.989> or<00:03:18.500> whatever<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.310> an

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
use like miracle-gro or whatever is an

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.449 
use like miracle-gro or whatever is an
organic<00:03:19.760> soil<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:21.319> basically<00:03:21.980> I'm<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.160> going

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459

the<00:04:06.129> bottom<00:04:06.609> okay<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.579> going<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.790> go<00:04:09.969> on<00:04:09.999> a

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the bottom okay so it's going to go on a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.720 
the bottom okay so it's going to go on a
flat<00:04:10.510> surface<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:11.319> then<00:04:11.560> every<00:04:12.040> day<00:04:12.189> twice<00:04:12.669> a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
flat surface and then every day twice a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.959 
flat surface and then every day twice a
day<00:04:13.409> I'm<00:04:14.409> going<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.709> water<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.400> bottom<00:04:15.730> so

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:15.969 
day I'm going to water the bottom so

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.349 
day I'm going to water the bottom so
then<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.769> roots<00:04:18.009> are<00:04:18.220> going<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.489> pull<00:04:19.090> a

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
then the the roots are going to pull a

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.180 
then the the roots are going to pull a
lot<00:04:19.599> of<00:04:19.720> times<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.229> you're<00:04:20.380> watering<00:04:20.769> from<00:04:20.979> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
lot of times if you're watering from the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.629 
lot of times if you're watering from the
top<00:04:21.690> what<00:04:22.690> happens<00:04:23.199> is<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.470> gets<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:23.949> moist<00:04:24.340> it

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
top what happens is it gets so moist it

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.430 
top what happens is it gets so moist it
gets<00:04:24.880> very<00:04:25.000> weak<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.870> then<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.229> going<00:04:26.380> to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
gets very weak and then it's going to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.279 
gets very weak and then it's going to
snap<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.759> I've<00:04:28.000> learned<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.720> did<00:04:29.139> thank

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
snap so I've learned that I did thank

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.870 
snap so I've learned that I did thank
you<00:04:29.410> covers<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.009> I'm<00:04:30.190> like<00:04:30.340> why<00:04:30.610> are<00:04:30.669> these

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
you covers that I'm like why are these

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.029 
you covers that I'm like why are these
all<00:04:31.030> snapping<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:32.139> that's<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.740> good<00:04:32.889> way<00:04:33.009> to

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
all snapping so that's a good way to

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.730 
all snapping so that's a good way to
water<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.639> from<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.120> bottom<00:04:34.479> or<00:04:35.349> if<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.530> have

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
water is from the bottom or if you have

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.129 
water is from the bottom or if you have
a<00:04:35.800> bin<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:37.060> can<00:04:37.240> stick<00:04:37.509> them<00:04:37.630> on<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:38.050> and

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
a bin you can stick them on there and

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.390 
a bin you can stick them on there and
just<00:04:38.229> water<00:04:38.590> from<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.039> bin<00:04:39.479> so<00:04:40.479> um<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:42.039> hope

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
just water from the bin so um I hope

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.490 
just water from the bin so um I hope
