00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
played the Kings Indian attack you think

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.869 
played the Kings Indian attack you think
he'd<00:00:03.179> go<00:00:03.270> for<00:00:03.330> something<00:00:03.629> more<00:00:03.899> ah<00:00:04.879> well

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
he'd go for something more ah well

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.610 
he'd go for something more ah well
actually<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.540> was<00:00:06.810> what<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> expected<00:00:07.560> more

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
actually that was what I expected more

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.480 
actually that was what I expected more
or<00:00:07.890> less<00:00:08.010> but<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.639> know<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.929> think<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.309> too

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
or less but you know I think I was too

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.270 
or less but you know I think I was too
well<00:00:11.759> prepared<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.360> more<00:00:13.290> without<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.799> big

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
well prepared and more without a big

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.700 
well prepared and more without a big
problem<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.080> comfortable

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
problem I got a very comfortable

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250 
problem I got a very comfortable
position<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> maybe<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:18.260> nothing

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
position but it maybe it was nothing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.929 
position but it maybe it was nothing
more<00:00:19.439> than<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.369> looked<00:00:20.609> nice

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
more than that you know it looked nice

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.929 
more than that you know it looked nice
but<00:00:21.410> probably<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.949> normal<00:00:23.640> game

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
but probably it was just a normal game

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
but probably it was just a normal game
maybe<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.420> too<00:00:24.600> spectacular<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
maybe not too spectacular but I see it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.519 
maybe not too spectacular but I see it
was<00:00:25.980> quite<00:00:26.849> fighting<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.840> holding<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> draw

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
was quite fighting by holding the draw

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.169 
was quite fighting by holding the draw
you<00:00:28.859> stay<00:00:29.099> within<00:00:29.310> striking<00:00:29.609> distance<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
you stay within striking distance of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.429 
you stay within striking distance of
second<00:00:30.539> place<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
second place was that one of the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.450 
second place was that one of the
thoughts<00:00:31.590> he<00:00:31.769> had<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.070> into<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> game

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
thoughts he had going into the game

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.479 
thoughts he had going into the game
today<00:00:32.669> oh<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:33.920> again<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> don't<00:00:35.130> have

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
today oh no actually again I don't have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.540 
today oh no actually again I don't have
these<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.530> problems<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.309> about

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
these kind of problems of think about

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 
these kind of problems of think about
the<00:00:38.670> result<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> play<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the result I just go to play for you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560 
the result I just go to play for you
know<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> play<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:42.030> depends<00:00:42.360> also

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
know just to play and it depends also

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
know just to play and it depends also
especially<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.860> black<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.489> really

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
especially when you're black if really

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
especially when you're black if really
they're<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.200> opponent's<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.890> strong

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
they're all your opponent's is so strong

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
they're all your opponent's is so strong
so<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.489> didn't<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> play<00:00:48.930> for

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so we didn't really want to play for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
so we didn't really want to play for
draw<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.800> manage<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.239> far<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.719> know

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
draw they can manage but so far you know

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.279 
draw they can manage but so far you know
everyone<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.620> fighting<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.870> again<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.079> was

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
everyone is fighting and again it was

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
everyone is fighting and again it was
just<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.710> normal<00:00:56.370> game<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:58.020> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just a normal game we I don't think we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
just a normal game we I don't think we
made<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.059> speak<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> her<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> don't

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
made it was not speak to her but I don't

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
made it was not speak to her but I don't
think<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.530> made<00:01:01.710> big<00:01:01.920> mistakes<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
think we made big mistakes into the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969 
think we made big mistakes into the
level<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.210> quite<00:01:03.420> high<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.379> only<00:01:04.530> had<00:01:04.710> three

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
level is quite high you only had three

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
level is quite high you only had three
drawers<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> nine<00:01:06.060> games<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.900> typical

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
drawers i think in nine games is typical

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
drawers i think in nine games is typical
for<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> doesn't

really happened of course i didn't want

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.460
