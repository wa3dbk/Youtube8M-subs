00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
forward so that he can use his optimum

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
forward so that he can use his optimum
speed<00:01:15.299> while<00:01:16.110> running<00:01:16.439> towards<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> ball

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

speed while running towards the ball
this<00:01:18.240> movement<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.590> effective<00:01:19.860> way

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
this movement is a really effective way

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.719 
this movement is a really effective way
to<00:01:20.340> outrun<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.689> defenders<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
to outrun all the defenders and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
to outrun all the defenders and
eventually<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.180> perform<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> cross<00:01:25.020> afterward

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
eventually to perform a cross afterward

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.429 
eventually to perform a cross afterward
the<00:01:26.220> second<00:01:26.670> variation<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.750> movement<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the second variation of this movement is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.890 
the second variation of this movement is
if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.950> flick<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.640> stick<00:01:29.939> once<00:01:30.210> right

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
if you flick the right stick once right

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
if you flick the right stick once right
here<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:31.439> prepared<00:01:31.950> two<00:01:32.220> types<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
here I've prepared two types of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.719 
here I've prepared two types of
performing<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.829> guess<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.340> well

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
performing the first one I guess is well

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.390 
performing the first one I guess is well
known<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.740> along<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
known to you you get to use it along the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
known to you you get to use it along the
wings<00:01:38.610> again<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> flick<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> right

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
wings again you have to flick the right

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
wings again you have to flick the right
stick<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.250> towards<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> free<00:01:42.509> space<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
stick one towards the free space the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
stick one towards the free space the
player<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:44.040> striker<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.880> ball<00:01:45.060> forward<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
player will striker the ball forward and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.649 
player will striker the ball forward and
he<00:01:46.110> will<00:01:46.290> start<00:01:46.649> running<00:01:46.979> using<00:01:47.640> his<00:01:48.000> maximum

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
he will start running using his maximum

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.950 
he will start running using his maximum
speed<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.070> case<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:50.970> also<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
speed in this case you will also have to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
speed in this case you will also have to
keep<00:01:52.200> holding<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.159> sprint<00:01:53.549> button<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.240> order

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
keep holding the sprint button in order

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
keep holding the sprint button in order
to<00:01:55.020> perform<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.649> move<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to perform the move as you can see the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.230 
to perform the move as you can see the
difference<00:01:57.899> between<00:01:58.439> both<00:01:58.649> combos<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.700> that
