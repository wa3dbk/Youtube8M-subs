00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.349
 hello everybody is now after room 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.140
 here we are again in our office 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.570
 today to talk about new support 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.360
 specifically we talk about the Galilean 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.050
 this support you see generation 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.300
 it is an electronic mechanism 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 remotely controllable from all 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.150
 ios systems so let's talk about iphone 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.360
 ipad 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.220
 some ipod models are possible 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.350
 use it both with 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.809
 I cover video cameras thanks to the adapter 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.730
 which must be purchased separately not 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.789
 it comes with Galilean but it is 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.770
 can also be used with iphone 5 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.090
 iphone iphone 6 ipod ipod 5 and also 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.440
 the iphone 5 c 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.030
 now let's go specifically like this 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.160
 we can better understand the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.350
 operation of the Galilean is that for 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.930
 which was then studied ingallinera 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.790
 initially it looks like this not 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 we can see 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.860
 we can first connect it to a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.299
 any photographic or equipped media 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.970
 of a thread from a birth of 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.940
 thumb like the classic window 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.009
 tripod standard in fact in this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.180
 In case we installed one of ours 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.729
 tripod and through the adapter I say 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 however what you see on this in operation is 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 possible to save the naked video camera 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.800
 so without the tin face and now 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.320
 I wanted to stop the Galilean like I do 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.630
 see better the assembly of the in 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.450
 support support which is very similar to 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.920
 the frame we say the product the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.080
 gopro you have the possibility of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.880
 operate the wifi device then the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.119
 camcorder sa recommendable at a distance 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.270
 via cover or via the smart 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.580
 remote of go pro and mounting is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.409
 very simple so we have a support 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.000
 flexible where we will fit together 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.179
 just the camera body of ours 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 video camera that we will then put on 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.290
 on the Galilean support 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.720
 in this way we will raise in galileo e 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.860
 we can command it directly from the dal 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.080
 our ipad 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.050
 then the free application for 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.330
 regarding the Galilean movement 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.459
 but are also available 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.220
 paid apps that allow 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.230
 to increase functions or Galilean 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.110
 therefore also remote commands via 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.130
 internet there are special functions 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.250
 for the creation of time laps also the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.160
 ability to recognize if mounted 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.780
 with apple devices to recognize 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.830
 your crisis and therefore to follow you 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.470
 during the recording 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 but now we talk about it specifically 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.109
 of use with our video cameras 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.570
 moprho so we have ours here 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.640
 application looks like this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.859
 at the first start we will be asked to move the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.780
 Galilean to connect it once 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.910
 connected we will have two available 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.380
 functions for checking the first one 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.239
 function we talk about a function 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.700
 joystick then a function totally 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.130
 manual then based on how we will move 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.549
 the joystick and our Galilean yes 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.290
 will move we have a 360 orientation 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.970
 degrees both on the horizontal axis does not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.920
 I'm doing that now on art 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.160
 on the vertical axis 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.840
 some of you who will use in 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.570
 future this support will also be able to 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.579
 have fun creating movements 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.950
 in short, we have to take a little hands 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.440
 but really the possibility of a 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.600
 full 360 degree movement 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.650
 both axes therefore in this way 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.310
 we will succeed in orienting ours 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.240
 remote camera via ours 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.700
 our ipad very interesting instead the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.500
 function of for the function of leaks 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.870
 born mainly for the classic for 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.500
 creating panoramic or day videos 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.710
 time laps what the inter - berthe a 31 does 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.830
 from three speeds and is therefore possible 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.930
 to give the Galilean a movement 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.820
 then adjust just for the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.030
 flexible gratification o 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.100
 panoramic logically we can send 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.870
 the orientation of the 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.110
 for him galliano both senses 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.150
 no one sends us on the other side like that 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.930
 by making a movement we will keep a lot 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.740
 this is also possible linear 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.810
 use it on both axes besides 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.780
 to have three modes we have a 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:41.200
 available a proper setting 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.030
 millimeter of Galilean perhaps for i 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.820
 longer time lapse so if you want 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
 perform a very long time lapse 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 we are going to lower the speed of the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.140
 Galilean so as to then get in 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.540
 post-production a more fluid video 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.910
 possible 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.380
 in short this is a support that 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.650
 certainly lovers will love it 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.850
 of the time laps but finds many 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.590
 applications as it gives this 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.700
 possibility to totally control it a 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.740
 distance 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.140
 logical that the camera being 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.080
 used without the kers was not 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.360
 therefore we recommend the maximum attention 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.970
 when using copro devices 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.800
 without using the kers it would be better 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.480
 first use a lens of 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.520
 protection because east you also find 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.900
 on a camera protection lens 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.260
 sorry that you also find on ours 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.640
 own catalog to avoid breakages 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.889
 in accidental falls from ours 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.289
 video camera the Galilean e 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.629
 is available on our website I remind you 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.819
 a little camera.it we are retailers 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.219
 Galilean officers and supply 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.699
 Italian warranty service for two 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.460
 years 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.270
 I remind you of our contacts found 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.189
 on the forum 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.870
 and on the site then the number of 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.389
 telephone with a schedule in which 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.610
 open switchboard and also the form for 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.830
 contacts therefore need to know 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.930
 request more information you can 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.699
 also write me an email I remind you 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.749
 also our technical forum which 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:10.009
 find at www.camera.it slash copro 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:13.569
 central dash slash forum greet you 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.569
 and see you at the next video
