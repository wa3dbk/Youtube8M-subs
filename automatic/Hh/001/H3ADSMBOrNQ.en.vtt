00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.350
 friends how are you I hope you are well 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.540
 and if they are not going to be happy because they 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.940
 You can find an application that they 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.450
 will allow making calls 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.099
 completely free to any 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.410
 telephone company I am Mexican live 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.390
 in Mexico obviously so he has 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.509
 worked perfectly for any 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.460
 telephone company of mexico and good 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.320
 let's see how it works first that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.749
 nothing we should know that the number of 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.130
 this application is bobsled and we can 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.920
 find completely free in the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.810
 appstore second this application for 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.280
 able to do it you need to use your 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.290
 facebook to connect or what 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.420
 otherwise register me and me 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.250
 register they gave me a number of 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.380
 activation that arrives to your mail 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.450
 electronic and later they can 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.040
 keep using it the second thing there 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.990
 what to know is that this application is not 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.270
 available for everyone only 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.700
 for some countries this side told him 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.780
 I leave a list of countries for 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.480
 which is available 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.000
 The advantage is that Mexico works 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.250
 perfectly as I had already told you and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.770
 now we are going to start seeing what 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.720
 does this application and how does the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.290
 number to be a tag in the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.820
 flag of the USA that is why he lives 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.230
 usually and selective of our 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.660
 country in this case I will select Mexico 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.810
 we are going to click on done and we 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.660
 will offer an initialization +52 for 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.900
 put the number we have to add the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:35.750
 which would be 55 in the area where I live 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 and then add the number this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.860
 in case the call is local 55 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.910
 plus the number 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.670
 very good now if the call we're going to 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.290
 to do is to a cell phone in this case 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 we have to add the 0 44 sorry 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.409
 correct here is 0 44 and the number 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 rain call a friend to try 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.310
 I hope you answer us we exist in your 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.149
 home but I want you to listen 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 very well 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.910
 044 I will put your number 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.870
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.880
 and use clicking apparently good code 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.340
 he had a small mistake because he tells me that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.280
 the microphone is not connected maybe it's 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 a normal error let him correct and I 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670
 he came back 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.300
 very good friends already corrects the error and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.970
 here we are back now I am going to 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.650
 select mexico again and I'm going to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.110
 put back the phone number of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.200
 my friend that I am going to call you so that 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.110
 see that this works 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.780
 very well let's click on code or on 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.580
 the green line and we will look like this 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 let's see the indicator to the number of the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.580
 that we are calling the time that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 we take a call a button to 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.510
 mute that is called newt other 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 press and spyker that is to upload 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.040
 automatically the strongest volume and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.150
 another to end the call we will see 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.950
 also that there says that we can 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.010
 connect our hearing aids for a 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.930
 better experience on the call and from that 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.700
 is how I have it, besides that 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.099
 I'm proposing a ipod touch 2g 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.140
 which is the version that already has a microphone 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.180
 so they can see that it works from the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.670
 older version up to the most 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.730
 new good I did not answer a friend I'm going 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.920
 to end the call, however, 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.510
 I can make the call that in my house 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.450
 because I'm doing this video and it 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.840
 too late and the phone if it rings because 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.849
 people are going to scare and apart right now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.730
 I have no mobile phone pÃ©rez 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.650
 cellular so 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.360
 so they do not say that I'm going to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.580
 leave like this without knowing that close 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.470
 because that's how it works, you should leave a link 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.540
 from a channel where I saw this application 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.840
 next with the computer now the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.430
 pledge very well I leave here the link to 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 channel where they will be able to see 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.920
 completely 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.629
 this this application working also 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.310
 so for us to help each other 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.140
 community that can give us visit the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.810
 videos but if this application 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.670
 this is what it does and well also if 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.310
 they want some tutor to envelope windows 8 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.380
 as you can see I already have windows 8 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.790
 Well, if you can not say in addition 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.699

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.180
