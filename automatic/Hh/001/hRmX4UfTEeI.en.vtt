 adventurous finds that in the part of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.699

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.520
 the new house of the new property

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.680
 another side of this fence lived the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.420
 people that he says he's wearing in his pajamas 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.119
 all day and it's funny because it's there 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.490
 where the well-known one is another of 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.799
 the protagonists of this story is a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.259
 child of his age who lives on the other side 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.659
 of the fence is very thin and pale and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.729
 the truth is that he does not even know what 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.380
 what is happening around him the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.940
 novel is based mainly on the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.340
 friendship that is born between these two 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.319
 characters and also in the desire to 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.569
 bruno to understand everything that is 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.640
 happening around him like for example 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.880
 what his father really does 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.830
 because it is very sad all the time 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.659
 who are these people who live on 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.729
 another side of the fence and they dress me 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.920
 day flame and many other things that 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.899
 he approaches his mind and he can not understand 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.429
 from all at a very early age they 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.220
 they discover that in life you have to take 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.840
 decisions and that people and very in 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.450
 particular the adults 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.490
 different ideas of what is right and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.619
 it is curious the contrast that presents itself 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.379
 in the book even in the same title 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.599
 between a world that lives in black lines 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.459
 and the innocence of a child who does not 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.440
 understands words of blood and that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.780
 he only wants to help his friend but 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.599
 I am very touched by the nature of 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.420
 human being before being corrupted in his 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.340
 initial state in its purest state 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.739
 in these two children who did not know about 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 races or social status wars 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.390
 world but they only believed in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.190
 friendship, loyalty and forgiveness is a 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.410
 novel that although it is aimed at a 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.959
 children and young people can be 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.310
 enjoy and read for all ages in 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.370
 2008 say cinematographic adaptation 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.260
 directed by Marc germÃ¡n and himself 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.019
 john boyne as a screenwriter and what 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.819
 Personal I loved this book 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.920
 talk about one of the most 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.379
 dark of the history of mankind and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.390
 I feel it is very important not to forget 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.849
 you expect it like this, they make you see the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.190
 inside of the people the nobility and the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.730
 I hate and all you can feel the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.860
 heart 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.260
 and what I can do the truth 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.640
