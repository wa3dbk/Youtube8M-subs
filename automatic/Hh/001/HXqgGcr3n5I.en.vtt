00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.160
 so welcome to another 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.019
 from me today no comments already 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 today what brand new video game myths 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.700
 as I said in advance 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.100
 and as you can see it's about pokémon it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
 Today is about 2 video games 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.869
 first, the tomi mythos and the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.080
 second missing you 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.019
 Let's start something with the toni 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 the first pokémon editions were 151 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.610
 pokémon wow what a 151 only 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.350
 Now we think I have no idea 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.719
 46 pieces no idea 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 so that's about the 232 number and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 million 151 in pocket 6s means that the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 a failed clown attempt 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 is from mio and that's with him 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.969
 the depot of this klum try so me 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.039
 do not know but this myth will 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 still believed that really ditto 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 this failure of this experiment is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.159
 but he is passed on, and me 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.110
 do not know so the question is yes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670
 whether this is true with what we become 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.090
 see 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 So let's go with the little ones 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 button the gates ditto is possible all 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 learn to attack by only his 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.860
 attacke converter he uses himself in 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.530
 transform any pokemon like you 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.110
 already said the apa and it is because 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.360
 that a genetic misconstruction 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.540
 so has this error from this 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.600
 clown he called because a complete 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.200
 I own dns dns from every pokemon 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.360
 Do not know 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 I'll go straight to the menu 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.790
 it is not possible either 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.619
 but not to learn attacks 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 because of transducers because, for example, when 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.439
 one of these days you can probably no 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 others can learn new from behind 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.310
 learn everything what it wants 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 there is really as I said all dns 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.659
 There are traces of pokémon but there are 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.759
 even more similarities the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.239
 unbelievable if they realized that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:17.310
 both agreed that they are pink yes it is 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:22.800
 similar funny actually what can you do 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:26.569
 still say that a blue mio knows what 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.890
 that of course the chemistry form 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.200
 mio is there because of light blue 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.720
 of course that the tour here too 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.450
 nice picture between ditto and mio 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.420
 like both such a similar one 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 actually look very good so well 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.290
 the blue is actually good though 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.410
 another ten meters 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.800
 then yes as you can see now mean 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.519
 I weigh both side by side okay then both 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.569
 four kilos okay but a difference 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.690
 is there between the two nexus s is the 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.080
 size both are only 100 centimeters 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.940
 away from each other is the bigger and 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 it looks smaller than 100 pages again 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.280
 but the question is actually 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.470
 whether this dns zeugs tried one 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.069
 bust was or so but that the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.459
 myth 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.989
 that's what i know they 're alike 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.650
 similar but not so similar i know 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.140
 it not 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.610
 You know, write me the comment 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.260
 I would always answer your questions 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.810
 be happy again 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.140
 Well that was the first myth like us 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.180
 Go to missing missing you will be fine 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.129
 everyone from the old games know where 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.980
 one must only meet very often could 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.790
 because it's always playing in the previous ones 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.110
 there were many programming errors 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.580
 Now we are the 2012 where it is 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.830
 The technology shines and shines 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.549
 okay not quite yes we start with 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.810
 to the name 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.340
 missing only ok someone has times 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.980
 I wonder why a little bit more 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.780
 yes, everyone has 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.299
 Who can google it clearly in the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.890
 Advantage not sowas wine knowledge only 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.000
 consists of two parts 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.019
 missing and no the missing stands for 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.220
 English from misery so not available 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.009
 missing what I know 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.290
 if you occupy that because only point 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.699
 is synonymous point you see well or 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.500
 woe to program knows and must now 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.460
 has seen times only know know 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.440
 that one point connection 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.430
 that's the abbreviation for number so 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.220
 English and German number means 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:46.320
 missing only missing the number 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.850
 why that was so there was 151 pokemon like 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.810
 already said above at a first 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.490
 said and jannis ingo was easy 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.169
 not programmed and that was then 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.169
 a programming error because missing yet 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:03.800
 no pokédex number has kicked where the 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:07.370
 brass as 152 or missing number 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.530
 because it's not just that 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.080
 monster number i call you but 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.560
 now with ingo was then at the beginning 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.300
 very spectacular because it is very big 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.060
 but then it did not even have advantages 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.020
 so express negative consequences had for 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.930
 the pokémon play 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.650
 the advantage of missio was that the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.680
 vitamin bag at the sixth place 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.330
 129 times the negative thing was that 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.009
 the foyer was broken or 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.900
 no idea why 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.020
 and it too graphic and memory errors 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.610
 What most players do to the new 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.729
 started bringing this game and 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.639
 they did not want to meet anymore 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:52.680
 so said but well 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.319
 that's what this myth says now 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.910
 unfortunately died because of the games 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.250
 were just improved to now 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.390
 example, you see black and white 2 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.310
 or black and white 1 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.160
 I do not know what comes next 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.300
 I'm not such a pokémon sugar then 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.230
 I would have to ask someone else but 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.640
 earlier in the other games was 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.770
 just a bit reachable now 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.160
 unfortunately not right anymore but only 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:22.970
 even with ten modules with modules yes with 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.250
 exactly one module was only valid 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.710
 but I would simply say you are 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.450
 very moderate only optimally encountered 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.700
 actually had to catch because of 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.720
 have only ever start over 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.740
 she writes in the comments I am 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.570
 always pleased 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:42.680
 Well, I was so happy for you 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:46.820
 to bring a little new from me so 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.620
 I hope you liked something new 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.430
 to hear from me not only comments 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.970
 about games and youtuber now times 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.120
 video games myths 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.570
 I'll do more of these things 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.340
 because I have no myths yet 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.560
 very unknown are even too 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.740
 well known as for example i have to stop 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.120
 only yes probably knows everyone knows but 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.010
 if you like German 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.560
 subscribing or subscribing is always possible 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.940
 and comment on what you want as 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.480
 next for a video game huts 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:20.780
 hear or have you ever heard of myths 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.000
 encountered similar and sent me 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.060
 just once something and I know with 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.750
 personally like to analyze 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.010
 So I hope I have this with me 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.770
 video helped a bit further though 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.580
 invade the video game hero and me 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.360
 Hope to see you at the next video 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.360
 comment and now video games
