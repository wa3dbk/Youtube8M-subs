00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.640 

all<00:00:01.709> right<00:00:01.949> here<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.129> go<00:00:02.220> it's<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.820> plug-in

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
all right here we go it's a plug-in

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.169 
all right here we go it's a plug-in
after<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> couple<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.100> wood<00:00:05.870> modifications

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
after a couple of wood modifications

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.600 
after a couple of wood modifications
we're<00:00:09.179> gonna<00:00:09.330> see<00:00:09.599> if<00:00:09.719> it'll<00:00:10.550> primary<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
we're gonna see if it'll primary the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.870 
we're gonna see if it'll primary the
output<00:00:14.610> like<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> fx5<00:00:15.900> does<00:00:16.580> motor<00:00:17.580> still

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
output like the fx5 does motor still

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:38.370 
output like the fx5 does motor still
might<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.480> loud

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.660 

okay<00:00:39.380> so<00:00:39.470> it<00:00:39.710> looks<00:00:39.890> like<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.190> hole<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.550> I've

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
okay so it looks like the hole that I've

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.750 
okay so it looks like the hole that I've
drilled<00:00:40.970> in<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.240> side<00:00:41.450> of<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.630> bulkhead

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
drilled in the side of the bulkhead

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840 
drilled in the side of the bulkhead
output<00:00:43.760> bulkhead<00:00:44.890> did<00:00:45.890> exactly<00:00:46.400> what<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.580> said

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
output bulkhead did exactly what I said

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.590 
output bulkhead did exactly what I said
here<00:00:47.239> what<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.960> mean<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.200> guess<00:00:48.380> it's<00:00:49.600> pretty

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
here what I mean I guess it's pretty

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.750 
here what I mean I guess it's pretty
obvious<00:00:51.110> being<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.650> fx5<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.520> same

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
obvious being that the fx5 is the same

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.280 
obvious being that the fx5 is the same
way<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:54.790> all<00:00:55.790> right<00:00:56.120> let's<00:00:56.390> see<00:00:56.840> if<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:57.080> can

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
way so all right let's see if we can

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.570 
way so all right let's see if we can
fire<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.160> back

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:25.090 

yes

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.990 

Motors<00:01:25.820> not<00:01:26.000> terribly<00:01:26.450> loud<00:01:27.790> it's<00:01:28.790> better

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
Motors not terribly loud it's better

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.590 
Motors not terribly loud it's better
than<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.210> was<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:31.210> think<00:01:32.210> if<00:01:32.300> he<00:01:32.330> had<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
than it was but I think if he had a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.850 
than it was but I think if he had a
brand<00:01:32.960> new<00:01:33.310> or<00:01:34.310> at<00:01:34.520> least<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.930> non<00:01:35.930> hybrid

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.540 

motor<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.130> there

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
motor in there

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.190 
motor in there
cher<00:01:41.360> would<00:01:41.510> turn<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:42.310> quiet<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:44.690> now<00:01:44.870> all<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
cher would turn out quiet so now all I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.290 
cher would turn out quiet so now all I
have<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.470> do<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.680> just<00:01:45.850> looks<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:46.910> there's<00:01:47.240> a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
have to do is just looks like there's a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.760 
have to do is just looks like there's a
little<00:01:47.480> weed<00:01:48.880> right<00:01:49.880> there<00:01:50.300> I'm<00:01:51.230> not<00:01:51.410> sure<00:01:51.650> if

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
little weed right there I'm not sure if

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.360 
little weed right there I'm not sure if
that's<00:01:51.920> from<00:01:53.620> let's<00:01:54.620> try<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:54.980> didn't<00:01:55.130> use<00:01:55.250> any

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
that's from let's try you didn't use any

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.710 
that's from let's try you didn't use any
jump<00:01:55.640> line<00:01:55.790> tape<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.150> that's<00:01:56.270> probably<00:01:56.510> what

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
jump line tape so that's probably what

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.130 
jump line tape so that's probably what
it<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
it is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.160 
it is
set<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.860> having<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.520> not<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> big<00:01:59.000> deal<00:01:59.180> but<00:01:59.990> then

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
set in having so not a big deal but then

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.500 
set in having so not a big deal but then
right<00:02:00.320> here<00:02:00.650> that's<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.520> slip<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.479> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
right here that's just a slip this is a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.430 
right here that's just a slip this is a
threaded<00:02:02.810> Vulcan<00:02:03.290> I'm<00:02:03.820> on<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.000> top<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.570> then

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
threaded Vulcan I'm on the top and then

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.639 
threaded Vulcan I'm on the top and then
slip<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> bottom

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
slip on the bottom

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.740 
slip on the bottom
on<00:02:08.860> both<00:02:09.009> sides

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.620 

and<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.250> little<00:02:13.250> copper<00:02:13.670> at<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.450> mean

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and that's little copper at that I mean

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.690 
and that's little copper at that I mean
you<00:02:14.840> gotta<00:02:14.990> wiggle<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.530> out<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.330> being

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
you gotta wiggle that out but it's being

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.160 
you gotta wiggle that out but it's being
said<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.730> mean<00:02:19.760> that's<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.210> intake<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.990> it's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
said I mean that's the intake so it's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.850 
said I mean that's the intake so it's
not<00:02:21.320> even<00:02:21.500> gonna

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
not even gonna

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.310 
not even gonna
so<00:02:23.810> alrighty<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.950> it
