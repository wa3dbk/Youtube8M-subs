00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.080
 It is entirely your choice as 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.060
 the thousands of decisions that each 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 let's start with something delicious 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.740
 imagine that you can choose between two 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.230
 ice cream shops one only offers three 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.990
 flavors 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.270
 chocolate vanilla or strawberry 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.260
 the other has many to which they would go 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.650
 they probably said that the one that has 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.470
 more options well let's do that now 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.809
 decide what flavor they want they can choose 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.970
 between chocolate cookies with mint 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.830
 candy cookies and double cream 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.220
 chocolate nut butter 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:47.870
 pistachios vanilla cake rum with raisins 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.870
 and coffee well make your decision now 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.649
 They are happy with the choice that 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.350
 they took or is a bit hard to guess 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.260
 what the brain would have been happier 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.300
 with only three options and the reason has 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.400
 what to do with the surprising interaction 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.580
 of two different systems in the brain 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.950
 the doctor of jan hein of the school of 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.409
 yale management is here to help 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.119
 discover how we make decisions could 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.100
 say that the brain uses two 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.100
 systems to make decisions the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.020
 System 1 is automatic and unconscious 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.789
 is what made them jump to a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.280
 quick conclusion in the game the 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.740
 orange kangaroo system 2 is more 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.570
 deliberative and controlled system 2 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.490
 is the one that one relates to the taking of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.429
 decisions and that's what they used in the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 test it was easy for them to take the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.479
 first decision and enter the store 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 with more ice cream flavors but they had 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.600
 difficulties later to choose between 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.530
 so many options 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.179
 they probably chose the second 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.149
 store because they thought that the higher 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.969
 variety more happiness but that was his 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.520
 error more options open the door of the 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.649
 repentance and as humans we treat 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.829
 to avoid pain as much as we look 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.350
 pleasure then when there is more and more 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.270
 options to make a decision like 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.429
 the flavors of ice cream or thousands of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.349
 TV shows the brain does not 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.599
 just try to think about what it is that 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.430
 one wants also tries to escape from 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.549
 the feeling that one is lost 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.739
 something better then one wants to choose 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.790
 cookie ice cream and repent for not 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.980
 choose candy or any of the others 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.079
 psychologists call this the paradox 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 of choice and is what makes one 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.130
 be paralyzed unable to take a 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.630
 decision and it's one of the ways that the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.670
 decision making can be more 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.670
 complicated of what one could imagine
