and I'm going to tie a rubber band
around<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.649> while<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.429> sits<00:02:08.789> while<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> color

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
around it while it sits while the color

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.110 
around it while it sits while the color
sits<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:10.739> hour<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.819> guess

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
this is how it happened so I'm going to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.200 
this is how it happened so I'm going to
wait<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.599> let<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:22.960> sit<00:04:23.229> for<00:04:23.260> an<00:04:23.740> hour<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.760> we

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
wait and let this sit for an hour and we

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.719 
wait and let this sit for an hour and we
gonna<00:04:25.389> see<00:04:25.510> what<00:04:25.630> happens<00:04:25.889> so<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.490> what

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
gonna see what happens so this is what

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:36.330 
gonna see what happens so this is what
it's<00:04:27.910> looking<00:04:28.419> like<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:29.110> far<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:36.039> just

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
it's looking like so far and I'm just

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.980 
it's looking like so far and I'm just
hoping<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:37.120> looks<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.599> way<00:04:37.780> when<00:04:37.960> I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
hoping that it looks this way when I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.790 
hoping that it looks this way when I
rinse<00:04:38.349> it<00:04:38.530> out<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.740> kind<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:40.139> like<00:04:41.139> once<00:04:41.650> it

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
rinse it out and kind of like once it

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.210 
rinse it out and kind of like once it
out<00:04:41.919> with<00:04:42.070> water<00:04:42.360> hopefully<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:44.200> is<00:04:44.680> what<00:04:45.099> it

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
out with water hopefully this is what it

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.790 
out with water hopefully this is what it
looks<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:47.139> guess<00:04:47.380> we'll<00:04:47.620> have<00:04:47.740> to

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
looks like but I guess we'll have to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.140 
looks like but I guess we'll have to
wait<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.220> see<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:49.289> didn't<00:04:50.289> get<00:04:50.410> around<00:04:50.650> to
