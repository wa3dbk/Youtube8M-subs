00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.969 

all<00:01:04.339> right<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:04.879> game<00:01:05.149> is<00:01:05.479> not<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.350> total

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
all right this game is not a total

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.380 
all right this game is not a total
disaster<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.960> good<00:01:10.119> it<00:01:11.119> does

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
disaster but it's not that good it does

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.740 
disaster but it's not that good it does
have<00:01:11.600> its<00:01:11.750> quirky<00:01:12.560> moments<00:01:12.950> though<00:01:13.149> and<00:01:14.149> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
have its quirky moments though and it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.710 
have its quirky moments though and it
can<00:01:14.960> be<00:01:15.110> somewhat<00:01:15.710> enjoyable<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.280> play<00:01:16.720> but

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
can be somewhat enjoyable to play but

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.930 
can be somewhat enjoyable to play but
it's<00:01:17.869> rather<00:01:18.350> repetitive<00:01:18.830> even<00:01:19.460> by<00:01:19.610> Atari

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
it's rather repetitive even by Atari

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.719 
it's rather repetitive even by Atari
standards<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.619> general<00:01:22.039> premise<00:01:22.310> of

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
standards so the general premise of

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.330 
standards so the general premise of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
shoot a rapid-fire purse of laser beams

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.520 
shoot a rapid-fire purse of laser beams
but<00:03:15.770> they'll<00:03:15.920> only<00:03:15.950> travel<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.730> short<00:03:16.760> distance

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
but they'll only travel a short distance

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.600 
but they'll only travel a short distance
so<00:03:18.530> there's<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.800> tiny<00:03:19.070> bit<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.370> strategy

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
so there's a tiny bit of strategy

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.320 
so there's a tiny bit of strategy
involved<00:03:20.270> here<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:20.990> not<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.170> whole<00:03:21.380> lot<00:03:22.090> now<00:03:23.090> as

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
involved here but not a whole lot now as

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.630 
involved here but not a whole lot now as
I<00:03:23.480> said<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.900> game<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.140> repetitive<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.250> it

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
I said this game is repetitive and it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.000 
I said this game is repetitive and it
will<00:03:25.940> certainly<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:27.800> me

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
will certainly for the out of me

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.310 
will certainly for the out of me
when<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.640> play<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.150> more<00:03:29.330> than<00:03:29.510> five

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
when you play it for more than five

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.270 
when you play it for more than five
minutes<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:32.570> that's<00:03:33.080> due<00:03:33.320> mostly<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
minutes and that's due mostly to the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.560 
minutes and that's due mostly to the
lack<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.560> interesting<00:03:36.560> environments<00:03:37.190> or

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
lack of interesting environments or

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.300 
lack of interesting environments or
changing<00:03:38.570> environments<00:03:39.140> really<00:03:40.100> there's

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
changing environments really there's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.610 
changing environments really there's
just<00:03:40.370> some<00:03:40.670> random<00:03:41.140> blocks<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.440> there<00:03:42.560> are

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
just some random blocks and there are

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.650 
just some random blocks and there are
obstacles<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.460> that's<00:03:43.640> about<00:03:43.850> them<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.420> they

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
obstacles and that's about them and they

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.700 
obstacles and that's about them and they
stroll<00:03:45.080> by<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:47.390> enough<00:03:48.230> about<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.560> bad

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
stroll by you but enough about the bad

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.650 
stroll by you but enough about the bad
points<00:03:49.160> there<00:03:49.280> are<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.460> few<00:03:49.760> nice<00:03:50.030> points<00:03:50.510> in

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
points there are a few nice points in

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.990 
points there are a few nice points in
this<00:03:50.750> game<00:03:50.920> for<00:03:51.920> one<00:03:52.160> there's<00:03:52.460> little<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.970> no

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
this game for one there's little to no

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.480 
this game for one there's little to no
flicker<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.080> character<00:03:54.620> sprites<00:03:54.740> there's

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
flicker on the character sprites there's

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.970 
flicker on the character sprites there's
a<00:03:55.520> nice<00:03:55.700> nice<00:03:56.300> thing<00:03:56.570> for<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:57.470> all<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.770> khari

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
a nice nice thing for it all the khari

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.310 
a nice nice thing for it all the khari
game<00:03:58.190> like<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.810> usually<00:03:59.810> when<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.200> had<00:04:00.290> a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
game like this usually when you had a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.100 
game like this usually when you had a
lot<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.620> different<00:04:01.310> color<00:04:01.540> moving<00:04:02.540> objects<00:04:03.020> on

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
lot of different color moving objects on

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.360 
lot of different color moving objects on
the<00:04:03.200> screen<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.560> need<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.740> whole<00:04:04.070> ton<00:04:04.340> of

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
the screen you need a whole ton of

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.370 
the screen you need a whole ton of
flicker<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.090> it's<00:04:05.540> hard<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:06.020> what

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
flicker and it's hard to see what

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.490 
flicker and it's hard to see what
exactly<00:04:06.830> is<00:04:07.190> what<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:09.050> other<00:04:09.200> thing<00:04:09.410> I

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
exactly is what the other thing I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.620 
exactly is what the other thing I
thought<00:04:09.680> was<00:04:09.830> neat<00:04:10.070> was<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.910> animation

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
thought was neat was a the animation

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.930 
thought was neat was a the animation
that<00:04:11.930> happens<00:04:12.709> when<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:13.010> die<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.280> that's<00:04:13.790> you

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
that happens when you die and that's you

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.670 
that happens when you die and that's you
kind<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.180> disintegrate<00:04:14.840> which<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.470> thought

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
kind of disintegrate which I thought

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.070 
kind of disintegrate which I thought
looked<00:04:15.860> pretty<00:04:16.070> nice<00:04:16.250> for<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.030> Atari<00:04:17.299> 2600<00:04:17.840> of

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
looked pretty nice for the Atari 2600 of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.110 
looked pretty nice for the Atari 2600 of
anyway<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:19.190> game<00:04:19.340> like<00:04:19.520> this<00:04:19.669> might<00:04:19.940> be

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
anyway the game like this might be

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.020 
anyway the game like this might be
actually<00:04:20.750> beneficial<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.970> introducing<00:04:22.970> a

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
actually beneficial to introducing a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.360 
actually beneficial to introducing a
small<00:04:23.060> child<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.750> video<00:04:24.020> games<00:04:24.290> because<00:04:25.130> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
small child to video games because the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.070 
small child to video games because the
controls<00:04:25.700> are<00:04:25.820> quite<00:04:25.940> simple<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.510> responsive

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
controls are quite simple and responsive

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
controls are quite simple and responsive
and<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.410> concept<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.130> easy<00:04:28.280> enough<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.790> grass

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
