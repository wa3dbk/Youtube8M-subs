00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
to bring it over here this would give

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.290 
to bring it over here this would give

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
i'm assuming the story is gonna be the

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.519 
i'm assuming the story is gonna be the
most<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.599> second<00:04:45.930> characters<00:04:46.319> are<00:04:46.409> gonna

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529 
most of the second characters are gonna

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.809 
most of the second characters are gonna
be<00:04:46.680> mostly<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.249> different<00:04:47.699> it's

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
be mostly this a different it's

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.939 
be mostly this a different it's
different<00:04:48.210> because<00:04:48.569> is<00:04:48.749> gonna<00:04:48.900> look<00:04:49.080> at<00:04:49.289> right

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
different because is gonna look at right

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.679 
different because is gonna look at right
it<00:04:50.189> is<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.699> interesting<00:04:51.090> if<00:04:51.240> they<00:04:51.419> could

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
it is really interesting if they could

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.839 
it is really interesting if they could
and<00:04:52.319> who<00:04:52.590> knows<00:04:52.710> if<00:04:52.770> they<00:04:53.009> will<00:04:53.039> they<00:04:53.699> can

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
and who knows if they will they can

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.309 
and who knows if they will they can
introduce<00:04:54.090> something<00:04:54.330> where<00:04:54.539> no<00:04:54.960> cuz<00:04:55.139> it's<00:04:55.259> a

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
introduce something where no cuz it's a

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.140 
introduce something where no cuz it's a
nintendo<00:04:55.710> system<00:04:55.889> so<00:04:56.159> if<00:04:56.430> they're<00:04:56.669> confident

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
nintendo system so if they're confident

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.209 
nintendo system so if they're confident
saying<00:04:57.389> this<00:04:57.719> is<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.900> come<00:04:58.139> out<00:04:58.259> on<00:04:58.469> the<00:04:58.499> MX<00:04:58.949> and

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
saying this is a come out on the MX and

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.309 
saying this is a come out on the MX and
i<00:04:59.639> still<00:05:00.120> think<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.599> NX<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.050> gonna<00:05:01.139> come

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
i still think the NX is not gonna come

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.929 
i still think the NX is not gonna come
out<00:05:01.439> to<00:05:01.529> 2017<00:05:03.710> because<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.919> hasn't<00:05:05.129> been<00:05:05.340> shown

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:05.939 
out to 2017 because it hasn't been shown

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.119 
out to 2017 because it hasn't been shown
yet<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.990> wii<00:05:07.139> u<00:05:07.349> didn't<00:05:07.889> come<00:05:07.979> out<00:05:08.069> until

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
yet and the wii u didn't come out until

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.790 
yet and the wii u didn't come out until
a<00:05:08.400> year<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.789> a<00:05:08.819> half<00:05:08.849> after<00:05:09.150> was<00:05:09.419> shown<00:05:09.629> at<00:05:10.259> e3

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
a year and a half after was shown at e3

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.929 
a year and a half after was shown at e3
2011<00:05:11.900> originally<00:05:13.159> so<00:05:14.159> I<00:05:14.189> guessed<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.669> in<00:05:14.789> 10

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
2011 originally so I guessed it in 10

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.269 
2011 originally so I guessed it in 10

the<00:05:18.029> annex<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.479> definitely<00:05:18.990> going<00:05:19.139> to<00:05:19.199> be<00:05:19.259> out

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
the annex is definitely going to be out

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.850 
the annex is definitely going to be out
late<00:05:20.210> 2016<00:05:21.210> or<00:05:21.360> early<00:05:21.569> two<00:05:21.750> thousand<00:05:22.139> like<00:05:22.439> I'm

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
late 2016 or early two thousand like I'm

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860 
late 2016 or early two thousand like I'm
very<00:05:23.430> curious<00:05:23.669> about<00:05:23.969> or<00:05:24.330> are<00:05:24.539> they<00:05:24.839> just

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
very curious about or are they just

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.079 
very curious about or are they just
assuming<00:05:25.469> like<00:05:25.589> everyone<00:05:25.889> else<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.099> it's

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
assuming like everyone else that it's

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.820 
assuming like everyone else that it's
going<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.360> come<00:05:27.509> out<00:05:27.569> first<00:05:27.900> on<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.349> 3ds<00:05:28.680> and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
going to come out first on the 3ds and

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.619 
going to come out first on the 3ds and
ps4<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.430> then<00:05:29.610> maybe<00:05:29.849> later<00:05:30.089> in<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.449> year

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
ps4 and then maybe later in the year

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.570 
ps4 and then maybe later in the year
it'll<00:05:30.900> come<00:05:31.139> out<00:05:31.289> on<00:05:31.529> you<00:05:31.740> know<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:32.400> new

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
it'll come out on you know this new

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.189 
it'll come out on you know this new

we<00:05:34.379> want<00:05:34.560> this<00:05:34.680> new<00:05:34.830> system<00:05:35.039> come<00:05:35.279> out<00:05:35.400> because

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
we want this new system come out because

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.249 
we want this new system come out because
n<00:05:35.610> we<00:05:35.699> can<00:05:35.819> port<00:05:36.029> the<00:05:36.120> ps4<00:05:36.419> version<00:05:36.960> over<00:05:37.169> to

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
n we can port the ps4 version over to

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.659 
n we can port the ps4 version over to
the<00:05:37.349> NX<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.949> know<00:05:38.039> or<00:05:38.129> something<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.639> that

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
the NX you know or something of that

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.240 
the NX you know or something of that
nature<00:05:38.819> I'm<00:05:39.330> not<00:05:39.569> certain<00:05:39.839> because<00:05:40.250> well

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
nature I'm not certain because well

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.920 
nature I'm not certain because well
that's<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.520> very<00:05:41.699> weird<00:05:41.909> thing<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.210> say<00:05:42.300> we're

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
that's a very weird thing to say we're

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.170 
that's a very weird thing to say we're
gonna<00:05:43.020> all<00:05:43.319> plan<00:05:43.889> this<00:05:43.919> for<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.339> system<00:05:44.729> that<00:05:44.879> no

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
gonna all plan this for a system that no

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.990 
gonna all plan this for a system that no
one<00:05:45.330> knows<00:05:45.509> anything<00:05:45.629> about<00:05:45.990> sure<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.830> but<00:05:47.759> I

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
one knows anything about sure I but I

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.550 
one knows anything about sure I but I
would<00:05:48.389> take<00:05:48.569> this<00:05:48.719> in<00:05:48.899> mind<00:05:49.020> Dragon<00:05:49.529> Quest

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
would take this in mind Dragon Quest

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.379 
would take this in mind Dragon Quest
games<00:05:49.889> from<00:05:50.279> announcement<00:05:50.909> to<00:05:51.089> release

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
games from announcement to release

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.679 
games from announcement to release
usually<00:05:51.960> take<00:05:52.169> quite<00:05:52.379> some<00:05:52.620> time<00:05:53.509> let's<00:05:54.509> say

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
usually take quite some time let's say

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.260 
usually take quite some time let's say
two<00:05:54.750> years<00:05:55.169> okay<00:05:55.860> that's<00:05:56.250> two<00:05:56.669> years<00:05:56.849> before

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
two years okay that's two years before

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.600 
two years okay that's two years before
the<00:05:57.360> MX<00:05:57.659> comes<00:05:57.960> out<00:05:58.139> that's<00:05:58.649> actually<00:05:58.919> kind<00:05:59.520> of

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
the MX comes out that's actually kind of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.850 
the MX comes out that's actually kind of
right<00:05:59.789> where<00:05:59.969> you<00:06:00.089> and<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:00.300> think<00:06:00.599> it<00:06:00.779> would<00:06:01.649> be

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
right where you and I think it would be

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.619 
right where you and I think it would be
you<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.669> I<00:06:02.729> are<00:06:02.849> both<00:06:02.969> basically<00:06:03.419> on<00:06:03.479> the<00:06:03.539> same

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
you and I are both basically on the same

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.990 
you and I are both basically on the same
originally<00:06:04.560> you<00:06:04.649> so<00:06:04.800> maybe<00:06:04.949> in<00:06:05.159> the<00:06:05.189> 2016<00:06:05.849> I

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
originally you so maybe in the 2016 I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.209 
originally you so maybe in the 2016 I
definitely<00:06:06.270> step<00:06:06.509> 2070<00:06:07.289> I<00:06:07.379> said<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.649> said

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
definitely step 2070 I said I said

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.159 
definitely step 2070 I said I said
that's<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.789> earliest<00:06:09.060> thing<00:06:09.750> could<00:06:09.990> happen

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
that's the earliest thing could happen

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.570 
that's the earliest thing could happen
oh<00:06:10.409> yeah<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.680> have<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:10.949> yeah<00:06:11.279> it's<00:06:11.430> gonna

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
oh yeah you have like yeah it's gonna

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.459 
oh yeah you have like yeah it's gonna
happen<00:06:11.729> this<00:06:11.969> whatever<00:06:12.419> yeah<00:06:12.750> I<00:06:12.899> do<00:06:13.020> think

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
happen this whatever yeah I do think

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.639 
happen this whatever yeah I do think
it's<00:06:13.620> 2017<00:06:14.550> yeah<00:06:14.639> I<00:06:14.669> think<00:06:14.819> 2017<00:06:15.599> is<00:06:15.839> likely

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
it's 2017 yeah I think 2017 is likely

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:18.260 
it's 2017 yeah I think 2017 is likely
based<00:06:16.860> upon<00:06:17.099> the<00:06:17.430> life<00:06:17.639> cycles<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.120> these

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
based upon the life cycles of these

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.110 
based upon the life cycles of these
systems<00:06:18.419> that<00:06:18.719> we<00:06:18.810> see<00:06:18.960> I<00:06:19.110> also<00:06:19.379> think<00:06:19.740> I

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
systems that we see I also think I

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.279 
systems that we see I also think I
earlier<00:06:21.120> in<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.360> segment<00:06:21.569> I<00:06:21.779> started<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.169> say

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
earlier in the segment I started to say

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.230 
earlier in the segment I started to say
something<00:06:22.319> and<00:06:22.740> then<00:06:22.860> caught<00:06:23.310> myself<00:06:23.520> because

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
something and then caught myself because

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.240 
something and then caught myself because
I<00:06:24.389> realized<00:06:24.569> Nintendo<00:06:25.349> systems<00:06:25.770> and<00:06:25.949> so<00:06:26.099> many

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
I realized Nintendo systems and so many

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.779 
I realized Nintendo systems and so many
systems<00:06:26.610> won't<00:06:26.819> play<00:06:27.089> together<00:06:27.300> nicely<00:06:28.020> but

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
systems won't play together nicely but

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.249 
systems won't play together nicely but
it<00:06:29.789> would<00:06:29.969> be<00:06:30.000> interesting<00:06:30.089> if<00:06:30.599> you<00:06:30.719> could<00:06:31.110> get

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
it would be interesting if you could get

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.170 
it would be interesting if you could get
a<00:06:31.289> version<00:06:31.649> for<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:31.860> MX<00:06:32.279> with<00:06:32.699> all<00:06:32.909> of<00:06:33.000> its

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
a version for the MX with all of its

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.629 
a version for the MX with all of its
souped-up<00:06:33.659> graphics<00:06:34.259> and<00:06:34.500> have<00:06:35.159> your<00:06:35.279> 3ds

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
souped-up graphics and have your 3ds

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.029 
souped-up graphics and have your 3ds
version<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.419> share<00:06:36.779> your<00:06:36.870> save<00:06:37.199> file<00:06:37.560> between

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
version and share your save file between

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:38.530 
version and share your save file between
the<00:06:38.190> version

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
the version

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.990 
the version
which<00:06:39.350> would<00:06:39.980> mean<00:06:40.160> that<00:06:40.220> both<00:06:40.700> versions

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
which would mean that both versions

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.790 
which would mean that both versions
would<00:06:41.450> kind<00:06:41.780> of<00:06:41.900> have<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.170> launch<00:06:42.320> at<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.590> same

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
would kind of have to launch at the same

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.740 
would kind of have to launch at the same
time<00:06:43.010> before<00:06:43.250> we<00:06:43.340> make<00:06:43.520> sense<00:06:43.790> it<00:06:43.970> 3d<00:06:44.330> as<00:06:44.420> a

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
time before we make sense it 3d as a

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.110 
time before we make sense it 3d as a
controller<00:06:45.170> on<00:06:45.410> the<00:06:45.440> annex<00:06:45.890> yeah<00:06:46.700> which<00:06:46.940> some

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
controller on the annex yeah which some

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.280 
controller on the annex yeah which some
people<00:06:47.240> thought<00:06:47.540> when<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:47.870> wii<00:06:47.960> u<00:06:48.140> was

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
people thought when the wii u was

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.870 
people thought when the wii u was
announced<00:06:48.650> that<00:06:48.710> that<00:06:49.310> would<00:06:49.460> be<00:06:49.490> an<00:06:49.700> option
