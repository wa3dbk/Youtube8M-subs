 And 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.390
 Because it is monaural audio track here Dawn and new track 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.670

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 Let's use the plug-in effect included in dp 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 The guitar itself is raw but it's already 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.140
