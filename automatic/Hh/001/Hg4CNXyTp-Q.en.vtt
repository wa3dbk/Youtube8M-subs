00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 when in the Soviet Union blew fresh 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.730
 wind of change and restructuring entered 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
 such a crucial stage 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.929
 phase of the Soviet Union national team just 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.240
 won second place in the championship 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.570
 Europe and of course all the players were then 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.150
 hot cakes in western clubs but first 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 loud such contracts became precisely 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.760
 your contract in the summer of '88 for 5 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.800
 million dollars coy ever 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.279
 terrible money very x were you gone in 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 turin juventus 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 it was scary to leave at all 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.210
 but a new team, that is, respectively 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 the capitalist world that is a little bit 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.370
 it was a little bit scary not by 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.510
 imagine, I think that initially probably 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.610
 can be more vasilich or there 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.829
 sports committee but most likely the area 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 sports committee and accommodated Vasilich 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.910
 Lobanovsky, that is, initially it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.949
 the last one should have seemed like 1 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 how to let go 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.510
 two at least in order to somehow 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.549
 would quickly adapt that is and 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.979
 maybe they no longer need us in juventus 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.320
 It was after two options in the same 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 barcelona barcelona was yes and juventus then 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 accordingly windows gave 5 gave 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 3 thousand where they said there and I go there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 I do not understand that there is something from 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.720
 this win some financial plan 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.090
 Of course the lower you were given changed for 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.650
 there is practically no financial 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 grew call from Kiev dynamo at all 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.049
 she was not there at all just came in 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.759
 the team that Juventus is with 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.890
 with ambitions that is accordingly wants 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.009
 play price win first places like 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.350
 once got to change generations directory not 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.909
 gone on let's not for there are almost four 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.869
 human world champions that is and got 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.970
 on the change of generations 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.190
 after but quite normally perform 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 third place was taken 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.880
 80 and 88 89 here I was a little bit 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.790
 complicated why because if 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.330
 analyze the whole year that is why 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 i will go like this end of December and practically 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.650
 failed six months why because 820 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.520
 young this training 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.670
 mean European cups then championship 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.890
 Europe then the championships of the USSR Zhizh that is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.900
 excellent drug world championships this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 peace yes that is but i played enough i don't know 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.860
 for 100r on and most likely that is because 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 of this i think it would be a failure 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.390
 which which I imagine first 1 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.700
 somehow uncomfortable feeling why 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.050
 because some journalists are there 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.630
 who worked in Italy that is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.850
 transmitted such information about 20 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 written by a weakling then we are somehow like that i 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.050
 somehow not convenient i.e. not uncomfortable 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.580
 I felt and somehow I really think 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.560
 forgot how to play football here in such 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.480
 the team was all pathetic of course this 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.220
 it was honorable i remember your last match 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.410
 from the rack and all the dynamo like you hand 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.750
 threw up a full stadium escort you 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.910
 pride certainly overwhelmed look 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.890
 but then took our and not somewhere in the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.770
 Juventus and instead of platini and want to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 he was a distributor of deposits but here 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.780
 you got there in the west 1 nobody 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.220
 makes coming to base and spend the night 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.320
 there for three days no one nothing 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.180
 says you felt lonely 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.459
 there was some kind but take so on the table I 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 there was a little bit of a canal to any place 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.250
 need to get used yes there is a month two three 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.780
 then you start to get involved 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.260
 produced accordingly already on 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.900
 the table has passed, that is already getting 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 why their man because once you 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.640
 it was a constraint that languages ​​are not 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.980
 do you speak with a translator 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.959
 want to tell something that is 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.910
 ok or even the president wants him 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.310
 tell you some such things that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 so that we only know between him between 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.970
 us that is, through pervachka can not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 more than 3 person should not listen to the case then 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.980
 there is either a good or a bad gin is 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.380
 hurt a little bit so I take 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.870
 character in his youth was such a guy 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.730
 shy accordingly me when 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.260
 yeah guys all after three and let's go 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.019
 the restaurant will have lunch there that is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.690
 get to know more because dima you 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.620
 know and meet people at the table village 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.830
 that is, in all countries, that is, I am 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.720
 so refused from the other side and 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.390
 now I did not refuse even a single penny 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:21.060
 they would not have spent on the purchase of products 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.800
 why would time be in a restaurant that is 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.630
 we had a normal setting on 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.030
 I just think that in the first year I don’t 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.970
 not much in her was not so much 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.130
 complex feeling well these players 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.600
 who performed in juventus received 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.370
 completely different money I think that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.260
 our officials warmed well then 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.150
 Savin holes sport was such an office 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 there was no second-rate feeling 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.210
 firstly 1 didn't know how much they get 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.949
 for example in the background say no one says 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.169
 One example of such as I knew that no 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.600
 probably a million times more than me getting 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.630
 why because i am not a secret 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.120
 how much have you got 1200 dollars i got in 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:02.430
 Juventus a month before then later 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.950
 when i passed i say so and so then 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.340
 there are no people say they are 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.110
 known in Juventas not know did not know to what 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.700
 have responsibly them ideas I went 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.080
 I'll show you a little bit 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.539
 understand i say because these things 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.760
 can't talk about translators 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.150
 accordingly juventus which is decent 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.220
 club 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.620
 that is, I would like to nick such 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.099
 clubs were everywhere that is especially with us 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.060
 yes there is no okay there is no question 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.530
 It means giving as it gets there. 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.479
 laudrup mikaella suddenly there or viola 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.330
 October was the world champion, we will not give 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.400
 you will not give well such a good average 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.020
 soundly what are you and what will you be 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.330
 ok feel we give you 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.120
 but this is only why you 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.550
 that there would still be something 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.470
 bring you to the consulate so that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.050
 in short 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.940
 invested overlaid fully goal well 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.070
 that is, I said that I came to 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.070
 cost accounting for those times
