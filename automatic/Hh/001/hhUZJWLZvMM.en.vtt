also this runs on the HTC Sense that's
3.5<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.509> total<00:01:48.899> storage<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> phone

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
3.5 and the total storage on the phone

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
3.5 and the total storage on the phone
is<00:01:49.920> 512<00:01:50.369> MB<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> available

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
is 512 MB and out of that available

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.999 
is 512 MB and out of that available
store<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.189> 90<00:01:53.579> MB<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
store it is just 90 MB but I think so it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.200 
store it is just 90 MB but I think so it
comes<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> 105<00:01:57.210> MB<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:58.040> available<00:01:59.040> space

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
comes down to 105 MB of available space

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
comes down to 105 MB of available space
but<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.780> microSD<00:02:01.439> slot<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.189> can

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
but we do have microSD slot so you can

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.240 
but we do have microSD slot so you can
expand<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> storage<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.659> by<00:02:04.469> default<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:05.070> get

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
expand the storage and by default we get

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.540 
expand the storage and by default we get
a<00:02:05.310> 2<00:02:05.579> GB<00:02:06.259> microSD<00:02:07.259> card<00:02:07.469> pre-installed<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
a 2 GB microSD card pre-installed on the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.110 
a 2 GB microSD card pre-installed on the
