 put eggplant in very thin slices there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.670
 I put on some olive oil and then I go 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.110
 screaming in the pan you need olive oil on the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.250
 ground and not in the pan because 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.820
 I have no idea why but it works 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.799
