on<00:00:26.849> hand<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.779> silver<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.949> look

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
on hand I think that silver would look

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.009 
on hand I think that silver would look
really<00:00:29.460> pretty<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> black<00:00:30.330> too<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
really pretty with the black too if you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
really pretty with the black too if you
like<00:00:31.140> change<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> gold<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
like change this from the gold and you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
like change this from the gold and you
do<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.570> silver<00:00:34.020> color<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.350> think<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
do like a silver color I think that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.979 
do like a silver color I think that
would<00:00:34.739> look<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:34.920> pretty<00:00:35.370> any<00:00:36.329> colors<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
would look really pretty any colors that

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.810 
would look really pretty any colors that
you<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.860> could<00:00:38.010> probably<00:00:38.250> do

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you want to use you could probably do

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010 
you want to use you could probably do
like<00:00:39.210> maybe<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> turquoise<00:00:41.450> glitter<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
like maybe like a turquoise glitter and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
like maybe like a turquoise glitter and
then<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.320> fade<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> black<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.730> like

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it works very very well and then a paper

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.530 
it works very very well and then a paper
towel<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.650> i<00:01:16.680> would<00:01:17.009> recommend<00:01:17.759> using<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

paper<00:01:18.720> towel<00:01:18.990> i<00:01:19.229> don't<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.680> tissue<00:01:19.890> would

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
paper towel i don't think a tissue would

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
paper towel i don't think a tissue would
work<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.119> doesn't<00:01:21.479> have

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
work as well because it doesn't have

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
work as well because it doesn't have
this<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:23.600> hard<00:01:24.860> indentations<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.220> this
