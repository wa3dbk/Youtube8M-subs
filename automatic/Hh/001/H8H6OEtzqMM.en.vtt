roughly an hour if you're using a

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.810 
roughly an hour if you're using a
pressure<00:06:08.850> cooker<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.860> would<00:06:10.860> say<00:06:11.220> an<00:06:11.490> hour<00:06:11.610> in

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
pressure cooker I would say an hour in

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.440 
pressure cooker I would say an hour in
half<00:06:12.060> if<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:12.780> use<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:12.930> normal<00:06:13.140> pot<00:06:13.530> in<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:15.180> end

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
half if you use a normal pot in the end

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.470 
half if you use a normal pot in the end
the<00:06:16.440> onions<00:06:16.860> should<00:06:17.220> melt<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.880> make<00:06:18.270> the

sauce<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.830> at<00:06:20.790> that<00:06:20.970> point<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.780> can<00:06:21.990> add<00:06:22.200> a

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
sauce and at that point you can add a

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.920 
sauce and at that point you can add a
little<00:06:22.530> bit<00:06:22.740> more<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.310> salt<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:24.060> pepper<00:06:24.540> if

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
hour and a half we'll lay it to the

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.350 
hour and a half we'll lay it to the
pressure<00:06:31.200> cooker<00:06:31.320> if<00:06:32.070> you<00:06:32.370> are<00:06:32.790> not<00:06:32.940> using<00:06:33.180> a

pressure cooker if you are not using a
pressure<00:06:33.540> cooker<00:06:33.720> but<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.590> normal<00:06:34.860> pot<00:06:35.160> maybe

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
pressure cooker but the normal pot maybe

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.560 
pressure cooker but the normal pot maybe
two<00:06:36.600> hours<00:06:37.110> in<00:06:37.350> sensible<00:06:37.800> time<00:06:38.040> and<00:06:38.390> we<00:06:39.390> let

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
two hours in sensible time and we let

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.510 
two hours in sensible time and we let
the<00:06:39.750> steam<00:06:39.990> out<00:06:40.320> and<00:06:40.710> now<00:06:41.070> we're<00:06:41.250> going<00:06:41.430> to

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
the steam out and now we're going to

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.229 
the steam out and now we're going to
open<00:06:41.670> it

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:49.239 

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:54.129 

okay<00:06:50.239> now<00:06:51.109> this<00:06:51.649> is<00:06:51.709> the<00:06:51.979> correct<00:06:52.339> texture<00:06:53.149> if

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
okay now this is the correct texture if

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.599 
okay now this is the correct texture if
yours<00:06:54.559> is<00:06:54.859> more<00:06:55.429> liquid<00:06:55.959> simply<00:06:57.459> simply<00:06:58.459> let

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:58.609 
yours is more liquid simply simply let

00:06:58.609 --> 00:07:00.699 
yours is more liquid simply simply let
it<00:06:58.639> cook<00:06:58.879> a<00:06:58.909> bit<00:06:59.269> little<00:06:59.659> bit<00:06:59.779> more<00:06:59.989> without

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:00.709 
it cook a bit little bit more without

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:05.589 
it cook a bit little bit more without
the<00:07:00.919> lid<00:07:01.389> so<00:07:02.389> that<00:07:02.539> it<00:07:02.659> dries<00:07:02.869> out<00:07:03.139> a<00:07:03.199> bit<00:07:04.599> too

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 
the lid so that it dries out a bit too

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.739 
the lid so that it dries out a bit too
early<00:07:05.679> if<00:07:06.679> you<00:07:06.739> want<00:07:06.859> to<00:07:07.069> use<00:07:07.219> it<00:07:07.429> as<00:07:07.699> a<00:07:07.759> pasta

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749
