00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.729
 good people of this world and not of 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.879
 others welcome once again to this 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:09.569
 step-by-step guide to art survival and 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.569
 final they give me something 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.139
 and welcome to my table of 200 where 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.570
 I will talk about creatures that have gone 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.670
 cultivating a small information 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.470
 review in them that they are giving us for 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.540
 let's go picking up the juice at 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.580
 game before this comes alone 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.890
 the child has just begun I will put 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.670
 a couple of dossiers for that flavor of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.040
 sabretooth mouth the scorpion but 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.050
 let's talk about him stegosaurus the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.030
 Dossiers are in English but I'll tell you 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.530
 I'm going to translate a small detail 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.600
 information that I forgot in the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.160
 first video is that the game when 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.409
 comes to consoles and that is when 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.220
 I arrived in the official and complete 2016 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.199
 will be in Spanish among other languages 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.199
 here they follow it here it is common that 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.900
 is easier to name the species 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.229
 is the time that is to say of the Jurassic the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.540
 herbivore diet and the temperament that is 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.879
 docile but eye on the data has 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.890
 approximately in pairs rows of 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.930
 plates along their backs between 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.820
 they open to each other this is what 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.380
 contrary to the fossils that there are in 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.950
 the museums this is written in such 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 way that the protagonist if he writes it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 not that here I've found a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.560
 stegosaurus in varying amounts in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.380
 almost every part of the island does not 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.899
 surprise the stegosaurus use the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.670
 spines of the tail to defend something 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.819
 logical if we face them 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.520
 let's avoid its tail if it is not aggressive 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.560
 a stegosaurus will come to his aid if 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.119
 this is close by which means that it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 help is to say that if you are going to attack a 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.780
 Stegosaurus hopes that it is isolated 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.210
 be alone because if you attack him in a group 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.119
 you will all come to finish the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.700
 text here puts that that implies that it be 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.740
 an animal ready and finally here it puts 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.049
 that when the domestic is a mount 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.849
 common is used as a safe way 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.939
 of transporting large quantities of 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.860
 goods the plates double the 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.989
 security is to say the coverage against 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.520
 the arrow of the attackers we go as a 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.310
 natural shield but they also do 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.259
 difficult loading and unloading things 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 great good I have to go in the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.620
 next video go through the channel 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.620
