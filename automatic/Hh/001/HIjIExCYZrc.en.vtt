00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so let's get started with this review

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
so let's get started with this review
and<00:00:59.430> take<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> look<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.120> how<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> cz<00:01:00.960> 3a1<00:01:01.379> fares

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and take a look at how the cz 3a1 fares

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
and take a look at how the cz 3a1 fares
up<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.399> being<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> personal<00:01:03.239> defense<00:01:03.390> weapon

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
up but being the personal defense weapon

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
up but being the personal defense weapon
for<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.680> engineers<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:06.390> enough<00:01:06.630> where

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
for all you engineers just enough where

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
for all you engineers just enough where
the<00:01:06.869> damage<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.290> weapon<00:01:07.650> comes<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.100> 25

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the damage this weapon comes in at 25

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.050 
the damage this weapon comes in at 25
dropping<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> 12<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.200> 12.1<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.490> specific

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
dropping up to 12 or 12.1 to be specific

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
dropping up to 12 or 12.1 to be specific
this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> pretty<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.380> average<00:01:13.530> stats

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this is pretty much the average stats

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.270 
this is pretty much the average stats
for<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> pdws<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.509> par<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> BB<00:01:16.380> mm<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
for the pdws some par with the BB mm and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
for the pdws some par with the BB mm and
the<00:01:17.340> UMP<00:01:17.790> 9<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.780> always<00:01:18.930> tends<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> be

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the UMP 9 but there always tends to be

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440 
the UMP 9 but there always tends to be
one<00:01:19.770> powerhouse<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> each<00:01:20.759> category<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
one powerhouse in each category that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
one powerhouse in each category that
kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> D<00:01:21.869> values<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> weapons<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
kind of D values through the weapons so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.100 
kind of D values through the weapons so
even<00:01:24.060> though<00:01:24.150> these<00:01:24.330> damaged<00:01:24.659> us<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> pretty

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
even though these damaged us a pretty

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.920 
even though these damaged us a pretty
competitively<00:01:25.890> gets<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> 3<00:01:26.460> out<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> 5<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
competitively gets a 3 out of 5 but this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.340 
competitively gets a 3 out of 5 but this
all<00:01:28.080> equates<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.829> 4<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.520> 9<00:01:29.820> shot<00:01:30.299> kill<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all equates to a 4 to 9 shot kill off so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230 
all equates to a 4 to 9 shot kill off so
that<00:01:31.380> 9<00:01:31.710> shot<00:01:32.040> kill<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.549> reinforces<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that 9 shot kill just reinforces that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.770 
that 9 shot kill just reinforces that
the<00:01:33.509> PDW<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> close-range<00:01:35.310> weapon<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the PDW is our a close-range weapon the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
the PDW is our a close-range weapon the
most<00:01:36.990> outstanding<00:01:37.320> step<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> Scorpion

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
most outstanding step for the Scorpion

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
most outstanding step for the Scorpion
Evo<00:01:39.240> 3<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.840> great<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> fire<00:01:40.439> fucking<00:01:40.979> in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
Evo 3 is it's great to fire fucking in

pdws and in my opinion this is what you

from<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> hip<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:55.649> four<00:01:55.920> shots<00:01:55.950> to

results in quite high recoil which is
definitely<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> case<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> C<00:02:03.270> Zed<00:02:03.509> 3<00:02:03.780> a1

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
the 1.9 second reload time it's um the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.910 
the 1.9 second reload time it's um the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
quicker end of the scale so keeping this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.590 
quicker end of the scale so keeping this
weapon<00:02:57.250> top<00:02:57.459> top<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.850> not<00:02:58.000> too<00:02:58.209> much<00:02:58.390> hassle

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
weapon top top is not too much hassle

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960

through<00:03:18.400> those<00:03:18.579> 30<00:03:18.850> rounds<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.510> one

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
through those 30 rounds in just one

be<00:03:23.829> nice<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.459> weapon<00:03:24.670> did<00:03:24.940> come<00:03:25.090> along

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209

with<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> 40<00:03:26.079> or<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.260> 50<00:03:26.620> round<00:03:26.799> Mike<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.430> you

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
with a 40 or a 50 round Mike just so you

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.160 
with a 40 or a 50 round Mike just so you
can<00:03:27.640> afford<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.120> take<00:03:28.540> out<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> couple<00:03:29.019> of

always<00:03:57.579> great<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.269> just<00:03:58.390> gets<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.690> point

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
always great but it just gets the point

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
where it starts to get a little bit

crazy 1000 rounds per minute it's just

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.930 
crazy 1000 rounds per minute it's just
on<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.890> verge<00:04:03.100> you've<00:04:03.400> been<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.640> little<00:04:03.820> bit

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
on the verge you've been a little bit

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
too much as it starts to become

detrimental to your ammo conservation

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.930 
detrimental to your ammo conservation
and<00:04:07.660> recoil<00:04:08.049> control<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.519> guess<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.790> main

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
and recoil control so I guess the main

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.090 
and recoil control so I guess the main
question<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:10.690> an<00:04:10.810> engineer<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.500> use<00:04:11.859> a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
question is as an engineer do you use a

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.240 
question is as an engineer do you use a
PDW<00:04:12.370> such<00:04:12.850> as<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.180> season<00:04:13.600> 3<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> 1<00:04:14.200> audio<00:04:14.620> opt

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
PDW such as the season 3 a 1 audio opt

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.670 
PDW such as the season 3 a 1 audio opt
for<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.609> carbine<00:04:16.120> such<00:04:16.419> as<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.720> new<00:04:16.930> mtar<00:04:17.470> which

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
for a carbine such as the new mtar which

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.469 
for a carbine such as the new mtar which
comes<00:04:17.950> on<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.370> similar<00:04:18.760> high<00:04:18.970> fire<00:04:19.299> rate

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
comes on with similar high fire rate

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.839 
comes on with similar high fire rate
stats<00:04:19.930> but<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.739> answer<00:04:20.979> all<00:04:21.099> depends<00:04:21.580> on<00:04:21.700> how

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
stats but the answer all depends on how

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.000 
stats but the answer all depends on how

close your close range encounters gonna

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.660 
close your close range encounters gonna
be<00:04:24.220> because<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.090> PD<00:04:25.419> do<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:25.630> use<00:04:25.750> do<00:04:25.900> benefit

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
be because the PD do we use do benefit

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.790 
be because the PD do we use do benefit

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
from a tighter hipfire spread which

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320 
from a tighter hipfire spread which
means<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.130> can<00:04:29.250> spray<00:04:29.520> people<00:04:29.880> down<00:04:30.090> with

means you can spray people down with

any<00:04:32.040> of<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> carbines<00:04:33.110> increase<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.260> ability

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
any of the carbines increase the ability

attachment<00:04:36.330> you've<00:04:36.990> got<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.140> weapon<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.530> can

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
attachment you've got a weapon that can

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.620 
attachment you've got a weapon that can
quite<00:04:37.950> easily<00:04:38.160> used<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.940> nip<00:04:39.120> out<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.390> tank

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
quite easily used to nip out of the tank

quite easily used to nip out of the tank
lay<00:04:40.200> someone<00:04:40.560> down<00:04:40.800> then<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.250> pop<00:04:41.430> back<00:04:41.640> in

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
lay someone down then just pop back in

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.030 
lay someone down then just pop back in
so<00:04:42.750> well<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.140> just<00:04:43.260> about<00:04:43.380> wraps<00:04:43.500> up<00:04:43.860> another
