00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
the arm and it ended up being about a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
two-hour conversation and and from there
the<00:00:48.000> idea<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.720> job<00:00:48.960> grew<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and you know I mean we I think we have

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.569 
and you know I mean we I think we have
shown<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.349> we're<00:04:17.709> willing<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.070> write<00:04:18.280> checks

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
in order to try and win and I probably a

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.029 
in order to try and win and I probably a
little<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.659> dismayed<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.770> checks

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
little more dismayed that the checks

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.670 
little more dismayed that the checks
haven't<00:04:24.400> produced<00:04:24.610> more<00:04:25.090> winning

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680

he'll put the the personnel in place I

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.830 
he'll put the the personnel in place I
mean<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.490> think<00:05:12.819> he's<00:05:12.969> going<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.210> be<00:05:13.389> deeply

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840

at the next you know fostered by Steve

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.439 
at the next you know fostered by Steve

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
equation and you know that's really the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.010 
equation and you know that's really the
job<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.409> mean<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:39.490> know<00:05:39.610> if<00:05:40.210> Bill<00:05:40.690> would<00:05:40.870> ever

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
job I mean you know if Bill would ever

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.459 
job I mean you know if Bill would ever
coach<00:05:41.319> who<00:05:41.979> would<00:05:42.190> say<00:05:42.400> no<00:05:42.430> right<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.539> um<00:05:43.719> but

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
coach who would say no right the um but

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.019 
coach who would say no right the um but
that's<00:05:44.740> at<00:05:45.069> the<00:05:45.219> moment<00:05:45.250> that's<00:05:45.669> not<00:05:45.789> in<00:05:45.940> the

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
that's at the moment that's not in the

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.200 
that's at the moment that's not in the
cards<00:05:46.210> do<00:05:46.990> you<00:05:47.020> think<00:05:47.440> in<00:05:47.710> retrospect<00:05:48.639> that

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
cards do you think in retrospect that

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.800 
cards do you think in retrospect that
you<00:05:49.900> overpaid<00:05:50.379> for<00:05:50.409> Carmelo<00:05:51.150> no<00:05:52.150> I<00:05:52.180> think<00:05:52.389> we

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
you overpaid for Carmelo no I think we

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.740 
you overpaid for Carmelo no I think we
paid<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.589> least<00:05:54.339> that<00:05:54.550> we<00:05:54.699> could<00:05:55.360> have<00:05:55.509> paid

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
paid the least that we could have paid

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.619 
paid the least that we could have paid
for<00:05:55.779> Carmelo<00:05:56.469> I<00:05:56.889> think<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:57.969> arm<00:05:58.210> there

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
for Carmelo I think that the arm there

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.249 
for Carmelo I think that the arm there
were<00:05:58.779> other<00:05:58.990> teams<00:05:59.319> that<00:05:59.589> were<00:05:59.740> vying<00:06:00.729> for<00:06:01.259> for

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
were other teams that were vying for for

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.010 
were other teams that were vying for for
him<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:03.250> know<00:06:03.370> including<00:06:03.909> Brooklyn<00:06:04.330> the

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
him and you know including Brooklyn the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.959 
him and you know including Brooklyn the
and<00:06:06.719> the<00:06:07.719> I<00:06:08.289> think<00:06:08.710> we<00:06:08.949> did<00:06:09.129> what<00:06:09.310> we<00:06:09.460> had<00:06:09.490> to<00:06:09.699> do

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
and the I think we did what we had to do

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.920 
and the I think we did what we had to do
in<00:06:10.210> order<00:06:10.479> to<00:06:10.509> get<00:06:10.719> him<00:06:10.990> and<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:13.810> know<00:06:13.870> I

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
in order to get him and the you know I

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.939 
in order to get him and the you know I
think<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.319> thing<00:06:14.469> that<00:06:14.589> people<00:06:14.680> don't

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
think the thing that people don't

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.670 
think the thing that people don't
realize<00:06:15.099> about<00:06:15.339> that<00:06:15.849> trade<00:06:16.240> is<00:06:16.509> that<00:06:17.229> if<00:06:17.439> we

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
realize about that trade is that if we

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.029 
realize about that trade is that if we
didn't<00:06:18.159> make<00:06:18.370> that<00:06:18.430> trade<00:06:19.029> right<00:06:19.599> a<00:06:19.889> bunch<00:06:20.889> of

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
didn't make that trade right a bunch of

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.890 
didn't make that trade right a bunch of
those<00:06:21.159> players<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:21.580> we<00:06:21.819> traded<00:06:22.210> away<00:06:22.300> the

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
those players that we traded away the

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.399 
those players that we traded away the
arm<00:06:23.110> were<00:06:23.919> up<00:06:24.520> that<00:06:25.210> that<00:06:25.569> year<00:06:25.900> and<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.199> next

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
arm were up that that year and the next

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.740 
arm were up that that year and the next
year<00:06:26.669> that<00:06:27.669> would<00:06:27.879> be<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.120> team<00:06:28.300> that<00:06:28.330> we<00:06:28.569> have

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
year that would be the team that we have

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.309 
year that would be the team that we have
right<00:06:28.960> now<00:06:28.990> like<00:06:29.949> the<00:06:30.250> arms<00:06:30.669> that<00:06:30.879> you<00:06:31.150> know

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
right now like the arms that you know

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.679 
right now like the arms that you know
Wilson<00:06:32.319> Chandler<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:33.159> and<00:06:33.339> you<00:06:34.330> know<00:06:34.419> and

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
Wilson Chandler and and you know and

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.499 
Wilson Chandler and and you know and
Danilo<00:06:35.199> Gallinari<00:06:35.409> you<00:06:36.130> know<00:06:36.219> were<00:06:36.880> real<00:06:37.360> good

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
Danilo Gallinari you know were real good

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.600 
Danilo Gallinari you know were real good
players<00:06:37.839> and<00:06:37.959> we're<00:06:38.259> going<00:06:38.380> to<00:06:38.440> command<00:06:38.800> a<00:06:39.099> lot

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
players and we're going to command a lot

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.159 
players and we're going to command a lot
more<00:06:39.849> money<00:06:40.060> than<00:06:40.330> they<00:06:40.569> were<00:06:40.630> making

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
more money than they were making

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.600 
more money than they were making
you<00:06:41.499> know<00:06:41.620> when<00:06:42.069> they<00:06:42.159> initially<00:06:42.400> started

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
you know when they initially started

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.510 
you know when they initially started
with<00:06:42.939> us<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.449> in<00:06:44.139> order<00:06:44.379> to<00:06:44.439> resign<00:06:44.860> them<00:06:45.129> we

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
with us and in order to resign them we

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.700 
with us and in order to resign them we
would<00:06:45.729> have<00:06:45.819> had<00:06:45.939> to<00:06:46.090> lock<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.539> team<00:06:46.719> in<00:06:46.930> the

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
would have had to lock the team in the

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.600 
would have had to lock the team in the
and<00:06:48.219> so<00:06:49.110> it<00:06:50.110> wasn't<00:06:50.379> quite<00:06:50.680> as<00:06:50.919> expensive<00:06:51.460> as

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
and so it wasn't quite as expensive as

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.169 
and so it wasn't quite as expensive as
people<00:06:51.939> you<00:06:52.270> know<00:06:52.389> make<00:06:52.629> it<00:06:52.779> out<00:06:52.900> to<00:06:53.050> be
