00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.770
 When can I now show how to set up a tent with the poles on? 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.460
 the inside 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.020
 always start with the gonzo, this means that you lay as flat as possible more and you commit yourself 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.649
 initially on the corners 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.149
 then on the rear front and then you can with the sides 

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.499
 make sure it is just so nice to learn tron ​​so you can do it 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.669
 best fix with ground plans 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.190
 these are supplied as standard with most items 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.640
 then assemble in the stick and put it in the right one 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.229
 sequence complaining on the groundsheet 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.010
 always check the setup instruction here is the correct order of the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.489
 sticks on indicated if that is not the case, you can do it yourself 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.530
 easily done by adding a small beijing or possibly with 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.560
 a color with a waterproof marker 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.890
 when that harassed finished living on the green sail always start with the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.770
 backside this seems illogical ma is actually quite logical because he made it 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.920
 last upwards 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.040
 where they point with the bow to the front, the other poles of the tent 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.310
 lay the bow to the rear more so that you let them get around easier 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.300
 can also print 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.570
 later book of the canopy of course 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.760
 outside the tent 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.830
 the next step is to fasten the outer cloth to the buzzing l 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.750
 make sure it is outside cloth 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.049
 in the right way about the misery sticks fund 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.680
 and yet then become a permanent member 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.480
 always look for a runner with an approach and go from that point 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.890
 the tent fixed guides 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.960
 You will see that while it is staggering that it is different 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.870
 points runners and stitches are always keep an eye on this 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 when setting up the arches it is easiest to go to the front 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.219
 start with the live football 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.450
 when you have pushed it up so that it also looks like the front of the tent 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.170
 partially open air entrance, making it easier to enter 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.510
 to enter the tent and then raise the arch 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.390
 with the help of the supplied strap you can put up for a long time 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 always use the ring for this 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.480
 when the awning is upright you can move the tent and walk and the front arch 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.660
 to press them everywhere 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.830
 put before they offered in line with the reds m already made in close making the tree 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 stays in place it is always the easiest to get from before and after 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.140
 to work because that way you create a workspace for yourself and it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.919
 set up becomes even easier 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.539
 when you pressed the upstairs gays make sure you always put the first feet in 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.229
 line up with a guide 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.869
 that way bogey states more or less in the right direction and how stupid 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.569
 only as evenly as possible to the east if all the trees are upright 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.599
 stand and be ingrid you can always start tanning the tent more 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.899
 in the front 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.469
 fix the corners there 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.729
 then the back also only the corners 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:43.109
 always use the pegs for points where tires are provided 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.139
 at points where a mystical person is sitting at the tent, it is best to go in and out 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:47.889
 default 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.909
 at the moment that the tension in the tent is complete 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.249
 there should always be some guy lines away this summer for that little bit extra 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.249
 stability of the tent during the entire vacation 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.359
 always pay attention 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.009
 that when tightening the guy lines the flap but the 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.449
 guy line is attached to 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.869
 completely tight 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.349
 voltage must be distributed on both sides of the country 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.779
 when in the tent as a whole it is stated how much last is left 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.479
 just to confirm the inner garden 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.799
 this provides a bit of extra insulation and sleeping comfort for an hour on it 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.889
 camping 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.139
 first make the bottom surface wash with the hook is and 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.319
 you can then attach the inner tent to the tent on the top 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.279
 as you can see it needs to be set up with sticks on the inside 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.439
 It doesn't have to be difficult if it continues in the right order 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.959

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.279
