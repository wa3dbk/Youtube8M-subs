 Hello! 

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.960
 My name is Anastasia Kulikova, in this video we will do 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.410
 Here is a flower made of cloth. 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.010
 For the manufacture of such a flower, I used three 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.309
 types of fabric, organza, soft mesh and chiffon. 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.919
 Each of the segments I folded in eight additions and secured 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 pins. 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.599
 Now we will use sketches of petals in the form 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.810
 hearts, the dimensions of which you see on the screen, circle 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.060
 every heart is on a cloth, every piece of cloth is folded 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:47.590
 in eight additions. 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.560
 Cut out the petals. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:04.180
 We have 8 petals of each size, opal 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:27.960
 edges of the petals above the candle. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.240
 It turns out that's such a petal. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 We begin to collect the flower. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.109
 In the foam stick a needle with thread eye down, 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.049
 string the petals on a needle over the edge, first 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.469
 all petals of large size texture of petals choose 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.109
 randomly, then medium sized petals and leaps and bounds 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:03:18.900
 small size. 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.350
 Rose is collected, now carefully remove it from 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:04:23.630
 foam and stitch locking petals. 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:52.030
 So that the middle one is filled with the petals in the center. 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:45.850
 I fastened this flower on a hairpin. 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.400
