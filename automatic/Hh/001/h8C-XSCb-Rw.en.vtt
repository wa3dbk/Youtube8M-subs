00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.959
 my job 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.309
 requires a certain stock 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.059
 crazy 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.829
 I'm doing the job 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.499
 relax and then everything should look 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.499
 as an accident 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 higher skill 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 if you want to know what work 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 Peres refusal her end of punishment 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.980
 meeting decided the case will be happening 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.920
 sheer disappointment was 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.230
 there will be 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 business if presented 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 probably the company's cinema 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060
 it is an error 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.600
 you know our principles from 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.450
 the oldest 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.450
 he needed to be removed 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.680
 team not affected 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 since 2020 when in fact 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 the queue can still be first from the Internet 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.550
 through 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 yesterday in Baku 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.780
 scotch tape 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.910
 these prices 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
 I do not know what tariffs 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 translate the next stage of training 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.070
 yes and now that cormorants 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 finish the work 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.050
 nothing then 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.609
 but it was the best of the best. 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.610
 during the meeting 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.250
 why would he have to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.229

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.229
 earlier 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:13.869
 ceremonies 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:14.759
 in cinemas
