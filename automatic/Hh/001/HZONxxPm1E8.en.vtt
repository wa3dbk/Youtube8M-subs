calm this one talk to y'all briefly
about<00:00:08.260> shooting<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:08.710> basketball<00:00:08.889> very

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
about shooting the basketball very

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.310 
about shooting the basketball very
important<00:00:10.360> fundamental<00:00:10.930> of<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.080> game<00:00:11.290> I

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
important fundamental of the game I

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.500 
important fundamental of the game I
think<00:00:11.740> it's<00:00:11.889> probably<00:00:12.070> most<00:00:12.510> important

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
think it's probably most important

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.810 
think it's probably most important
because<00:00:13.770> the<00:00:14.770> object<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.340> game<00:00:15.369> is<00:00:15.580> to

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
because the object of the game is to

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.000 
because the object of the game is to
score<00:00:16.059> more<00:00:16.209> points<00:00:16.270> in<00:00:16.930> your<00:00:17.110> opponent<00:00:17.740> and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
score more points in your opponent and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.370 
score more points in your opponent and
if<00:00:18.310> you<00:00:18.460> can't<00:00:18.699> shoot<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.330> can<00:00:19.570> score<00:00:20.080> you

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
if you can't shoot you can score you

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.820 
if you can't shoot you can score you
can't<00:00:21.220> score<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.730> can't<00:00:22.000> win<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.320> therefore

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
can't score you can't win so therefore

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.470 
can't score you can't win so therefore
you<00:00:24.099> basically<00:00:25.859> exhale<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:27.310> chances<00:00:28.269> of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
you basically exhale the chances of

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.300 
you basically exhale the chances of
scoring<00:00:28.630> more<00:00:29.019> points<00:00:29.080> if<00:00:29.650> you<00:00:29.800> can't<00:00:30.039> shoot

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
scoring more points if you can't shoot

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.249 
scoring more points if you can't shoot
so<00:00:30.519> that's<00:00:30.669> why<00:00:30.820> I<00:00:30.880> feel<00:00:31.330> it's<00:00:31.539> very<00:00:31.599> important

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
so that's why I feel it's very important

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.430 
so that's why I feel it's very important
it's<00:00:32.529> kind<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.740> like<00:00:32.890> basketball<00:00:33.070> 101<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:35.260> now

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
it's kind of like basketball 101 but now

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's kind of like basketball 101 but now
the<00:00:35.500> funny<00:00:35.860> thing<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.900> it's<00:00:37.900> basketball<00:00:38.110> 101

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
the funny thing is it's basketball 101

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.650 
the funny thing is it's basketball 101
but<00:00:39.160> very<00:00:39.370> few<00:00:39.550> people<00:00:39.760> really<00:00:40.060> take<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.450> time

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
but very few people really take the time

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.990 
but very few people really take the time
to<00:00:40.810> learn<00:00:40.960> how<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.140> shoot<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.740> you<00:00:42.640> should

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
to learn how to shoot and you should

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.120 
to learn how to shoot and you should
really<00:00:43.270> start<00:00:43.570> with<00:00:43.840> shooting<00:00:44.230> because<00:00:44.380> once

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
really start with shooting because once

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.460 
really start with shooting because once
you<00:00:45.250> learn<00:00:45.370> how<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.550> shoot<00:00:45.990> then<00:00:46.990> you<00:00:47.140> can<00:00:47.290> go

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
you learn how to shoot then you can go

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.400 
you learn how to shoot then you can go
into<00:00:47.800> other<00:00:47.950> areas<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.580> expand<00:00:49.000> your<00:00:49.030> gang<00:00:49.480> so

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
into other areas and expand your gang so

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.750 
into other areas and expand your gang so
we're<00:00:50.590> gonna<00:00:50.680> talk<00:00:50.860> about<00:00:50.920> today's<00:00:51.310> shooting

a better shooter the first thing I

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.100 
a better shooter the first thing I
noticed<00:01:26.260> was<00:01:26.380> all<00:01:26.680> shooters<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:28.030> they<00:01:28.780> shoot

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
noticed was all shooters is they shoot

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.480 
noticed was all shooters is they shoot
the<00:01:29.350> same<00:01:29.590> shot<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.409> shoot<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.860> same<00:01:33.040> shot

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the same shot and shoot the same shot

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.860 
the same shot and shoot the same shot
and<00:01:34.150> what<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.080> mean<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.210> mean<00:01:37.300> by<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:37.690> is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
and what I mean what I mean by this is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.410 
and what I mean what I mean by this is
not<00:01:38.020> they're<00:01:38.409> all<00:01:38.530> shooting<00:01:38.800> in<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:40.180> same

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
not they're all shooting in the same

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.330 
not they're all shooting in the same
position<00:01:40.930> like<00:01:41.140> left<00:01:41.530> corner<00:01:41.860> threes<00:01:42.159> or

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
position like left corner threes or

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.860 
position like left corner threes or
right<00:01:42.520> corner<00:01:42.850> threes<00:01:43.120> but<00:01:43.210> what<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.390> mean<00:01:43.659> is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
right corner threes but what I mean is

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.630 
right corner threes but what I mean is
they<00:01:44.440> have<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.680> same<00:01:44.890> form<00:01:45.280> they<00:01:45.430> have<00:01:45.550> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
they have the same form they have the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.050 
they have the same form they have the
same<00:01:45.880> motion<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:47.170> same<00:01:47.380> release<00:01:48.060> for

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
same motion the same release for

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.960 
same motion the same release for
instance<00:01:49.390> if<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.540> took<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.870> picture<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.970> me

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
instance if I took a picture of me

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.490 
instance if I took a picture of me
shooting<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.510> first<00:01:52.690> quarter<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
shooting in the first quarter and the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.410 
shooting in the first quarter and the
third<00:01:53.710> quarter<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.370> shouldn't<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.090> able<00:01:55.270> to

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
third quarter you shouldn't be able to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.100 
third quarter you shouldn't be able to
tell<00:01:56.460> by<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.520> picture<00:01:58.210> because<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.810> form

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
tell by the picture because the form

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.870 
tell by the picture because the form
would<00:01:59.229> be<00:01:59.290> identical<00:01:59.799> that's<00:02:00.460> shooting<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
would be identical that's shooting the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.270 
would be identical that's shooting the
same<00:02:01.060> shot<00:02:01.390> every<00:02:01.420> time<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.890> want<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.159> do

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
same shot every time and you want to do

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100 
same shot every time and you want to do
this<00:02:03.430> because<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.760> builds<00:02:04.060> consistency<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
this because it builds consistency and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.140 
this because it builds consistency and
it's<00:02:05.530> gonna<00:02:05.710> improve<00:02:06.460> your<00:02:06.520> shooting

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
it's gonna improve your shooting

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.610 
it's gonna improve your shooting
percentages<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:09.220> almost<00:02:09.489> like<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> machine

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
percentages it's almost like a machine

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.959 
percentages it's almost like a machine
you<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.739> machine<00:02:12.099> does<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> same<00:02:12.670> thing

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
you know machine does the same thing

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.819 
you know machine does the same thing
every<00:02:13.359> single<00:02:13.540> time<00:02:13.749> that's<00:02:14.200> what<00:02:14.409> high<00:02:14.620> what

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
every single time that's what high what

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.740 
every single time that's what high what
you<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.189> be

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you want to be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.910 
you want to be
when<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:15.990> shoot<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> ball<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.560> want<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
when we shoot the ball you want to be a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.220 
when we shoot the ball you want to be a
machine<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.910> wanna<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> same<00:02:18.480> form<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
machine you wanna have the same form the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.500 
machine you wanna have the same form the
same<00:02:19.470> mechanics<00:02:20.430> every<00:02:20.850> time<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.180> shoot<00:02:21.330> that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
same mechanics every time you shoot that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
same mechanics every time you shoot that
ball<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.770> second<00:02:23.070> thing<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.730> really<00:02:24.480> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
ball the second thing I I really really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
ball the second thing I I really really
noticed<00:02:26.280> when<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.050> shooters<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.500> in

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
noticed when all the shooters have in

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.610 
noticed when all the shooters have in
common<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.660> they<00:02:30.660> all<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.840> great<00:02:31.260> balance

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
common is they all have great balance

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.750 
common is they all have great balance
when<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.100> shoot<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.520> ball<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:35.430> all<00:02:35.580> have

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
when they shoot the ball they all have

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.830 
when they shoot the ball they all have
great<00:02:36.000> balance

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
great balance

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 
great balance
very<00:02:37.410> seldom<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> shooter<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.880> good

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
very seldom you see a shooter a good

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.530 
very seldom you see a shooter a good
shooter<00:02:40.100> shoot<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> ball<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.670> then<00:02:41.820> fall

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
shooter shoot the ball and then fall

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.230 
shooter shoot the ball and then fall
back<00:02:42.840> or<00:02:42.870> shoot<00:02:43.650> their<00:02:44.370> lean<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.790> left<00:02:45.030> or

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
back or shoot their lean and left or

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.900 
back or shoot their lean and left or
right<00:02:45.530> they<00:02:46.530> always<00:02:46.920> land<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.640> same<00:02:47.850> spot

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
right they always land in the same spot

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.180 
right they always land in the same spot
or<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.830> slightly<00:02:49.830> forward<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:52.620> only<00:02:52.830> time<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
or a slightly forward the only time you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
or a slightly forward the only time you
should<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.760> off<00:02:53.970> balance<00:02:54.210> is<00:02:54.600> when

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
should really be off balance is when

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.510 
should really be off balance is when
you're<00:02:55.290> shooting<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.650> fade<00:02:55.830> away<00:02:56.100> trying<00:02:56.430> to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
you're shooting a fade away trying to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.430 
you're shooting a fade away trying to
get<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.300> know<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.020> daylight<00:02:58.200> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
get you know a little bit of daylight a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.070 
get you know a little bit of daylight a
little<00:02:58.680> bit<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.860> space<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.430> your<00:02:59.610> shot<00:02:59.820> off

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
little bit of space to get your shot off

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.380 
little bit of space to get your shot off
that's<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.320> simple<00:03:01.860> physics<00:03:02.390> you're

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that's just simple physics you're

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.660 
that's just simple physics you're
shooting<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.810> ball<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.980> shooting<00:03:05.280> something

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
shooting the ball is shooting something

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.160 
shooting the ball is shooting something
forward<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.180> you're<00:03:06.270> leaning<00:03:06.420> back<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.990> mean

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
forward and you're leaning back I mean

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.650 
forward and you're leaning back I mean
think<00:03:07.470> about<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
think about it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.750 
think about it
that<00:03:09.660> isn't<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.990> make<00:03:10.170> sense<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.460> I<00:03:11.490> mean

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that isn't you make sense so I mean

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.520 
that isn't you make sense so I mean
that's<00:03:11.880> all<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.210> say<00:03:12.420> about<00:03:12.450> balance<00:03:13.170> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that's all I can say about balance it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.620 
that's all I can say about balance it's
very<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.280> key<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:14.820> make<00:03:15.000> sure<00:03:15.180> you're

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
very very key just make sure you're

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.790 
very very key just make sure you're
balanced<00:03:16.080> when<00:03:16.230> you're<00:03:16.320> shooting<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.650> ball

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
balanced when you're shooting the ball

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.890 
balanced when you're shooting the ball
and<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.550> you're<00:03:17.670> balanced<00:03:18.090> your<00:03:18.330> percentages

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and if you're balanced your percentages

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.120 
and if you're balanced your percentages
are<00:03:19.080> gonna<00:03:19.230> go<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.530> they're<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> more

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
are gonna go up they're gonna be a more

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.540 
are gonna go up they're gonna be a more
consistent<00:03:20.459> shooter<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:23.010> third<00:03:23.220> thing<00:03:23.400> I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
consistent shooter the third thing I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.010 
consistent shooter the third thing I
noticed<00:03:24.500> about<00:03:25.500> shooters<00:03:26.239> they<00:03:27.239> all<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
noticed about shooters they all have a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.270 
noticed about shooters they all have a
quick<00:03:28.860> release<00:03:30.830> when<00:03:31.830> they<00:03:31.950> shoot<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.340> ball

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
quick release when they shoot the ball

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.640 
quick release when they shoot the ball
and<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.790> kind<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.150> deceptive<00:03:36.959> because<00:03:37.110> I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and this is kind of deceptive because I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.229 
and this is kind of deceptive because I
know<00:03:37.860> shooters<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.489> don't<00:03:38.790> necessarily

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
know shooters that don't necessarily

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.140 
know shooters that don't necessarily
have<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.660> quick<00:03:39.930> release<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.940> they're<00:03:41.940> always

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
have a quick release but they're always

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.410 
have a quick release but they're always
ready<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.660> shoot<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> speak<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:45.239> always

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
ready to shoot so to speak so you always

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.970 
ready to shoot so to speak so you always
have<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.660> be<00:03:45.810> ready<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> shoot<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.680> call<00:03:46.860> it

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
have to be ready to shoot we call it

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.610 
have to be ready to shoot we call it
being<00:03:47.100> shot<00:03:47.489> ready<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.989> if<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.410> ball

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
being shot ready so if you know the ball

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.990 
being shot ready so if you know the ball
is<00:03:49.650> coming<00:03:50.010> your<00:03:50.160> way<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.340> should<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.700> down

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
is coming your way you should be down

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.280 
is coming your way you should be down
and<00:03:51.239> ready<00:03:51.390> always<00:03:52.380> have<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.739> gun<00:03:53.640> loaded<00:03:54.290> and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
and ready always have the gun loaded and
