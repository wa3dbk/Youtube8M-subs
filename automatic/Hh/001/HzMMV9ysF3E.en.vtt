huge advantage over the other mediums

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.150 
huge advantage over the other mediums
however<00:00:24.669> something<00:00:25.419> to<00:00:25.540> really<00:00:25.779> consider<00:00:26.160> for

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
however something to really consider for

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.729 
however something to really consider for
me<00:00:27.309> it's<00:00:27.550> been<00:00:27.790> one<00:00:28.059> of<00:00:28.090> my<00:00:28.329> preferred<00:00:29.320> mediums

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
me it's been one of my preferred mediums

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.639 
me it's been one of my preferred mediums
as<00:00:29.919> well<00:00:30.070> because<00:00:30.809> the<00:00:31.809> end<00:00:31.989> result<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.529> the

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
as well because the end result of the

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.290 
as well because the end result of the
painting<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.219> you<00:00:33.370> have<00:00:33.550> much<00:00:33.760> more<00:00:34.000> brilliant

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
painting is you have much more brilliant

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.560 
painting is you have much more brilliant
than<00:00:34.839> oils<00:00:35.260> or<00:00:35.530> pastels<00:00:35.949> or<00:00:36.129> acrylics<00:00:36.609> the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
than oils or pastels or acrylics the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.779 
than oils or pastels or acrylics the
painting<00:00:37.929> pops<00:00:38.170> out<00:00:38.410> more<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.859> the<00:00:39.489> reason

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
painting pops out more and the reason

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.669 
painting pops out more and the reason
for<00:00:39.969> that<00:00:40.089> is<00:00:40.329> that<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.989> light<00:00:41.170> goes<00:00:41.410> right

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
for that is that the light goes right

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.799 
for that is that the light goes right
through<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.039> pigment<00:00:42.280> as<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.609> film<00:00:43.059> comes<00:00:43.510> back

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
through the pigment as a film comes back

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.169 
through the pigment as a film comes back
and<00:00:44.079> bounces<00:00:44.530> off<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:45.010> white<00:00:45.550> paper<00:00:45.850> and

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
and bounces off the white paper and

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.180 
and bounces off the white paper and
everything<00:00:46.989> looks<00:00:47.230> like<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.530> has<00:00:47.710> more<00:00:47.949> light

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
everything looks like it has more light

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.540 
everything looks like it has more light
on<00:00:48.399> it

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.970 

and<00:00:56.300> believe<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.660> or<00:00:56.780> not<00:00:56.960> all<00:00:57.290> those<00:00:57.740> three

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and believe it or not all those three

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.070 
and believe it or not all those three
combined<00:00:58.460> will<00:00:59.120> end<00:00:59.360> up<00:00:59.570> with<00:00:59.750> all<00:00:59.930> these

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
combined will end up with all these

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.530 
combined will end up with all these
different<00:01:00.290> colors<00:01:00.650> here<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.489> we<00:01:05.180> have<00:01:05.360> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
different colors here so we have to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.690 
different colors here so we have to
intermix<00:01:06.110> these<00:01:06.440> there<00:01:07.160> are<00:01:07.280> hundreds<00:01:07.580> of

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
intermix these there are hundreds of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.790 
intermix these there are hundreds of
combinations<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:09.110> with<00:01:09.320> my<00:01:09.470> three-step

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
combinations but with my three-step

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.280 
combinations but with my three-step
system<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:10.580> much<00:01:10.790> easier<00:01:11.240> we're<00:01:11.810> going<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
system it's much easier we're going to

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.130 
system it's much easier we're going to
now<00:01:12.950> place<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.520> colors<00:01:13.850> on<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.270> hours<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.110> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
now place the colors on the hours of the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.250 
now place the colors on the hours of the
clock<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:16.820> need<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.030> green<00:01:17.300> which<00:01:17.810> will<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:18.140> the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
clock we need a green which will be the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.410 
clock we need a green which will be the
result<00:01:18.620> of<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:19.100> transparent<00:01:20.000> yellow<00:01:20.180> and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
result of a transparent yellow and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.570 
result of a transparent yellow and
ultramarine<00:01:20.930> blue<00:01:20.960> always<00:01:21.470> grab<00:01:22.369> your

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
these colors you can work with just a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.100 
these colors you can work with just a
few<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.490> very<00:02:22.880> good<00:02:23.360> palette<00:02:23.780> would<00:02:23.930> be

another<00:02:40.370> way<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.579> control<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.760> do<00:02:43.909> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
another way to control this you do the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.619 
another way to control this you do the
same<00:02:44.239> thing<00:02:44.769> if<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.849> feel<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.329> have<00:02:47.450> too

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
same thing if you feel that you have too

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.420 
same thing if you feel that you have too
much<00:02:47.780> water<00:02:48.049> here<00:02:48.379> in<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.769> case<00:02:49.069> that's<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
much water here in this case that's a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.369 
much water here in this case that's a
very<00:02:49.609> dark<00:02:49.879> value<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.870> don't<00:02:51.109> have<00:02:51.230> to

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
very dark value so I don't have to

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.979 
very dark value so I don't have to
squeeze<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> water<00:02:52.159> out<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.579> my<00:02:52.700> brush<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.750> if

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
squeeze the water out of my brush but if

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.890 
squeeze the water out of my brush but if
I<00:02:54.140> get<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> lighter<00:02:54.799> value<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.629> I<00:02:56.629> still

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
I get to a lighter value and I still

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.050 
I get to a lighter value and I still
want<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.140> control<00:02:57.680> my<00:02:57.859> edges<00:02:58.250> then<00:02:58.879> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
want to control my edges then the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.259 
want to control my edges then the
technique<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.659> take<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.049> paper<00:03:00.530> towel<00:03:01.269> hold

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
technique is to take a paper towel hold

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.920 
technique is to take a paper towel hold
your<00:03:02.980> brush<00:03:03.980> upright<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:04.730> squeeze<00:03:05.720> it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
your brush upright like this squeeze it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.879 
your brush upright like this squeeze it
at<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.319> ferrule

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
at the ferrule

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.670 
at the ferrule
let<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.790> water<00:03:08.030> run<00:03:08.150> down<00:03:08.359> now<00:03:09.349> you<00:03:09.409> have<00:03:09.650> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
let the water run down now you have a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.399 
let the water run down now you have a
moist<00:03:10.010> brush<00:03:10.340> once<00:03:10.639> again<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:12.170> can<00:03:12.319> do

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
moist brush once again and you can do

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.809 
moist brush once again and you can do
the<00:03:12.560> same<00:03:12.739> thing<00:03:16.540> that's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.659> very<00:03:17.840> light<00:03:18.079> value

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
the same thing that's a very light value

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:26.470 
the same thing that's a very light value
but<00:03:19.819> it's<00:03:19.939> still<00:03:20.120> being<00:03:20.299> controlled<00:03:25.480> and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
but it's still being controlled and

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
but it's still being controlled and
again<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.680> see<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.269> two<00:03:30.019> holes<00:03:30.290> in

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
again you can see that the two holes in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.339 
again you can see that the two holes in
the<00:03:30.560> eight<00:03:30.769> are<00:03:31.040> not<00:03:31.340> closing<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> darker

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
the eight are not closing so a darker

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.280 
the eight are not closing so a darker
value<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.769> controlled<00:03:34.280> by<00:03:34.659> picking<00:03:35.659> up<00:03:35.810> barely

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
value is controlled by picking up barely

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.619 
value is controlled by picking up barely
moist<00:03:36.680> paint<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.939> lighter<00:03:38.150> value<00:03:38.569> is

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
moist paint and a lighter value is

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.720 
moist paint and a lighter value is
controlled<00:03:39.019> by<00:03:39.079> sucking<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.680> water<00:03:39.709> away<00:03:40.489> or

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
controlled by sucking the water away or

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.990 
controlled by sucking the water away or
out<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.299> bristles

for example I feel that that's a little
bit<00:06:07.639> unclear<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.050> can<00:06:09.289> just<00:06:09.499> go<00:06:09.650> in<00:06:09.770> there

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
bit unclear so I can just go in there

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.070 
bit unclear so I can just go in there
and<00:06:10.129> as<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:11.150> can<00:06:11.330> see<00:06:11.479> it<00:06:11.599> gives<00:06:11.750> you<00:06:11.870> like<00:06:12.050> a

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
and as you can see it gives you like a

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.670 
and as you can see it gives you like a
50%<00:06:12.789> value<00:06:13.900> difference<00:06:14.900> between<00:06:15.319> that<00:06:15.620> and

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
50% value difference between that and

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.920 
50% value difference between that and
that

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930

that's<00:06:24.930> great<00:06:25.380> let's<00:06:26.040> start<00:06:26.370> now<00:06:26.520> with<00:06:26.580> the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
that's great let's start now with the

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.550 
that's great let's start now with the
impression<00:06:28.440> of<00:06:28.740> flowers<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.490> whatever<00:06:30.560> some

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
stems back here something we'll just

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:46.240

carry the eye is a term that I use quite

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.890 
carry the eye is a term that I use quite
a<00:06:48.960> bit<00:06:49.340> because<00:06:50.340> you<00:06:50.970> want<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.570> viewer<00:06:51.810> to

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
a bit because you want the viewer to

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.190 
a bit because you want the viewer to
move<00:06:52.290> in<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.560> painting<00:06:53.570> so<00:06:54.570> your<00:06:54.720> parent<00:06:55.170> your

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
move in the painting so your parent your

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.920 
move in the painting so your parent your
painting<00:06:55.650> carries<00:06:56.160> the<00:06:56.340> viewer<00:06:57.770> for<00:06:58.770> a<00:06:58.830> ride

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
painting carries the viewer for a ride

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.660 
painting carries the viewer for a ride
to<00:07:00.930> different<00:07:01.290> parts<00:07:01.590> so<00:07:02.220> you<00:07:02.310> can<00:07:02.490> see

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
to different parts so you can see

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:35.230 
to different parts so you can see
everything
