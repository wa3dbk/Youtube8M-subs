00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.109 
too solid in my head so I'm like okay
let's<00:01:42.109> scratch<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.439> video<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.219> let's<00:01:43.549> do<00:01:43.850> a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
let's scratch that video and let's do a

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.149 
let's scratch that video and let's do a
breakdown<00:01:44.780> video<00:01:45.139> because<00:01:45.590> sonic<00:01:45.889> can<00:01:46.009> break

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
breakdown video because sonic can break

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.940 
breakdown video because sonic can break
down<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.819> sonic<00:01:47.240> CGI<00:01:47.600> footage<00:01:48.259> was<00:01:48.439> from<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
down the sonic CGI footage was from the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.129 
down the sonic CGI footage was from the
Sonic<00:01:49.429> Generations<00:01:49.459> game<00:01:50.329> at<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.749> end<00:01:50.780> of

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
Sonic Generations game at the end of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.410 
Sonic Generations game at the end of
each<00:01:51.289> level<00:01:51.590> psych<00:01:51.979> would<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.789> breakdance

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
each level psych would do a breakdance

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.179 
each level psych would do a breakdance
for<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.869> every<00:01:54.229> time<00:01:54.469> you<00:01:54.740> get<00:01:54.859> a<00:01:54.920> high

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
for you every time you get a high

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.760 
for you every time you get a high
schooler<00:01:55.609> or<00:01:55.909> top<00:01:56.270> rank<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:57.259> is<00:01:57.409> where<00:01:57.649> we

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
schooler or top rank so this is where we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
schooler or top rank so this is where we
got<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.069> break<00:01:58.249> dance<00:01:58.520> from<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.999> really<00:01:59.420> neat

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
got the break dance from the really neat

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.749 
got the break dance from the really neat
part<00:01:59.840> about<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.259> sonic<00:02:00.469> CGI<00:02:00.920> footage<00:02:01.459> is<00:02:01.609> that

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
part about the sonic CGI footage is that

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.580 
part about the sonic CGI footage is that
the<00:02:01.850> background<00:02:02.420> isn't<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.899> same<00:02:03.109> color<00:02:03.380> as

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the background isn't the same color as

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.179 
the background isn't the same color as
Sonic

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
Sonic

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.249 
Sonic
so<00:02:04.459> I<00:02:04.490> can<00:02:04.789> easily<00:02:05.029> key<00:02:05.539> out<00:02:05.779> the<00:02:06.020> background

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
so I can easily key out the background

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.529 
so I can easily key out the background
while<00:02:06.770> using<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.249> posit<00:02:07.609> lab<00:02:07.759> Pro<00:02:07.999> I<00:02:08.030> was<00:02:08.330> able

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
while using the posit lab Pro I was able

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.240 
while using the posit lab Pro I was able
to<00:02:08.780> key<00:02:09.050> out<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.440> color<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.830> Sonic's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
to key out the color of Sonic's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
to key out the color of Sonic's
background<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.910> wanted<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.959> in

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
background I wanted so I like to be in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.990 
background I wanted so I like to be in
the<00:02:12.200> environment<00:02:12.380> as<00:02:12.800> real<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.160> possible<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.940> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the environment as real as possible so I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.910 
the environment as real as possible so I
was<00:02:14.150> focused<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.750> three<00:02:15.050> things<00:02:15.319> coloring

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
technically saying it's real so I wanted

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.810 
technically saying it's real so I wanted
Sonic<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.020> have<00:02:33.170> its<00:02:33.350> own<00:02:33.470> shadow<00:02:33.740> on<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.640> time
