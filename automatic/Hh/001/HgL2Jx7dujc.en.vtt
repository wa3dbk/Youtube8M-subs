00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
lure to it and it really attractive I

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.300 
lure to it and it really attractive I
ran<00:01:20.920> some<00:01:21.189> sample<00:01:22.049> test<00:01:23.049> sets<00:01:23.319> earlier<00:01:24.009> in<00:01:24.189> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
ran some sample test sets earlier in the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.419 
ran some sample test sets earlier in the
year<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.700> nuisance<00:01:25.539> cone<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.170> they<00:01:26.829> really

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
year a nuisance cone and they really

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.779 
year a nuisance cone and they really
were<00:01:27.789> attracted<00:01:28.359> to<00:01:28.389> it<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> little<00:01:30.639> stuck

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
were attracted to it that a little stuck

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.279 
were attracted to it that a little stuck
here<00:01:30.999> so<00:01:31.179> I<00:01:31.240> guess<00:01:31.420> I'll<00:01:31.569> just<00:01:31.719> break<00:01:31.959> another

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
here so I guess I'll just break another

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.389 
here so I guess I'll just break another
one

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.749 

Sabo<00:01:37.909> brand<00:01:38.210> long-range<00:01:38.750> lure<00:01:39.369> put<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.399> little

Sabo brand long-range lure put a little

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.880 
Sabo brand long-range lure put a little
on<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.149> lip<00:01:41.390> here<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.719> it'll<00:01:42.710> eventually

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
on the lip here and it'll eventually

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
on the lip here and it'll eventually
fall<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.579> there<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:46.070> that's<00:01:46.490> all<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.820> takes<00:01:46.969> to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
fall in there and that's all it takes to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880 
fall in there and that's all it takes to
catch<00:01:48.860> raccoons<00:01:50.530> hopefully<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:51.649> show<00:01:51.829> you

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890

down<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:06.229> see<00:02:06.409> what<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.649> shoreline

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
down but you see what the shoreline

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.199 
down but you see what the shoreline
looks<00:02:07.459> like<00:02:08.950> kind<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.039> intentional<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:10.970> pull

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
looks like kind of intentional we pull

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.990 
looks like kind of intentional we pull
over<00:02:11.590> when<00:02:12.590> there's<00:02:12.799> either<00:02:12.950> feeder<00:02:13.340> streams

long<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:12.200> Z<00:03:13.200> traps<00:03:13.790> very<00:03:14.790> good<00:03:15.090> job

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
long this is on Z traps very good job

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
long this is on Z traps very good job
it's<00:03:16.350> got<00:03:16.470> three<00:03:16.740> traps<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.760> got
