00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
incredibly annoying as i would too if I

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.970 
incredibly annoying as i would too if I
was<00:05:10.540> being<00:05:10.780> saddled<00:05:10.990> like<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.440> but<00:05:11.950> I

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
was being saddled like that but I

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.320 
was being saddled like that but I
actually<00:05:12.370> had<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.640> lot<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:12.850> fun<00:05:13.030> with<00:05:13.120> this<00:05:13.210> game

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
actually had a lot of fun with this game

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.850 
actually had a lot of fun with this game
because<00:05:13.660> most<00:05:14.140> of<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.410> games<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.710> this

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
because most of the games in this

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.180 
because most of the games in this
bracket<00:05:15.250> or<00:05:16.050> 45<00:05:17.050> seconds<00:05:17.500> long<00:05:17.650> two<00:05:17.920> minutes

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
bracket or 45 seconds long two minutes

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.530 
bracket or 45 seconds long two minutes
long<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.610> max<00:05:19.380> because<00:05:20.380> there<00:05:20.590> someone<00:05:21.310> dies

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
long the max because there someone dies

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.360 
long the max because there someone dies
usually<00:05:22.540> right<00:05:23.470> on<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.680> opener<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.190> it's

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
usually right on the opener and it's

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.420 
usually right on the opener and it's
like<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:25.000> one-hit<00:05:25.690> fest<00:05:25.960> but<00:05:26.230> this<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.250> really

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
like a one-hit fest but this is a really

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.850 
like a one-hit fest but this is a really
good<00:05:27.550> game<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:27.820> lasted<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.180> long<00:05:28.300> time<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.860> it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
good game it lasted a long time and it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.950 
good game it lasted a long time and it
was<00:05:30.040> incredibly<00:05:30.910> annoying<00:05:31.480> trying<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.810> get<00:05:31.930> a
