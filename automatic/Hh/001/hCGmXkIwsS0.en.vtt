00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
here and there is an arrow here on the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.240 
here and there is an arrow here on the
lid

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
lid

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.490 
lid
oh<00:02:00.280> that's<00:02:01.030> right<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.780> actually<00:02:02.170> needs<00:02:02.320> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
oh that's right this actually needs to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.420 
oh that's right this actually needs to
be<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.980> left<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.460> then<00:02:03.820> turn<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.630> then<00:02:04.900> be

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
be to the left and then turn and then be

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.130 
be to the left and then turn and then be
aligned<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.820> learning<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.450> only<00:02:07.570> my<00:02:07.750> second

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
aligned so learning it's only my second

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.290 
aligned so learning it's only my second
time<00:02:08.170> using<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.740> thing<00:02:08.920> all<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.220> gotta<00:02:09.700> do<00:02:10.000> is

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
time using this thing all I gotta do is

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.640 
time using this thing all I gotta do is
hit<00:02:11.190> soup<00:02:12.190> Oh<00:02:12.520> soup<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.480> 30<00:02:13.930> minutes

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
hit soup Oh soup in 30 minutes

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.410 
hit soup Oh soup in 30 minutes
oh<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:15.040> god<00:02:15.250> chicken<00:02:15.640> soup<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.910> 30<00:02:16.090> minutes

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
oh my god chicken soup in 30 minutes

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.090 
oh my god chicken soup in 30 minutes
really<00:02:16.600> that'll<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> test<00:02:17.560> will<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
really that'll be the test will the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.980 
really that'll be the test will the
chicken<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.580> cooked<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.590> go

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
chicken be cooked here we go

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.150 
chicken be cooked here we go
so<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.020> think<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.500> building<00:02:23.740> up<00:02:24.010> pressure

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
so I think now it's building up pressure

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280 
so I think now it's building up pressure
and<00:02:24.610> then<00:02:24.820> it'll<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> 30<00:02:25.540> minute

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and then it'll have a 30 minute

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.940 
and then it'll have a 30 minute
countdown

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
countdown

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
countdown
I'll<00:02:27.370> see<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.700> 30<00:02:27.910> minutes<00:02:28.360> hey<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.020> Suzie
