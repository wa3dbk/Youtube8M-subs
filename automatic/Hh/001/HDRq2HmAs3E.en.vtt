00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
i believe so far now the only thing i

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.370 
i believe so far now the only thing i
want<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.790> get<00:04:39.850> into<00:04:40.000> before<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:40.660> close<00:04:41.350> this

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
want to get into before I close this

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.670 
want to get into before I close this
video<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.729> this<00:04:43.180> video<00:04:43.450> rather<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
video is and this video rather the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.469 
video is and this video rather the
processor<00:04:45.490> I<00:04:45.520> heard<00:04:45.760> was<00:04:45.940> pushed<00:04:46.270> back

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
processor I heard was pushed back

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.270 
processor I heard was pushed back
because<00:04:46.630> people<00:04:47.050> wanted<00:04:47.320> better<00:04:47.590> hardware

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
because people wanted better hardware

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.370 
because people wanted better hardware
because<00:04:48.880> it's<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> successor<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.960> nexus

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
because it's the successor to the nexus

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.430 
because it's the successor to the nexus
one<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.430> what<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.639> being<00:04:52.060> said<00:04:52.419> they<00:04:53.050> want<00:04:53.350> to

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
one so what that being said they want to

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.770 
one so what that being said they want to
go<00:04:53.560> ahead<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.040> make<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.760> dual<00:04:55.150> core<00:04:55.479> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
go ahead and make it a dual core and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.629 
go ahead and make it a dual core and
they<00:04:56.440> had<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> problem<00:04:56.919> with<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.340> because

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
they had a problem with that because

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.270 
they had a problem with that because
gingerbread<00:04:58.479> does<00:04:58.870> not<00:04:59.080> support<00:04:59.530> dual<00:04:59.919> core

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
gingerbread does not support dual core

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.930 
gingerbread does not support dual core
well<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:02.260> when<00:05:02.530> I<00:05:02.560> say<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.610> phone<00:05:03.820> will

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
well so when I say that the phone will

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.730 
well so when I say that the phone will
work<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.419> will<00:05:04.539> power<00:05:04.780> up<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.320> would<00:05:05.440> be<00:05:05.470> super

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
work it will power up it would be super

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.980 
work it will power up it would be super
fast<00:05:06.130> but<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.150> doesn't<00:05:07.449> it's<00:05:07.630> not<00:05:07.720> two

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
fast but it doesn't it's not two

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.810 
fast but it doesn't it's not two
compatible<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.620> software<00:05:08.949> itself<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:09.729> they

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
compatible to software itself so they

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.090 
compatible to software itself so they
want<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.090> wait<00:05:10.210> until<00:05:10.360> they<00:05:10.930> get<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.710> next

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
want to wait until they get the next

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.270 
want to wait until they get the next
version<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.610> android<00:05:12.729> 3.0<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:14.039> forgot<00:05:15.039> what's
