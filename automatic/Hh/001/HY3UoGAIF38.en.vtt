00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.810
 hello dear friends nice that again 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.670
 daily at briggs photo this time have 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.349
 I'm back to the lego movie for you 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.860
 namely the 70 814 march robot resp 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:37.000
 can 's tractor from the year 2014 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.760
 a total of 708 parts three mini figure plus 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.710
 a kitty and the age recommendation of 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.640
 lego is between 8 and 14 years old 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.050
 a total of 17 stickers yes and 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.019
 Of course we'll take a look at the whole set 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.190
 again gradually and we start 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.320
 of course as always with the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.510
 mini figures the first figure is the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.860
 hero of the film and indeed mrt comes with 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.899
 of course again with his 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 Orange construction worker suit with the mad 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.789
 printed reflector strip he features 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.830
 Turning one head over one 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.210
 He grins and is happy and happy 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.110
 on the other side looks very 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.119
 foolhardy 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.369
 because the color also in his big 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.160
 beautiful robot underpants again 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.289
 name tag these two figures are 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.630
 not about terminator but in one 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.280
 big factory made skeletons 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.649
 that's why the two are similar 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 are completely identical and serve 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.030
 actually just as a cannon food for ms 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.459
 big robots do not actually provide 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.280
 big obstacle there are simply flattened 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.869
 rolled the last mini figure is no 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 minifigures actual sense but 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.149
 a cat of 14 sharing the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.979
 so-called princess a dog kitty 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.140
 known from the film here they are called 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.060
 now it will scratch if done correctly 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.160
 then it turns bright red and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.560
 can be right on the bag 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.640
 you can see that in the movie here too 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.310
 you see already now the complete 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 set up with minifigures now can 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.420
 one also ever the size difference 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 see very well and we look at each other 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.750
 now once the constructeurs or ms 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.060
 robot something beautiful in detail 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.209
 I think everywhere there are small ones 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 to discover and recognize things 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.569
 Of course the different ones too 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.380
 Construction vehicles he is using for his 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.070
 big robot has used 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.770
 da roboters in total 36 cm high and with 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.120
 spread arms 34 cm wide and 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.370
 if I have been to them a bit now 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.800
 he already swings back and forth like himself 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.660
 the wrecking ball on the two cranes 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.100
 and I would move away from it 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.050
 do not like to be hit 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.880
 the next week is here on 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.640
 right arm and consists of two 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.560
 black course bucket together 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 Connected again by being good here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.880
 a blue rubber band that provides 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.220
 that snap this lightning fast 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.230
 So if now about one of these evil 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.300
 skeleton rons gets in the way 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.180
 Just take this or force it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.680
 also disappear in it 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.990
 can extend the arms completely 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 of the robot unfortunately not for it there 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.590
 here at this point again 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.840
 knee joint but that is only after 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.860
 up and down further direction 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.410
 shoulder then there is one more 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.180
 You can then turn the ball joint around 360 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.490
 turn and bend 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.200
 on the other side the link name 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.570
 is there then the next weapon one 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.000
 even if it looks like a roller 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.120
 big massive part consists of here 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.340
 three single round elements in the film 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.410
 use the roller around the micro manager 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.300
 to give a good deal on the turnip 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.800
 or of course the scanner despite 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.260
 to make room if such a roller is 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.210
 and quite a massive part in the back 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.340
 we still find the roller on the tree 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 a wheel that can be turned and the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.450
 Rotate roller optically 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.100
 just like on the right side you can 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.380
 do not fully extend the arm 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.330
 but more or less up and 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.920
 Click below to see the ball joint 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.670
 for having him around once 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.980
 can turn 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.350
 on the back we find blue 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.840
 parts that are cement mixers are 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.209
 Of course decorated with sticker in total 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.150
 as already mentioned 17 pieces the parts 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.890
 but are quite rare so in his 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.050
 robot well protected it exists here 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.300
 on the shoulder still so loud armor 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.740
 This is also flexible but what I am 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.750
 think of it very nice 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.450
 are these little silver antennas 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.550
 that's against mini figures 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.620
 unfortunately there is a whole model only 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.500
 we can print two printed elements 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.709
 but can be found at the front of the protective grille 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.770
 driver cabin 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.720
 the printed ones flow in the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.490
 There is no driver's cab with him 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.250
 So he has to stand here for this 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.820
 two levers extra with the servant then 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.220
 his 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.410
 Robot below the driver's cab 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.020
 we find a flow with a code 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.060
 is the lego movie video game for the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.210
 code if you enter this one clicks 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.240
 I believe the construction workers pants and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.520
 scratched the same as in this set of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.800
 Incidentally, code is not a sticker, either 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.050
 but a kind of laser engraving 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.520
 if we look a little deeper now 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.200
 we see the hip is the hip 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.330
 By the way, traffic jams and grazes that is 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.700
 So we can do the lower half and 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.680
 Do not turn the upper half separately 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.660
 but what we can do is they are 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.600
 Legs that works wonderfully over 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.760
 this technique elements around the roller skates 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.050
 to replay similar movement 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.570
 the whole thing is really wonderful 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.820
 suitable however tilted thereby 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.300
 constantly to him neat way to 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.160
 put 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.630
 then both legs should work again 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.090
 stand firmly on the ground 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.670
 March robot is something dresses and 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.620
 more modified than in the original movie im 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.240
 film he looks much bigger and 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.280
 cheaper the whole is also very 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.350
 clearly here on the chain feet 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.120
 Here we see the rubber chains 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.980
 the whole thing works wonderfully 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.520
 You also do not push everything back and forth 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.950
 problem 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.050
 but in the original movie we see the 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.550
 Chains are only low and off 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.860
 plastic as we do it for example by techniques 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.930
 and so we come to the site management 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.090
 It's a big big book this time 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.830
 which I also thinks is very nice 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.210
 it is again a part of trainer and the 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.550
 bags are numbered 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.410
 in the beginning there are the same with the two 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.540
 skeletons and on the next page 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.820
 is already kratzke assembled 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.380
 At the beginning you wanted the robot only in 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.870
 lie together after that comes already the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.640
 By the way, we find rare parts of the legs 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.380
 even in this set apart from the 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.690
 the two blue cement people already 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.100
 mentioned there are also many yellow ones 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.200
 elements for example here 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.270
 these two carrier parts to which the 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.550
 demolition ball are attached there are 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.410
 so far only in this set also the 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.870
 Bauer shoveling is not quite so 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.240
 Often there is still such a good thing 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.980
 a few product information is here 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.710
 once again for you the parts list 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.270
 and there bulky thicker bow I 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.430
 thank you in any case for the 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.440
 attention and hope you schartner 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.440
 back here at Briggs photo ZYS
