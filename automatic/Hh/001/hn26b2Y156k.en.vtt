the most important factor to getting
better<00:00:02.220> braking<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.120> remember<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.540> your

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
better braking is to remember that your

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.749 
better braking is to remember that your
front<00:00:03.990> brake<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.470> by<00:00:04.680> far<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.220> away<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.730> most

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
front brake is by far and away the most

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.299 
front brake is by far and away the most
effective<00:00:06.569> way<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.779> slow<00:00:07.230> down<00:00:07.500> some<00:00:08.189> people

effective way to slow down some people
actually<00:00:08.550> advocate<00:00:09.120> using<00:00:09.300> only<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> front

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
actually advocate using only the front

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
actually advocate using only the front
brake<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.590> effectiveness<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> theory

brake for effectiveness and the theory
is<00:00:12.030> sound<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.690> get<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> most<00:00:13.080> effective

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
is sound you get the most effective

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
is sound you get the most effective
braking<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:14.969> at<00:00:15.150> which<00:00:15.240> your

touching the ground it will help you

touching the ground it will help you
slow<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.240> particularly<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> first

slow down particularly when you first

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420 
apply your brakes and you're gauging
just<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:30.840> hard<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.590> pull<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.040> you

just how hard you can pull them on you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
just how hard you can pull them on you
should<00:00:32.610> almost<00:00:32.790> always<00:00:33.030> apply<00:00:33.840> both<00:00:34.320> brakes

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
should almost always apply both brakes

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
should almost always apply both brakes
together<00:00:34.980> although<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.730> necessarily<00:00:36.300> with

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the same force the back brake requires

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
much less in order to use your front

much less in order to use your front
brakes<00:00:40.829> safely<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> adjust<00:00:41.850> your

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
brakes safely you need to adjust your

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
brakes safely you need to adjust your
weight<00:00:42.510> distribution<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> bike<00:00:43.680> to

weight distribution on the bike to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
weight distribution on the bike to
counter<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> forces<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.120> deceleration<00:00:45.899> the

counter the forces of deceleration the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
counter the forces of deceleration the
harder<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> brake<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.520> important<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
harder you brake the more important it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
harder you brake the more important it
is<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.690> body<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> correct

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
is to get your body in the correct

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.520 
is to get your body in the correct
position<00:00:50.360> when<00:00:51.360> riding<00:00:51.629> at<00:00:51.809> speed<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.230> tend<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
position when riding at speed I tend to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
position when riding at speed I tend to
ride<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> drops<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> main

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
ride on the drops and one of the main

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
ride on the drops and one of the main
reasons<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> extra<00:00:55.320> control<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
reasons is the extra control we have in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.439 
reasons is the extra control we have in
this<00:00:56.219> position<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:56.820> riding<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.270> higher

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this position when riding at higher

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
this position when riding at higher
speeds<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.129> due<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
speeds and a lot of this is due to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
speeds and a lot of this is due to
braking<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.780> only<00:01:01.050> hands<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.800> secure<00:01:02.160> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
braking not only hands really secure in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
braking not only hands really secure in
this<00:01:02.370> position<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.449> body<00:01:03.660> weight

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this position because your body weight

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
this position because your body weight
is<00:01:04.019> lowered<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.650> able<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> cope<00:01:05.189> much

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
is lowered you're able to cope much

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.429 
is lowered you're able to cope much
better<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> increased<00:01:06.570> braking<00:01:06.810> forces

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
better with the increased braking forces

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
better with the increased braking forces
the<00:01:07.979> main<00:01:08.189> issue<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.610> braking<00:01:09.000> hard<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the main issue with braking hard is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.910 
the main issue with braking hard is
going<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> handlebars<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.799> by

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
going over the handlebars but by

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.469 
going over the handlebars but by
straightening<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.460> arms<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.939> pushing<00:01:12.390> your

back side behind the saddle you can

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.060 
back side behind the saddle you can
counter<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> force<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.420> deceleration<00:01:16.070> for

counter that force of deceleration for
gentle<00:01:17.400> braking<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.000> fine<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> hold<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.810> to
