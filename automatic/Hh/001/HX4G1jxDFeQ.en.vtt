 alves in the 11th minute 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.820
 the defender sent a real zapatazo and the goalkeeper viguera 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:18.730
 inexplicably even as a statue to contribute its bit 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 to the first goal of Brazil 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.850

 third of the dunga 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 the face of the Uruguayan goalkeeper said it all

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.480
 Uruguayan area 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.580
 the midfielder threw the maximum penalty and tricked the goalkeeper to close off 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.770
