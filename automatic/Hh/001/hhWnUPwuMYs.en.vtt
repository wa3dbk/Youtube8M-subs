00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
tired and we had two rails down that I

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.820 
tired and we had two rails down that I
didn't<00:05:36.940> expect<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.509> the<00:05:37.960> first<00:05:38.199> right<00:05:38.500> we<00:05:38.650> had

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
didn't expect and the first right we had

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.520 
didn't expect and the first right we had
down<00:05:39.240> we<00:05:40.240> seriously<00:05:40.509> got<00:05:40.900> into<00:05:41.139> a<00:05:41.199> bit<00:05:41.349> of<00:05:41.380> a

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
down we seriously got into a bit of a

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.870 
down we seriously got into a bit of a
tangle<00:05:41.949> so<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:43.810> was<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.710> was<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.400> lot<00:05:45.610> closer

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
tangle so that was that was a lot closer
