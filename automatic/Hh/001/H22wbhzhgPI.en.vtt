00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.679 
much sense because the sega game gear
was<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.140> color<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.090> gameboy<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.360> released

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
was in color and gameboy just released

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
was in color and gameboy just released
the<00:01:45.840> gameboy<00:01:46.229> color<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.579> in

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the gameboy color so for this to be in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219 
the gameboy color so for this to be in
black<00:01:47.909> black<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> white<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.899> sort<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
black black and white was sort of a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
black black and white was sort of a
drawback<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.340> anyone<00:01:50.640> wanted<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> go

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
drawback now think anyone wanted to go

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
drawback now think anyone wanted to go
back<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.600> black<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.899> white<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.350> hit<00:01:52.530> colored

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
back so black and white one hit colored

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.389 
back so black and white one hit colored
consoles<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.840> also<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> back<00:01:55.500> light<00:01:55.770> which

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
consoles it also has a back light which

consoles it also has a back light which
is<00:01:56.430> cool<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.030> came<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.439> um<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:59.100> far<00:01:59.549> as

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
a metal gear solid game was actually

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
a metal gear solid game was actually
supposed<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
supposed to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.950 
supposed to
come<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.850> was<00:02:15.030> canceled<00:02:15.600> um

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
come out on this but it was canceled um

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.360 
come out on this but it was canceled um
but<00:02:18.960> yeah<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.800> graphics<00:02:20.070> were

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
but yeah like the graphics were

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.550 
but yeah like the graphics were
definitely<00:02:20.910> better<00:02:21.180> than<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.480> Game<00:02:21.690> Boy<00:02:21.720> but

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
definitely better than the Game Boy but

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.930 
definitely better than the Game Boy but
for<00:02:22.710> some<00:02:22.890> reason<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.550> take<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
for some reason just going to take off a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.370 
for some reason just going to take off a
lot<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.360> people<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.600> don't<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.930> change<00:02:25.170> I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
lot of people just don't like change I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.470 
lot of people just don't like change I
guess<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.450> um<00:02:28.520> another<00:02:29.520> feature<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.300> had

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
guess and um another feature that it had

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.480 
guess and um another feature that it had
was<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:31.500> actually<00:02:31.709> hook<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.310> up

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
was that you can actually hook this up

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.300 
was that you can actually hook this up
to<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.910> Internet<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:34.050> had<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> modem<00:02:34.920> rich<00:02:35.160> you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
to the Internet it had a modem rich you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.040 
to the Internet it had a modem rich you
can<00:02:35.459> buy<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:36.120> was<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> first<00:02:36.660> portable

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
can buy this was the first portable

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
can buy this was the first portable
where<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.440> actually<00:02:37.590> buy<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> modem<00:02:38.220> but

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
where you can actually buy a modem but

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.340 
where you can actually buy a modem but
unfortunately<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> internet<00:02:39.990> features

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
unfortunately the internet features

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
unfortunately the internet features
weren't<00:02:40.709> too<00:02:40.830> good<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:41.250> even<00:02:41.850> though<00:02:41.940> you

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
weren't too good because even though you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150 
weren't too good because even though you
hooked<00:02:42.240> up<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> Internet<00:02:42.990> basically<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
hooked up to the Internet basically it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.770 
hooked up to the Internet basically it
was<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.550> text<00:02:45.030> internet<00:02:45.390> where<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
was just text internet where you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.449 
was just text internet where you
