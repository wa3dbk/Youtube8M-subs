00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:10.290
 five things that in maine crepe and mail 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 mining or digging down 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.960
 the guy is walking in this mine that was not 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.810
 no staircase that was bad weather do not think 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 nothing than bruno definitely blocks 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
 the only thing I think is because the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.590
 hell because he coal but diamond 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.050
 which is nothing good today and did not accept 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.289
 The Little Coach Calls The Little Coach 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.289
 good diamond which Brazil love pa 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:54.030
 according to the guy just died for 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 the one for the lava is to get the diamond 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 cough item at home only that this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 walking is good 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.519
 now I'm going out a little bit in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.119
 however nothing to do my friend and kill 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.979
 half green is joy to see that at home 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 because if you gave a late one that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.840
 If you're going to get better, do not come here. 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 so do not need to push the focus off 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.270
 of education pushes not everything you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 help in now because it's because it's 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.770
 very ill 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.000
 I'm going to have to call the doctor who told you 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 friend is not friend, yes friend of evil 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 horse or number I see here pro 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.729
 teaching tower that promised if there were any 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.729
 something from death to wash 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.320
 there's nothing left 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 One thing I think the technique in this 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.970
 game that according to my friends and ends 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.579
 up not stop or crazy for 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.579
 next season we will assume in the canon and 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.049

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:25.470
 The guy died now I went up on his 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.320
 tree here for me and now it's got 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.630
 welcomed by my friends, right? 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:39.290
 if you fall into it you do not die right 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.290
 the lupe died 50 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.320

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.110

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:25.830
 Can you break and have more here? 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:28.170
 I'll just try to break the delay, but 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.640
 When the group is going to be very strong I think 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.160
 that way stronger than in mali 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.780
 craft an armature of this 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.320
 sword will dominate the maine world 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.320
 craft 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.910

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.680

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.310
 break this diamond 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.290
 Do you know that with gold pick change 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.160
