00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this house here he's also gone ahead and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
this house here he's also gone ahead and
fired<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.940> fatherland<00:01:00.449> which

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fired up for the fatherland which

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
fired up for the fatherland which
basically<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:01.800> believe<00:01:02.070> gives<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> could

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
basically i believe gives them you could

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
basically i believe gives them you could
tell<00:01:02.850> by<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.239> graphic<00:01:03.420> extra<00:01:03.840> armor

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
tell by the little graphic extra armor

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
tell by the little graphic extra armor
they<00:01:04.350> heal<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.970> extra

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
they heal and I think that's extra

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.490 
they heal and I think that's extra
movement<00:01:06.420> speed<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
movement speed but I have to look that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
movement speed but I have to look that
up<00:01:07.560> exactly<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> could<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:09.890> something<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
up exactly it could be a something to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
up exactly it could be a something to
that<00:01:11.100> effect<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.520> anyhow<00:01:11.790> good<00:01:12.720> move<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that effect but anyhow good move and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.539 
that effect but anyhow good move and
he's<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.560> ahead<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.010> fight<00:01:14.280> off<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
he's going to go ahead and fight off the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
he's going to go ahead and fight off the
rest<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> riflemen<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.689> who<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.900> just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
rest of the riflemen here who are just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
rest of the riflemen here who are just
kind<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> hiding<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> house<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.100> even<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
kind of hiding in the house I even a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.920 
kind of hiding in the house I even a
house<00:01:17.700> by<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.909> way<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> great<00:01:18.479> move<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
house by the way is a great move if you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.149 
house by the way is a great move if you
just<00:01:19.110> need<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> stall<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:19.950> while

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just need to stall for a little while

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.289 
just need to stall for a little while
because<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.729> gives<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
because it just gives you a lot more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.649

that's<00:04:08.360> actually<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> skill<00:04:08.990> but<00:04:09.110> that's<00:04:09.290> not

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
that's actually a skill but that's not

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.190 
that's actually a skill but that's not
what<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.500> meant<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.730> once<00:04:11.480> again<00:04:11.600> automate<00:04:12.080> is

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
what I meant so once again automate is

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.540 
what I meant so once again automate is
now<00:04:12.350> taking<00:04:12.770> control<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.190> right<00:04:13.370> hand

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
now taking control of this right hand

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.100 
now taking control of this right hand
side<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.820> map<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.120> because<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.690> his<00:04:14.810> handy

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
side of the map and because of his handy

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.600 
side of the map and because of his handy
footwork<00:04:15.530> during<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:15.980> whole<00:04:16.130> fighting<00:04:16.489> he

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
footwork during that whole fighting he

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.130 
footwork during that whole fighting he
actually<00:04:16.730> still<00:04:17.060> has<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.209> significant<00:04:17.840> size<00:04:18.020> of

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
actually still has a significant size of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.860 
actually still has a significant size of
the<00:04:18.230> left<00:04:18.380> hand<00:04:18.560> side<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.860> map<00:04:19.840> Stefan<00:04:20.840> is

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
the left hand side of the map Stefan is

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.600 
the left hand side of the map Stefan is
trying<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.440> recap<00:04:21.770> some<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:22.250> frankly

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
trying to recap some of it but frankly

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.220 
trying to recap some of it but frankly
he's<00:04:22.760> using<00:04:23.060> wounded<00:04:23.420> engineers<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.960> do<00:04:24.110> it

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
he's using wounded engineers to do it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.330 
he's using wounded engineers to do it
and<00:04:24.320> it's<00:04:24.410> going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.560> be<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> little<00:04:24.890> harder<00:04:25.190> for

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and it's going to be a little harder for

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.520 
and it's going to be a little harder for
him<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.490> actually<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.930> back<00:04:27.140> some<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.470> this

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
him to actually get back some of this

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.140 
him to actually get back some of this
stuff<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:28.010> lot<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.550> see<00:04:28.670> if<00:04:28.760> he's<00:04:28.880> gonna<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.060> able

stuff a lot to see if he's gonna be able

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.580 
stuff a lot to see if he's gonna be able

back<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.360> bit<00:04:41.600> as<00:04:41.720> we<00:04:41.870> take<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.050> look

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
back to that a bit as we take a look

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.720 
back to that a bit as we take a look
around<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.560> map<00:04:42.740> here<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.370> bit<00:04:43.520> more

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730

let's<00:04:44.660> see<00:04:44.780> these<00:04:44.990> infantry<00:04:45.530> are<00:04:45.620> retreating

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
and here we go here is the Puma this is

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.540 
and here we go here is the Puma this is
what<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.290> want<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.620> see<00:04:48.740> almost<00:04:48.980> even<00:04:49.340> have<00:04:49.460> this

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
what I want to see almost even have this

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.250 
what I want to see almost even have this
stuff<00:04:50.150> on<00:04:50.240> even<00:04:50.480> as<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.600> second<00:04:51.020> one<00:04:51.110> coming

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
stuff on even as a second one coming

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.360 
stuff on even as a second one coming
right<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:51.500> um<00:04:52.330> once<00:04:53.330> again<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.650> airborne

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
right now um once again the the airborne

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.700 
right now um once again the the airborne
commander<00:04:55.850> ottoman<00:04:56.390> actually<00:04:56.990> has<00:04:57.230> map

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
commander ottoman actually has map

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.830 
commander ottoman actually has map
control<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.370> terms<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.760> command<00:04:59.360> points<00:04:59.540> but

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
control in terms of command points but

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.810 
control in terms of command points but
really<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:00.380> think<00:05:00.650> Stefan<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.190> about<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.610> push

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
really I think Stefan is about to push

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.760 
really I think Stefan is about to push
back<00:05:02.000> out<00:05:02.210> with<00:05:02.360> all<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.660> his<00:05:02.720> infantry<00:05:03.140> with

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
back out with all of his infantry with

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.760 
back out with all of his infantry with
his<00:05:03.950> HMG<00:05:04.610> team<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.090> with<00:05:05.419> his<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:06.169> Pumas<00:05:06.560> and

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
his HMG team and with his to Pumas and

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.230 
his HMG team and with his to Pumas and
that'll<00:05:06.980> probably<00:05:07.190> all<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:07.610> takes<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:07.970> end<00:05:08.120> the

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
that'll probably all it takes to end the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.730 
that'll probably all it takes to end the
game<00:05:08.270> at<00:05:08.540> this<00:05:08.660> point<00:05:08.750> because<00:05:08.960> as<00:05:09.230> we<00:05:09.410> can<00:05:09.530> see

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
game at this point because as we can see

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.850 
game at this point because as we can see
it<00:05:10.580> looks<00:05:10.730> like<00:05:11.020> autumn<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.140> might<00:05:12.320> just<00:05:12.680> be

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
it looks like autumn it might just be

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.070 
it looks like autumn it might just be
getting<00:05:13.010> an<00:05:13.190> artillery<00:05:13.550> no<00:05:14.030> he's<00:05:14.270> not<00:05:14.419> I<00:05:14.780> would

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
getting an artillery no he's not I would

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.330 
getting an artillery no he's not I would
love<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.290> have<00:05:15.440> seen<00:05:15.620> an<00:05:15.740> anti-tank<00:05:16.190> gun

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
love to have seen an anti-tank gun

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.830 
love to have seen an anti-tank gun
coming<00:05:16.550> out<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.760> here<00:05:16.850> but<00:05:17.000> instead<00:05:17.270> he's

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
coming out of here but instead he's

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.150 
coming out of here but instead he's
going<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.080> be<00:05:18.169> getting<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.440> single<00:05:18.740> Greyhound

going to be getting a single Greyhound

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
and that may not be enough to do it for

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.460 
and that may not be enough to do it for
him<00:05:20.780> we<00:05:21.530> switch<00:05:21.770> back<00:05:21.950> to<00:05:21.980> stuff<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.460> here

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.420 
with the Pumas this is something that is
very<00:05:32.450> tricky<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.080> do<00:05:33.200> properly<00:05:33.650> oh<00:05:33.890> look<00:05:34.340> at

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
very tricky to do properly oh look at

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.460 
very tricky to do properly oh look at
that<00:05:34.460> pop<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.419> last<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.810> flame<00:05:36.020> engineers

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
that pop the last of the flame engineers

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.470 
that pop the last of the flame engineers
before<00:05:36.860> they<00:05:36.980> could<00:05:37.040> lay<00:05:37.220> their<00:05:37.250> minds<00:05:37.760> it's

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
before they could lay their minds it's

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.580 
before they could lay their minds it's
very<00:05:38.660> tricky<00:05:38.840> to<00:05:39.050> push<00:05:39.200> all<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.440> way<00:05:39.470> into

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
very tricky to push all the way into

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.840 
very tricky to push all the way into
someone's<00:05:39.890> base<00:05:40.100> because<00:05:40.400> typically<00:05:40.700> you

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
someone's base because typically you

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.760 
someone's base because typically you
overextend<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.660> lose<00:05:41.810> your<00:05:41.960> vehicle's<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.560> lot

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
feel like the greyhound does a little

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.560 
feel like the greyhound does a little
bit<00:05:56.360> better<00:05:56.480> damage<00:05:56.930> versus<00:05:57.260> vehicles<00:05:57.680> but

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
bit better damage versus vehicles but

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.340 
bit better damage versus vehicles but
you<00:05:59.570> wouldn't<00:05:59.900> know<00:05:59.960> by<00:06:00.440> looking<00:06:00.470> at<00:06:02.350> by

you wouldn't know by looking at by
looking<00:06:03.530> at<00:06:03.710> their<00:06:03.860> damage<00:06:04.220> types<00:06:04.460> because<00:06:04.610> it

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
looking at their damage types because it

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.950 
looking at their damage types because it
looks<00:06:05.000> it<00:06:05.210> looks<00:06:05.240> like<00:06:05.510> i<00:06:05.600> have<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.810> same
