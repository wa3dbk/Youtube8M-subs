00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
with onion and mix it well by doing this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
with onion and mix it well by doing this
you're<00:01:26.280> making<00:01:26.670> sure<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.210> onion<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> covered

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you're making sure that onion is covered

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
you're making sure that onion is covered
in<00:01:28.259> honey<00:01:28.470> place<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> ingredients<00:01:29.670> into<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
in honey place the ingredients into a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
in honey place the ingredients into a
gallon<00:01:30.840> jar<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> push<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> down<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.520> your

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
gallon jar and push it down with your

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
gallon jar and push it down with your
hands<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.720> reason<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.649> that<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
hands the reason for that is that you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
hands the reason for that is that you
don't<00:01:35.159> want<00:01:35.310> any<00:01:35.460> air<00:01:35.670> bubbles<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
don't want any air bubbles and that's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.350 
don't want any air bubbles and that's
why<00:01:36.810> I've<00:01:36.960> sliced<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> other<00:01:37.740> video<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.850> onion

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
why I've sliced the other video in onion

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
why I've sliced the other video in onion
ring<00:01:39.570> size<00:01:39.899> because<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.740> kept<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> down

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
ring size because it's kept it down

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
ring size because it's kept it down
better<00:01:41.869> leave<00:01:42.869> about<00:01:43.259> quarter<00:01:43.740> space<00:01:44.009> from

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
better leave about quarter space from

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
better leave about quarter space from
the<00:01:44.490> top<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> your<00:01:45.450> enzyme<00:01:45.899> won't

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the top so that your enzyme won't

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
the top so that your enzyme won't
overflow<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.189> easier<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
overflow and it's easier to put a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.930 
overflow and it's easier to put a
smaller<00:01:48.390> glass<00:01:48.689> jar<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.380> push<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> down<00:01:49.950> onion

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
smaller glass jar to push it down onion

for<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.880> guess<00:02:41.120> what<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.810> real<00:02:42.050> hard

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
for now but guess what the real hard

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.900 
for now but guess what the real hard
work<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.830> keeping<00:02:43.280> up<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.580> it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
work is keeping up with it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.120 
work is keeping up with it
place<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.780> enzyme<00:02:45.140> near<00:02:45.380> where<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.920> see

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
place the enzyme near where you can see

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.760 
place the enzyme near where you can see
daily<00:02:46.580> enzymes<00:02:47.510> don't<00:02:47.810> like<00:02:47.959> bright<00:02:48.260> sunlight

daily enzymes don't like bright sunlight

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.490 
daily enzymes don't like bright sunlight
so<00:02:49.010> don't<00:02:49.220> keep<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.520> outside<00:02:49.930> check<00:02:50.930> daily<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
so don't keep it outside check daily to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.710 
so don't keep it outside check daily to
make<00:02:51.530> sure<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.160> there<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.400> no<00:02:52.550> mold<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.120> stir

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
make sure that there is no mold and stir

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.080 
make sure that there is no mold and stir
once<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.170> day<00:02:54.350> you'll<00:02:55.100> notice<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.880> honey

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
once a day you'll notice that the honey

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.750 
once a day you'll notice that the honey
is<00:02:56.240> watery<00:02:56.600> because<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.140> onion<00:02:57.470> juice<00:02:57.740> after<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
is watery because of onion juice after a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.520 
is watery because of onion juice after a
couple<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.090> weeks<00:02:59.150> you'll<00:02:59.750> notice<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.320> there

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
couple of weeks you'll notice that there

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.890 
couple of weeks you'll notice that there
is<00:03:00.560> no<00:03:00.860> more<00:03:01.070> bubble<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.390> that

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
is no more bubble and then this that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.199 
is no more bubble and then this that
means<00:03:03.230> it's<00:03:03.440> fermented<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.610> now<00:03:04.820> close

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
means it's fermented you can now close

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.870 
means it's fermented you can now close
the<00:03:05.450> lid<00:03:05.660> tightly<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.530> start<00:03:07.100> using<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.580> I've

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
the lid tightly and start using it I've

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.090 
the lid tightly and start using it I've
heard<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.989> takes<00:03:09.170> four<00:03:09.440> months<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:10.070> I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
heard that it takes four months but I

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.400 
heard that it takes four months but I
like<00:03:10.370> using<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:10.970> couple<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.300> weeks<00:03:11.540> enzyme

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
like using it in couple of weeks enzyme

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.350 
like using it in couple of weeks enzyme
will<00:03:12.620> taste<00:03:12.830> different<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.400> time<00:03:13.640> passes<00:03:13.940> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
will taste different as time passes and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.180 
will taste different as time passes and
it<00:03:14.600> will<00:03:14.720> almost<00:03:14.959> taste<00:03:15.350> like<00:03:15.560> mild<00:03:15.860> onion

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
it will almost taste like mild onion

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.940 
it will almost taste like mild onion
