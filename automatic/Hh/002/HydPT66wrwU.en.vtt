00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.160
 yourself first or misha climate all 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 known and secondly here is such a kent 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 and if you are interested in the details then 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.010
 night there and attain so it was really 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 Actually 2 and 1 have forgotten at mum well I think that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
 for I will take him in April if she does not 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 will enjoy or let enjoy 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 the more so because the product is very economical 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 I obviously have enough for a very long time for me 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.969
 already was once such but already took 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.550
 familiar then do I have enough 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 a few months then enjoyed it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 so half well, that is, it is packed like this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.070
 got flakonchika poured obviously enough for me 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 for a long time 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 I think you know what tinted such 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 bright pigment of lips and cheeks theoretically well 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
 although I do not really imagine how you can 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 put on my cheeks it's all there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.859
 two shades of cherry red, and there I 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.280
 it is cherry shades and it looks like it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.280
 so here 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.430
 so here it is shaded on the idea of i 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.790
 think is intended to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.100
 give your lips enough 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.369
 permanent natural effect 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.800
 Well, roughly speaking, bathing lips in reality 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.960
 Of course not everything is not so easy on the hand 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.030
 he so easily shaded 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.240
 Of course, on the lips with quite difficult 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.340
 as acting as i use the product i 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.520
 I beat a little and that is the inner one 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.410
 let's say the lip line is just light 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.550
 such concerning holding on top 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.860
 lower lip then when he sits on our 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.039
 in the same way the second layer is stuffed just 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.020
 more so in a big way and all afterwards 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.509
 from above I apply the moisturizing balm for 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.259
 lips and quite with this you can walk 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.640
 few hours lips look good enough 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.800
 building a second way of applying this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.289
 tinto can be applied under lipstick 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.120
 then if you even eat lipstick 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.750
 cut you off and stay on your lips and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.519
 lips 2 without bright they are harmful to me 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 like a person loving principle bright 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.090
 lip color is important i remember by the way 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.850
 particular tricks from mom dragged off if 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.650
 remember before we had such 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.600
 sold chemically from lipstick green 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 the colors that became on the lips or 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.920
 pink or orange there was an option 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 here is my mom then in the early 90s on 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.130
 never used lipstick just 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 so she wore and under lipstick 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.380
 usual and that's just the same then lipstick 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.750
 same principle, I did not start persistence 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.090
 and this chemical was completely eternal 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 and then she is there after the campaign where 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.280
 1 after lunch or a cafe or 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.170
 some party at work lipstick 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.989
 always remained own that's for sure 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.910
 I also use this tint now 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.390
 a little dry lips therefore 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.750
 You need a balm first. 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.730
 and the second such flaw is he is a little bit 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.340
 she has a not very pleasant taste 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.350
 but in general, at a price in my 4 dollars 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.940
 for two here such here for the tip or 5 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.980
 dollars case for you leave a link 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.700
 at the seller below all look no longer 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.510
 remember 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.550
 how much did it cost I am quite happy 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.519
 quality is not an hour here of course I think 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.620
 purchase convince into a very fit but for now 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.629
 decided to stop she put on tony 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.489
 pray that I have this one 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.769
 brand who is not the sea is called principle 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.319
 tender how many years ago very much 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.709
 thundered throughout at least in Russia 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.140
 exactly and exactly for what reason 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:53.500
 the whole order started this kind of climate 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:56.239
 Misha I have this shade number 23 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 when I put it 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.430
 reproaching the parcel from the post office and 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.549
 put on the skin decided that I was wrong 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.989
 color because you see this 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.110
 grayish what are you on i think that on 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.870
 all she just he does not fit and I do not 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.140
 I know what I'm going to do with him 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.479
 actually it is perfect for application like this 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 as he I have not seen that at least one 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.220
 I have adjusted the product like this 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.440
 under the skin tone while he removes from me 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.180
 skin inclined to impulse will be so 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
 say yes as a principle in asians on 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 don't really see it now 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.180
 yellow red 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.250
 the cold light from the window of the document is redder 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.210
 I actually have a little skin pigment 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.860
 yellowish its naturally here it is 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.960
 removes these yellowings from me 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.940
 skin remove redness here in this 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.380
 areas that vessels are close to me 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.610
 located can not skin the place of execution he 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.910
 perfectly adapts while doing it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.220
 completely invisible on the skin I take it off 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.200
 non hydrophilic oil no hydrophilic 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.410
 oils i wash it off with an important tool for 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.440
 makeup removal and basically after there 3 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.870
 3 4 napkin quite clean so i 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.780
 I believe that the skin is cleaned from it 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.919
 very pleased with this product thought that 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.680
 I will get more in the near future 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.780
 several different shades for the summer on 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.550
 other seasons because this one 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.130
 would fit me perfectly for the winter like 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.000
 it is possible that it will be more likely for spring no 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.789
 It is suitable for winter because all the same 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.060
 Asians they are white-skinned and therefore China 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.610
 light shades probably 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.110
 from not worth it also that nice seller 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.180
 put small gifts one of them 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.980
 it was a cleansing plaster for the nose but he 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.820
 unfortunately very and what turned out to be white 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:45.350
 Kim did not even cling books first 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.350
