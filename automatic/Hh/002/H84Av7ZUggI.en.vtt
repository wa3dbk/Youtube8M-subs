 informative well come on I'm here with 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.110
 means a person who says the following 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.150
 My name is I will not tell a single one. 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.650
 person to you like an opinion 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.059
 I will introduce some of the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.250
 situation so you can better understand my 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.129
 family in several people who have 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.019
 and everyone thinks I owe it is 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.629
 What will I do with my life? 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.059
 and I did the course as it was at the end of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.879
 I saw that I did not want to pursue a career. 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.820
 and then went to my 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.420
 my family and started studying for 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.759
 contest is and how the whole family of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.890
 concurred with a successful all 

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.869
 I really believe that I can get through and 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.020
 It 's better for my life, but I 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.930
 I would like someone's opinion that 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.700
 someone who is personal and as I have heard 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.280
 talk a lot you decided to send it and if 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.860
 read well is more expensive we will 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.859
 talk soon what I would like 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.829
 I used to say it's a great option. 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:28.039
 career and has a number of 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.670
 advantage but it is not the only choice of 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.170
 career 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.819
 so it's not because everyone is 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.079
 making a contest is because your family 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.979
 doing a contest you have to do 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.409
 contest 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.719
 You will do the contest if you are. 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.299
 their livelihoods was the 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.340
 best solution that's as it was the milk of 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.200
 children are going there you will do 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.969
 Contest is what you want for you. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.159
 now make a contest that everyone is 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.289
 doing is a bore we only have one 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.420
 life to spend people understand must not 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.819
 spend our lives realizing the dream and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.069
 the plans of others you have to be 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.079
 protagonist of his own story 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.719
 It's when your family says it 's the 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.069
 better for you, what's cool, do you have 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.319
 a family caring for the best 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.750
 for you for sure they are not you 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.120
 giving a bad tip but if you want 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.490
 undertake to set up your business you want 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.340
 take a course abroad if you want 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.590
 after studying that produced names is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 big project of your life 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.030
 a point is not the contest that goes 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.640
 solve your life and you talk 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.590
 that has a health problem 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.400
 What's troubling to take 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.430
 doctor and gets sleepy and if I think 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.650
 that this is hindering the study and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.069
 that if I think this will prevent 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.519
 the person passes and that I am affects the 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.280
 memory is c'mon, everyone has some 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.530
 problems to face the tours of this 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.700
 these people are the other're unemployed 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 the other is to support the children and 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.290
 hath no help sometimes set 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.380
 sound and you have to take care of himself 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.319
 another is poor, the other has limitations 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.260
 health problems and each one has to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.049
 face its use to its history 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.230
 personnel and their personal difficulties in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.599
 I think in the medical point of view 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.690
 Who do you have to talk to the doctor? 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.670
 but what I know of people who with 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 serious health problems have 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.410
 including problems relating to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.879
 functioning of blind people with 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.440
 epilepsy taking medication than 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.420
 I got sleepy but went there and studied 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.200
 He has passed first and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.970
 exists then if you have within the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 future one that good you have a family 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.650
 who cares about you who gives you strength 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.280
 who had no team thinking of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.290
 you 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.569
 2 who has to choose what you go 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.500
 do you were born panel your mother was born 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.970
 Grandma 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 it is clear that this decision has to be a 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.349
 responsible decision nÃ© 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 if not what I want is to be a poet and a 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.120
 work is something that goes against 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.829
 my nature, why do not you give it to me? 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.440
 to find a composition 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.500
 so what is the composition you want 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.200
 for your life is health problem the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.790
 public tender is the question of whether you 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.090
 and I resolved that I would recommend 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.760
 You do not even know if the book is a life without 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.070
 limits and the book are two books and one 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.470
 indomitable all two book of nickel 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.630
 and chic if you do not know where I think 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.440
 You go in the bookstore with course. 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.580
 in free etc 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.259
 aponto com 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.449
 What has there is that is a citizen a guy 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.520
 very nice that does not have the arms and 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.680
 legs and managed to get over it if 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.689
 making a person who has 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.669
 helped a lot of people made a difference 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.580
 so I always like to cite the case 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.490
 that it is an extremely serious and 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.889
 that he did not give up and managed to 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.740
 back up then the question is the 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.750
 next, despite what I would like to 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.389
 to know if you think I really 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.400
 I can pass on some contest is 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.310
 Although there is no memory of this, there is 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.889
 family stimulus well memory recommend 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.020

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.360
 reader the thousand book with ricardo soares 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.150
 Dynamic reading and memorizing speaks of 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.520
 memory and has a specific book on 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.319
 mental maps is with felipe lima and can 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.990
 to be that the mental map has people if it gives 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.550
 super good with the mental map and can 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.250

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.759

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.020
 stop believing in your family is not 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.270
 My family has more to say.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.969

 living your great adventure is and was 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.779
 said the following has the feeling of being 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.479
 wasting time you're going to be losing 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.940
 time if you do not have a dream if you 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.009
 living the dream of another person if 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.449
 You are going towards 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.610
 Believe you're not wasting time. 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.039
 even the question of having taken a course 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.599
 discovered that it is not this 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.360
 Glad you went there and discovered that 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.370
 It was bad if you were not going to 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.520
 the rest of life wondering how it is 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.930
 that would have been I would have liked it if you 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.330
 would have liked or not 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.220
 or even when you go to the 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.780
 wrong way if you take the 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.210
 the awareness that it is not what 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.500

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.040
 things and will make sure that at least 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.240
 is least not what you want you 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.340
 want something else 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.720
