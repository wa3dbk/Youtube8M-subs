00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.399
 It seems like it's up to now What is the performance sp? 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.920
 Or is it not there or does ed woman Aoda want appeal 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:28.279
 When 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.890
 Appeal I think that it is the characteristic that I worked hard here 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.950
 After all that power feel is just smooth 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.630
 But the v-4 public officer wants to feel comfortable 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 By the way the engine is rear 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.610
 Because it is a British sports tourer as the concept of that car 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.409
 Well anyway it's comfortable and comfortable 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.340
 But it is to be sporty 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.010
 First of all, the hardest part was the arrangement of the m4-that spirit 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.840
 Then how do you place the member of the clamp 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.600
 First of all, you have to move 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 Because of that p 28 of playing p To then 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.039
 It is the other side even if I remove the green 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.160
 Usually 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.570
 Where is the 1st and 3rd place 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.800
 We use for bank in place called the second from the top this time this time 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.490
 The distinctive thing is the 14th front 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.259
 Well then 2355 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.520
 We use for area 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 Low speed makes it more compact and also full length 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.580
 Then I put the width compactly 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.690
 I'm watching with Okama, where the vibration disappears at the hero 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 Tono: Of course it was a big deal 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 In that it becomes very narrow 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.140
 If you look at au v tea is v 29 people 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.670
 It is a customer when it comes to rice that I can just reschedule it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.860
 You can take your riding position freely 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 I have freedom in British design as an Eta car 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.800
 Very benefit for customers 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.450
 The best part for the customer 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 It's not sticky, it's not empty, and it's for the future 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.060
 Where can you run smoothly even sporty? 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.990
 Considering the system of air is now in why 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.010
 First of all, I want to make it as compact as possible 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 I chose to ignore it from laughing 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.579
 However, even though it still has rotation, it is smooth 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.600
 I want to put out a place close to the upper price for the original that I want to put 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.810
 There is a track record in the UK crf in that the gloss is smooth 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.459
 We adopted mixed system 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.189
 But another benefit is 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.659
 I am planning to escape 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.920
 The head becomes compact, especially when it increases dramatically 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:38.440
 I can do it 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.629
 That means before the engine is fully open 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.450
 For customers that receive yeah 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.729
 It was a riding position or a crown 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.069
 Well positioned 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.889
 I took motogp from 2005 to 2007 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.430
 I think just a spectroscope 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.110
 Last year Then it became 8004 when it became for games 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.950
 The year of 2007 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.959
 I did it for 3 years 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.619
 The basic layout of the engine lies earlier 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.419
 I talked to you, but it is said to make it compact 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.039
 It's a v-type and it's a place where you can spend a long break 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.219
 Put 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.920
 Eh I will do it. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.849
 It is the spirit who knows the traditional Honda part 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.049
 Also in the same way in the same lineage 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.029
 It is the first time in 8 and it is newly adopted 10-8 bw this time 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.340
 There is a Yano system when you feed 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.100
 This is too, but we keep using all the time 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.100
 In particular, it is not only to enhance its performance 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.279
 Eh this is how sporty to run and run smoothly 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:41.039
 If 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.739
 I control the place
