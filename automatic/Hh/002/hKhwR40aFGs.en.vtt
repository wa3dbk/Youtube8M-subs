you can also see grooves cut out in this
portion<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.140> turn<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> around

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
portion here and if we turn this around

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.149 
portion here and if we turn this around
and<00:02:02.399> use<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.630> format<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.890> see

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and use it in this format you can see

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
and use it in this format you can see
that<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.869> sort<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.740> stand

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that we can use this to sort of stand

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
that we can use this to sort of stand
the<00:02:08.190> iPad<00:02:08.580> up<00:02:08.759> into<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> grooves<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the iPad up into the grooves and then it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640 
the iPad up into the grooves and then it
will<00:02:11.009> stand<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.239> have

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
will stand up and you can have

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.240 
will stand up and you can have
lists<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:13.599> pull<00:02:14.599> sorry<00:02:15.079> horizontal<00:02:15.860> wall<00:02:16.040> at

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
lists of pull sorry horizontal wall at

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
lists of pull sorry horizontal wall at
landscape<00:02:16.939> mode<00:02:17.180> viewing<00:02:17.599> function<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
landscape mode viewing function so it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.199 
landscape mode viewing function so it
works<00:02:18.829> very<00:02:19.099> well<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:19.939> we<00:02:20.030> can

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
works very well for that and then we can

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.839 
works very well for that and then we can
angle<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.599> down<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> little<00:02:21.049> bit<00:02:21.230> further<00:02:21.439> and

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
angle it down a little bit further and

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.550 
angle it down a little bit further and
it<00:02:22.849> does<00:02:23.060> support<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.659> in<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> lower<00:02:24.019> angle<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it does support it in a lower angle and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.869 
it does support it in a lower angle and
then<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:24.860> angle<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.129> down<00:02:25.310> even<00:02:25.549> further

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
then we can angle it down even further

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.089 
then we can angle it down even further
and<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.810> will<00:02:26.930> actually<00:02:27.079> support<00:02:27.439> it<00:02:27.829> in<00:02:27.950> that

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
and it will actually support it in that

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.399 
and it will actually support it in that
lower<00:02:28.370> angle<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:29.030> well<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.140> sort<00:02:30.319> of

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
lower angle as well this is the sort of

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.960 
lower angle as well this is the sort of
angle<00:02:30.650> you're<00:02:30.920> getting<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:31.579> just<00:02:31.760> show<00:02:31.909> you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
angle you're getting for just show you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.809 
angle you're getting for just show you
side<00:02:32.359> on<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.170> we've<00:02:33.290> got<00:02:33.409> this<00:02:33.590> angle<00:02:34.040> we've

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
side on so we've got this angle we've

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.530 
side on so we've got this angle we've
got<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.500> angle<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.970> we've<00:02:38.120> got<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
got this angle and then we've got the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.949 
got this angle and then we've got the
more<00:02:39.049> upright<00:02:39.319> position<00:02:40.129> as<00:02:40.340> well<00:02:40.659> now<00:02:41.659> you'll
