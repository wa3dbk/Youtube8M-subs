sounds<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.560> maybe<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.799> few<00:01:42.950> bog<00:01:43.219> holes<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
sounds and maybe a few bog holes in that

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.889 
sounds and maybe a few bog holes in that
but<00:01:43.939> well<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.299> one<00:01:44.450> thing<00:01:44.659> with<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
but well it's the one thing with the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.050 
but well it's the one thing with the
sand<00:01:45.259> when<00:01:45.829> it's<00:01:45.979> wet<00:01:46.219> you<00:01:46.789> still<00:01:46.969> get

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
sand when it's wet you still get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.639 
sand when it's wet you still get
traction<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.719> you<00:01:47.810> change<00:01:48.079> your<00:01:48.170> lines<00:01:48.439> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
traction so you change your lines and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.919 
traction so you change your lines and
that's<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.920> we're<00:01:49.369> no<00:01:49.609> real<00:01:49.909> changes<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.719> the

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's it we're no real changes to the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.819 
that's it we're no real changes to the
to<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.799> bikes<00:01:52.130> maybe<00:01:52.369> some<00:01:53.649> harder<00:01:54.649> compound

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
to the bikes maybe some harder compound

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.149 
to the bikes maybe some harder compound
brake<00:01:55.280> pads<00:01:55.579> from<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.149> DP<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
only change we're gonna move to the bike

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.580 
only change we're gonna move to the bike
is<00:01:59.479> we're<00:01:59.600> going<00:01:59.689> to<00:01:59.780> go<00:01:59.869> ahead<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.170> wash<00:02:00.439> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590
