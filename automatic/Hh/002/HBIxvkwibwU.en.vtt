00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.009
Our tomatoes, corn - the garden is looking
really good.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.150
We've got it split up with our new garden
design.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.080
We're real tickled about how that has turned
out.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.220
I want to talk to you today about cover crops.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.200
Because when we laid off our new garden, we
had two or three plots that we didn't plant.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.570
And now we may come back here in another month
and plant sweet potatoes in the middle of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.170
June, or we may get a fancy to plant some
pumpkins.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.500
If we do that, then we'll have these plots
to do that in.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.739
But for the time being, we're going to let
them lay and we're going to plant a cover

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.739
crop.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.800
Now the idea behind a cover crop is it keeps
something growing on your soil at all times

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.890
which is definitely something you want to
consider.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.769
You don't want your plots or your garden to
lay out with bare soil.

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.020
Always keep something growing on it.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.149
And what the cover crops do is they add biomass.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.420
Some of them are legumes and they put nitrogen
back into your soil.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.969
They offer a lot of organic matter.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.719
Some of them offer nematode suppression.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.620
Now the one that I'm planting here today is
brown top millet which is fairly inexpensive.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.549
Now the great thing about brown top millet
and your other cover crops is they grow really

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.549
fast.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.549
So when you're choosing a cover crop, you
want one that grows faster than the weeds

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.549
do.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.770
Because we have a terrible time here with
pigweed.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.729
So I've got to have something that's going
to grow faster than pigweed.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.729
And brown top millet fits the bill.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.770
It's relatively inexpensive and it's easy
to plant.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.479
Now there are some hybrids out there that
you can plant, but for a cover crop, the cheap

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.259
brown top variety is fine.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.110
Another variety or another cover crop that
you can plant in the summertime is sun hemp.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.030
And I used it last summer and it works great.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.740
Buckwheat also works great.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.820
Now these three cover crops I mentioned work
great here in the southeast United States.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.829
When you get into other areas, I'm not sure
how well they would perform.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.600
But I know they do well here.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.469
They key to them is not letting them seed
out.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.729
So once they get to a pretty good size, before
they start putting that seed head on there,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.730
you want to cut them down, till them, and
get them back in your soil so they can start

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.730
breaking down, feeding your microbes, and
doing their thing.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.740
If you let them go to seed, then you could
possibly have some weed problems with that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.920
variety later on.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.300
Now planting brown top millet, I'm going to
show you what I used here and the plate that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.940
I used to seed it with.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.020
I took a #1 plate and I drilled it out.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.440
Now I wanted a little closer spacing for the
brown top millet and this spacing here is

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830
about 2 1/8", somewhere in there.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.250
Now there's a little indention on this #1
plate that you can drill out there and get

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.810
your spacing closer.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.670
And I think we ended up with about 1" to a
little over 1" spacing with this plate here.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.180
So I took my brown top millet and I made sure
that hole size was right and I drilled them

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.180
out.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.952
And then these other holes I reamed out a
little bit more.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:04.840
So I ended up with this plate here and it
works great.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.890
Alright here's the millet seed right here.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.100
And I always take a few seed -- test them.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.640
Make sure they fit through the hole fine.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:33.410
So I'll put this plate in, I'll catch the
little D part inside the seed plate.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.120
Now this brush, you just want to keep it snug,
right there.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.980
The brush keeps the excess seed wiped off
from this plate, but it also serves another

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.970
purpose because it helps hold down that seed
plate with constant pressure on the front

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:05.970
and back.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:36.310
Alright, you see it coming up right there.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.310
There's the millet.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.400
I planted this about a week or so ago.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.860
We haven't had any rain so I did water it
one time, got it coming up.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.210
I won't spend a lot of time watering or fertilizing
it because it is a cover crop.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.580
I don't want to put a lot of money or time
or effort into it.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.070
so there it is there.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.420
It will grow really quick, hopefully a lot
quicker than the weeds do, and we'll cut it

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.420
in.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:06.570
In the winter time we use rye, we use oats,
we use a lot of clover -- I like the white,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.150
with the red crimson probably being my favorite
with clovers.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.220
We use those for cover crops.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.600
In the summertime the primary ones we use
are buckwheat, sun hemp, and then brown top

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600
millet.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600
So there you have it.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.290
Plant cover crops, always keep something growing
on your garden.
