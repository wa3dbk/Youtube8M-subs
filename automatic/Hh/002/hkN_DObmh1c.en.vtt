okay<00:00:22.449> everyone<00:00:22.660> last<00:00:23.109> class<00:00:23.500> we<00:00:24.429> worked<00:00:24.699> on

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
okay everyone last class we worked on

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.900 
okay everyone last class we worked on
sequential<00:00:25.599> programming<00:00:26.320> using<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.369> robot

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:38.220 
sequential programming using the robot
in<00:00:28.149> motion<00:00:36.570> today<00:00:37.570> what<00:00:37.839> we're<00:00:37.960> going<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.110> be

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
in motion today what we're going to be

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.660 
in motion today what we're going to be
doing<00:00:38.470> is<00:00:38.800> building<00:00:39.040> on<00:00:39.250> what<00:00:39.399> we<00:00:39.519> did

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
doing is building on what we did

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.990 
doing is building on what we did
yesterday<00:00:40.050> by<00:00:41.050> adding<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:42.000> ultrasonic

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
yesterday by adding the ultrasonic

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.930 
yesterday by adding the ultrasonic
sensor<00:00:43.570> when<00:00:44.409> you<00:00:44.680> start<00:00:45.159> programming<00:00:45.699> your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
sensor when you start programming your

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.030 
sensor when you start programming your
robot<00:00:46.329> your<00:00:46.899> robot<00:00:47.229> will<00:00:47.409> react<00:00:47.769> or

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
robot your robot will react or

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.530 
robot your robot will react or
intelligent<00:00:48.610> link<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.030> environment

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
intelligent link to the environment

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.110 
intelligent link to the environment
around<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.340> you're<00:00:51.489> going<00:00:51.609> to<00:00:51.670> attach<00:00:51.910> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
around it and you're going to attach the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.619 
around it and you're going to attach the
ultrasonic<00:00:52.750> sensor<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:55.149> I<00:00:55.179> like<00:00:55.449> about

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
ultrasonic sensor what I like about

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.380 
ultrasonic sensor what I like about
using<00:00:56.170> eb-3<00:00:56.829> in<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> classroom<00:00:57.519> is<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:58.059> it's

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
using eb-3 in the classroom is that it's

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.479 
using eb-3 in the classroom is that it's
kind<00:00:59.109> of<00:00:59.140> like<00:00:59.320> instant<00:00:59.800> engagement<00:00:59.890> or

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
kind of like instant engagement or

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.549 
kind of like instant engagement or
engagement<00:01:00.789> in<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.149> box<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.690> can<00:01:01.809> introduce<00:01:02.230> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
engagement in a box I can introduce the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.770 
engagement in a box I can introduce the
lesson<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:03.100> beyond<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.730> students<00:01:04.179> can

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
lesson but beyond that the students can

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.570 
lesson but beyond that the students can
work<00:01:04.929> very<00:01:04.989> much<00:01:05.259> on<00:01:05.560> their<00:01:05.710> own<00:01:05.740> is<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:06.460> the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
work very much on their own is that the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.490 
work very much on their own is that the
right<00:01:06.700> one<00:01:06.990> yeah<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.140> is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
right one yeah it is

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.840 
right one yeah it is
so<00:01:08.770> you're<00:01:08.920> going<00:01:09.130> backwards<00:01:09.550> instead<00:01:09.700> of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
so you're going backwards instead of

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
so you're going backwards instead of
forwards<00:01:09.940> it's<00:01:10.539> not<00:01:10.720> going<00:01:10.929> forward<00:01:11.200> here

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
forwards it's not going forward here

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.969 
forwards it's not going forward here
economic<00:01:13.000> need<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:13.960> recalibrate<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.649> -<00:01:14.800> that

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
economic need to recalibrate it - that

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.969 
economic need to recalibrate it - that
is<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.909> up<00:01:16.030> position<00:01:16.509> is<00:01:16.630> zero<00:01:16.840> I'm<00:01:17.649> good

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
is so the up position is zero I'm good

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.260 
is so the up position is zero I'm good
yeah

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.050 

yes<00:01:24.270> Eve<00:01:25.050> III<00:01:25.530> makes<00:01:25.830> learning<00:01:25.980> easier<00:01:26.370> for<00:01:26.940> me

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
because it's really easy to follow

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.220 
because it's really easy to follow
you're<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.270> building<00:01:30.480> what<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.050> want

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
you're actually building what you want

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're actually building what you want
to<00:01:31.320> build<00:01:31.530> hands<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to build hands on and you get a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.180 
to build hands on and you get a
immediately<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> results<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.100> your

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
immediately see the results of your

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.530 
immediately see the results of your
project<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> real<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:41.090> what<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.120> like<00:01:42.390> about

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
project in real time what I like about

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.560 
project in real time what I like about
the<00:01:42.840> ev3<00:01:43.229> curriculum<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.340> teachers<00:01:45.300> can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the ev3 curriculum is that teachers can

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
the ev3 curriculum is that teachers can
open<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.620> right<00:01:46.770> away<00:01:46.830> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
open it up and use it right away and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.210 
open it up and use it right away and
know<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.120> addresses<00:01:48.900> math<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.830> science

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
know that it addresses math and science

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
tool for teaching the 21st century
skills<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.009> definitely<00:01:56.490> getting<00:01:56.610> them

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
skills so it is definitely getting them

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.600 
skills so it is definitely getting them
prepared<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> future<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:02.220> today<00:02:02.460> we're

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
prepared for the future so today we're

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.940 
prepared for the future so today we're
going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> explore<00:02:03.180> its<00:02:03.300> recent<00:02:03.630> areas<00:02:03.950> we're

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
going to explore its recent areas we're

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.170 
going to explore its recent areas we're
going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> explore<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.550> temperature<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
going to explore the temperature of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.600 
going to explore the temperature of
water<00:02:06.420> coming<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.410> tap<00:02:07.680> we're<00:02:08.520> gonna

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
water coming out of tap we're gonna

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
water coming out of tap we're gonna
explore<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.910> temperature<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> water<00:02:09.509> with

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
explore the temperature of water with

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.410 
explore the temperature of water with
ice<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:11.850> finally<00:02:12.270> we're<00:02:12.390> going

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
ice in it and then finally we're going

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300 
ice in it and then finally we're going
to<00:02:12.540> explore<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> temperature<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.680> water<00:02:13.890> if

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to explore the temperature of water if

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.229 
to explore the temperature of water if
I've<00:02:15.030> added<00:02:15.360> some<00:02:15.780> salt<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.220> ice<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.090> we

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
I've added some salt to the ice so we

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.360 
I've added some salt to the ice so we
want<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.570> guys<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> use<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.709> software<00:02:20.130> tool

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
want you guys to use the software tool

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.220 
want you guys to use the software tool
to<00:02:20.700> predict<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.330> they're<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> analyze

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
to predict and they're going to analyze

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.550 
to predict and they're going to analyze
to<00:02:22.260> compare<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.459> close<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.060> prediction

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
to compare how close was your prediction

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.430 
to compare how close was your prediction
okay<00:02:27.890> when<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.070> use<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.519> data<00:02:30.060> logging<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:31.170> can

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
okay when we use the data logging we can

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
okay when we use the data logging we can
collect<00:02:31.769> data<00:02:31.799> at<00:02:32.190> five<00:02:32.459> samples<00:02:32.970> per<00:02:33.090> second

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
collect data at five samples per second

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
collect data at five samples per second
you<00:02:33.900> can't<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.799> a<00:02:34.830> regular

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you can't do that with a regular

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490

easy one of the key aspects of the ev3

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.879 
easy one of the key aspects of the ev3
is<00:03:45.700> students<00:03:46.569> are<00:03:46.659> excited<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.079> use<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.560> we

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
is students are excited to use it and we

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.440 
is students are excited to use it and we
know<00:03:48.069> when<00:03:48.370> students<00:03:48.790> are<00:03:48.909> excited<00:03:49.209> about
