00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
bracelet and then these ones are for my

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.490 
bracelet and then these ones are for my
most<00:03:11.310> recent<00:03:11.549> bracelet<00:03:12.269> tutorial<00:03:12.420> with<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
most recent bracelet tutorial with the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.270 
most recent bracelet tutorial with the
wire<00:03:13.829> words<00:03:14.579> like<00:03:15.060> dream<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> also

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
wire words like dream and then I also

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.879 
wire words like dream and then I also
keep<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.879> little<00:03:18.180> chain<00:03:18.569> sections<00:03:19.169> in<00:03:19.440> here

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
keep the little chain sections in here

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.990 
keep the little chain sections in here
because<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.129> waste<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.669> make<00:03:23.819> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
because I think it's a waste to make the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.629 
because I think it's a waste to make the
chain<00:03:24.269> part<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.959> every<00:03:25.260> single<00:03:25.530> bracelet<00:03:26.099> so

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
chain part for every single bracelet so

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.640 
chain part for every single bracelet so
I<00:03:26.669> just<00:03:27.030> make<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.230> switch<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
I just make one and then I can switch it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.379 
I just make one and then I can switch it
up<00:03:28.769> depending<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.400> whether<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.730> want<00:03:29.940> like<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
up depending on whether I want like this

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.569 
up depending on whether I want like this
