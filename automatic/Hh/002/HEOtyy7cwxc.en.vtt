were to breed the metal with plant you

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.180 
were to breed the metal with plant you
would<00:00:52.629> most<00:00:52.960> likely<00:00:53.289> get<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.530> venom<00:00:53.680> dragon

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190

let's click out of here

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.169 
let's click out of here
so<00:00:59.859> you'll<00:01:00.010> see<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.370> I<00:01:00.429> have<00:01:00.519> him<00:01:00.789> in<00:01:00.910> for<00:01:01.059> 9

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
so you'll see that I have him in for 9

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.000 
so you'll see that I have him in for 9
hours<00:01:01.480> now<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.719> have<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.079> VIP<00:01:02.350> on<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.859> bought

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
hours now I do have the VIP on I bought

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.540 
hours now I do have the VIP on I bought
some<00:01:03.219> gems<00:01:03.460> yesterday<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.920> probably

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
some gems yesterday so it's probably

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.889 
some gems yesterday so it's probably
going<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.700> take<00:01:06.789> a<00:01:06.940> longer<00:01:07.330> time<00:01:07.360> for<00:01:07.780> him<00:01:07.869> to

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
going to take a longer time for him to

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to take a longer time for him to
hatch<00:01:08.140> than<00:01:08.560> me<00:01:08.770> because<00:01:09.070> from<00:01:09.700> what<00:01:09.820> I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
hatch than me because from what I

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.029 
hatch than me because from what I
understand<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.330> VIP<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.840> got<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.619> takes

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
understand the VIP that I got it takes

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.859 
understand the VIP that I got it takes
off<00:01:12.190> like<00:01:12.369> 20%<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:13.119> reading<00:01:13.420> time<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.750> you'd

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
off like 20% of reading time that you'd

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.410 
off like 20% of reading time that you'd
have<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.080> wait<00:01:14.229> for<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:15.310> it's<00:01:15.850> probably<00:01:16.179> longer

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
have to wait for so it's probably longer

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.779 
have to wait for so it's probably longer
than<00:01:16.570> this<00:01:16.840> but<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:17.229> me<00:01:17.289> it's<00:01:17.679> 9<00:01:17.950> hours<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.670> I

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
than this but for me it's 9 hours and I

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.310 
than this but for me it's 9 hours and I
had<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.149> IP<00:01:19.270> thing<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.080> says

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
had to be IP thing on so that says

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
had to be IP thing on so that says
something<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.550> I<00:01:21.580> did<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.060> breed<00:01:22.270> him<00:01:22.539> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
something and what I did to breed him is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.089 
something and what I did to breed him is
I<00:01:23.860> bred<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:25.140> plant<00:01:26.140> dragon<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.500> armor

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:30.099 
I bred the plant dragon with the armor

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.529 
I bred the plant dragon with the armor
dragon<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.869> bred<00:01:31.869> those<00:01:32.110> two<00:01:32.410> together<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:33.539> get

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
dragon I bred those two together to get

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.309 
dragon I bred those two together to get
the<00:01:34.869> cyborg<00:01:35.319> dragon<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:37.959> breed<00:01:38.200> the

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
the cyborg dragon and if you breed the

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.900 
the cyborg dragon and if you breed the
plant<00:01:38.590> dragon<00:01:39.009> directly<00:01:39.489> with<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.759> metal

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
plant dragon directly with the metal

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.210 
plant dragon directly with the metal
dragon<00:01:40.509> I'm<00:01:40.860> guessing<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:41.979> there's<00:01:42.160> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
dragon I'm guessing that there's a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.010 
dragon I'm guessing that there's a
chance<00:01:42.489> you<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:42.759> get<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.060> but<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.780> most

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
chance you can get it but you most

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.589 
chance you can get it but you most
likely<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.619> venom<00:01:44.800> dragon<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:46.149> that's

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
likely get the venom dragon so that's

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.320 
likely get the venom dragon so that's
how<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.810> breed<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.739> cyborg<00:01:48.640> dragon<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.209> I'm

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
how you breed the cyborg dragon and I'm

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.150 
how you breed the cyborg dragon and I'm
going<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.539> hatch<00:01:49.750> my<00:01:50.020> a-game<00:01:50.170> there<00:01:50.800> he<00:01:50.950> is

spending my gems on the tribal but since

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.240 
spending my gems on the tribal but since
you<00:03:45.109> guys<00:03:45.230> said<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.799> was<00:03:45.889> really<00:03:46.040> easy

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
you guys said that it was really easy

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.500 
you guys said that it was really easy
for<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.609> to<00:03:46.700> get<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.090> know<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.359> just

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
for you to get it you know if you just

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.319 
for you to get it you know if you just
breed<00:03:47.720> for<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.079> then<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.609> think<00:03:49.730> I'll<00:03:50.030> take<00:03:50.180> my

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
breed for it then I I think I'll take my

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.789 
breed for it then I I think I'll take my
chances<00:03:50.720> with<00:03:50.780> him<00:03:51.079> cuz<00:03:51.350> he's<00:03:51.500> one<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
chances with him cuz he's one of the

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.140 
chances with him cuz he's one of the
earlier<00:03:52.069> dragons<00:03:52.489> which<00:03:52.639> shouldn't<00:03:52.819> be<00:03:52.880> that

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
earlier dragons which shouldn't be that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.750 
earlier dragons which shouldn't be that
hard<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.450> get<00:03:53.630> him<00:03:53.859> but<00:03:54.859> anyways<00:03:55.160> that's

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
hard to get him but anyways that's

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.520 
hard to get him but anyways that's
that's<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:57.019> have<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.200> little<00:03:57.290> bit<00:03:57.470> of
