00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
shadow to blend it in I can now use a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.440 
shadow to blend it in I can now use a
very<00:01:36.100> dark<00:01:36.369> green<00:01:36.670> color<00:01:37.029> here<00:01:37.119> on<00:01:37.359> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
very dark green color here on the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.090 
very dark green color here on the
outside<00:01:37.779> corner<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.170> eye<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.799> filmed

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
outside corner of the eye and I filmed

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.410 
outside corner of the eye and I filmed
two<00:01:39.249> versions<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.759> this<00:01:39.939> one<00:01:40.149> that's<00:01:40.359> very

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
two versions of this one that's very

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.019 
two versions of this one that's very
very<00:01:40.869> bright<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:42.279> one<00:01:42.490> which<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.819> much

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
very bright and this one which is much

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.209 
very bright and this one which is much
darker<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.319> I<00:01:44.469> thought<00:01:44.619> we'd<00:01:44.799> go<00:01:44.920> with<00:01:44.950> this

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
darker and I thought we'd go with this
