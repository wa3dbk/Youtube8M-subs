00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the comment section below a guy told me

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.780 
the comment section below a guy told me
to<00:00:09.690> explain<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.050> more<00:00:10.230> briefly<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> looked

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
to explain it more briefly so I looked

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.700 
to explain it more briefly so I looked
up<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:11.969> videos<00:00:12.240> found<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.139> perfectly

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
up some videos found out to do perfectly

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.160 
up some videos found out to do perfectly
so<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.790> cancel<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.450> when<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
so I really cancel is when you do a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680 
so I really cancel is when you do a
combo<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.890> when<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> hit<00:00:17.880> makes<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.510> enemy

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
combo and when the hit makes the enemy

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.740 
combo and when the hit makes the enemy
stagger<00:00:19.109> your<00:00:19.470> whole<00:00:19.980> circle<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.090> then

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
stagger your whole circle or be and then

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.710 
stagger your whole circle or be and then
you<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:21.990> team<00:00:22.609> attack<00:00:23.609> now<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.570> do

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

really<00:00:41.550> easy<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.480> want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> make<00:00:42.989> sure

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
really easy you just want to make sure

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
really easy you just want to make sure
you<00:00:43.320> pick<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> character<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.090> make<00:00:45.390> your

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you pick a character that can make your

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
you pick a character that can make your
enemy<00:00:46.020> stagger<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> hits

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
enemy stagger by one of the hits

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
enemy stagger by one of the hits
I<00:00:47.550> picked<00:00:47.850> Minato<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.480> Minato<00:00:48.780> pretty<00:00:49.140> much

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I picked Minato as Minato pretty much

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.029 
I picked Minato as Minato pretty much
all<00:00:50.160> his<00:00:50.550> combos<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.690> perfect<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.500> combo

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
all his combos are perfect for combo

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
all his combos are perfect for combo
consoles<00:00:53.520> relays<00:00:54.510> everything<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
consoles relays everything so I think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.709 
consoles relays everything so I think
Minato<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> quickest<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.149> easiest<00:00:57.360> one

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
Minato is the quickest and easiest one

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.689 
Minato is the quickest and easiest one
to<00:00:57.750> use<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.010> showed<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> some<00:00:59.489> more

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to use I could have showed you some more

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
to use I could have showed you some more
but<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> stopped<00:01:00.480> monado's<00:01:00.960> aunty<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.890> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
but I stopped monado's aunty see it with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
but I stopped monado's aunty see it with
Minato<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> three-hit<00:01:03.719> combo<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.409> any

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
Minato is a three-hit combo in any

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.149 
Minato is a three-hit combo in any
direction<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.360> hold<00:01:06.720> B<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.260> o<00:01:07.290> right

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
direction and you just hold B or o right

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.330 
direction and you just hold B or o right
after<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.030> click<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.930> B<00:01:10.380> three<00:01:11.070> times

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
after it so you click over B three times

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
after it so you click over B three times
then<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> hold<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> fourth<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.780> then

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
then you hold it on the fourth time then

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
then you hold it on the fourth time then
it<00:01:13.860> should<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> enemy<00:01:14.790> stagger<00:01:15.560> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it should make the enemy stagger just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.649 
it should make the enemy stagger just
like<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.490> should<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.090> ultimate

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
like a and then you should just ultimate

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260 
like a and then you should just ultimate
right<00:01:19.020> after<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> enemy<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.119> be

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right after so the enemy will not be

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
right after so the enemy will not be
able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> block<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.500> keep<00:01:22.680> watching

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
able to block this just keep watching

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.039 
able to block this just keep watching
keep<00:01:23.340> trying<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> difficult<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
keep trying it's not that difficult you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.160 
keep trying it's not that difficult you
should<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.560> after<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.860> few<00:01:25.979> tries<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
should get it after a few tries so just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.420 
should get it after a few tries so just
keep<00:01:28.290> looking<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.799> some<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.159> videos

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
keep looking up some of these videos

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
keep looking up some of these videos
it's<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.290> simple

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it's really really simple

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
it's really really simple
I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.270> easier<00:01:33.630> than<00:01:33.659> combo

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I think it's much easier than combo

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
I think it's much easier than combo
councils<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> idea<00:01:36.180> is
