yeah there's semi likely to come into
room<00:00:24.240> 14<00:00:24.720> because<00:00:25.140> if<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> weather<00:00:26.220> comes

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
they have to come and there's a chance

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.029 
they have to come and there's a chance
they'll<00:00:28.170> put<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.500> without<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.890> liver

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039

weather by you know gathering the skulls
for<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.759> next<00:00:33.059> update<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> imagine

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
for the next update that's how I imagine

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.959 
for the next update that's how I imagine
they're<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.010> things<00:00:35.250> again<00:00:35.760> that's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.670 
they're going to do things again that's
just<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.300> imagination<00:00:36.450> though<00:00:37.050> they're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
just my imagination though they're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.319 
just my imagination though they're
definitely<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.100> confirmed<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.790> any<00:00:38.910> way<00:00:39.120> but

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
definitely not confirmed in any way but

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.549 
definitely not confirmed in any way but
it's<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.780> definitely<00:00:40.050> worth<00:00:40.350> knowing

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's you know definitely worth knowing

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
it's you know definitely worth knowing
just<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> case<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> game<00:00:42.090> so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
just in case they are in the game so

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
just in case they are in the game so
yeah<00:00:43.020> where<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.260> skeletons<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.340> way

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
yeah where the skeletons are the one way

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
yeah where the skeletons are the one way
to<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> wither<00:00:44.940> skull<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to get the wither skull which is of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.330 
to get the wither skull which is of
course<00:00:46.020> needed<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> create<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> river<00:00:47.100> if

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
course needed to create the river if

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
course needed to create the river if
you're<00:00:47.520> familiar<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> river<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.360> which<00:00:49.140> is

you're familiar of the river to which is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
you're familiar of the river to which is
the<00:00:49.440> hardest<00:00:50.010> hardest<00:00:50.309> mobile<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> game

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
you have to do is go into a dark part
for<00:01:12.960> fortress<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> find

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
for fortress and you can you know find

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
for fortress and you can you know find
one<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:15.030> things<00:01:15.560> unfortunately<00:01:16.560> yes<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
one of these things unfortunately yes I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
one of these things unfortunately yes I
said<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.460> blazes<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
said that's where blazes are so you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.520 
said that's where blazes are so you
really<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.900> careful<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.320> them

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
really have to be careful about them

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.899 
really have to be careful about them
because<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.369> deadly<00:01:20.610> enough<00:01:20.729> by

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
because these are deadly enough by

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
because these are deadly enough by
themselves<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.600> hard<00:01:21.960> mode<00:01:22.049> they'll<00:01:22.409> take<00:01:22.590> two

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
themselves in hard mode they'll take two

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
which is a really really deadly

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.770 
which is a really really deadly
combination<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.360> this<00:03:06.450> anywhere

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
combination so don't do this anywhere

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.080 
combination so don't do this anywhere
near<00:03:06.989> edges<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.410> anything<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.430> also<00:03:08.640> smoking

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
near edges or anything and also smoking

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.789 
near edges or anything and also smoking
them<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> possibility<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.620> can

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
them is a possibility because you can

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.410 
them is a possibility because you can
actually<00:03:10.829> just<00:03:11.280> take<00:03:11.489> them<00:03:11.670> down<00:03:11.849> entirely
