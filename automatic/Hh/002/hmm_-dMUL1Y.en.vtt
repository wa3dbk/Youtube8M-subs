00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
 as the official stand already has more 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.640
 people and go 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.400
 still there are still people in the 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.930
 official platform but I wanted to tell you 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.330
 something jaime when we always see the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.880
 president of the republic that is 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.710
 surrounded by men and women who 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.169
 they provide security, they do not ask 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.589
 what kind of training do they have how 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.480
 make the choice and how difficult it is 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.119
 that work because you imagine taking care of 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.669
 president of the republic you have to have 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
 eyes everywhere commander how 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.839
 they are very good morning 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 part of the team in charge of 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.470
 security of the first lady and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 president of the republic and of 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.339
 International dignitaries are personal 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.960
 selected that works at the address 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.309
 of state security and that have been 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.199
 the safety and protection course 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.659
 people laws for two months that is 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.429
 a course of field nothing else where what 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.019
 teaches shooting technique and more than 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.910
 all the technique and realism that the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.519
 protection of the dignitary have a 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.109
 different training so this is a 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.289
 different training because because 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.640
 they care for high- ranking dignitaries like 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.770
 is the president of the republic of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 Peru and international dignitaries as 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.259
 has been the Pacific alliance where 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.970
 we had the visit of four 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.430
 presidents and have therefore had the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.710
 personal memory of each of them 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 I am a commander and I understand the seriousness 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.090
 from his work came opportunities by 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.070
 example the press wants to approach the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.710
 president the republic they meet 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.680
 with your work but a question always 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.180
 they are that serious with the seriousness and the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.070
 concentration of life to be able to take care 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 good retail are concentrated 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.000
 concentrated concentrates hire 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.850
 suddenly and they greet the happy camera 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.010
 28 or no, no, there 's a pluck 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.330
 smile 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.590
 they are smiling I can not because I'm 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.119
 attentive when its humanitarian is 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.100
 responsibility for that have been 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.180
 Clear clear preparations is a great 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.180
 responsibility 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.040
 Ivan suddenly some of them could 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.960
 with your mobile in these times so 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.259
 difficult where crime has 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.180
 increased and it's so easy to do 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.270
 attacks as we have already seen in a 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.979
 circus for example now the agents of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.319
 state security have to have 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.450
 eyes and ears everywhere 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.999
 it's right they have to be very 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.180
 Attentive to all remember if not bad 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:18.700
 I remember last year right here in the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 parade or the year before that a 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.560
 person leaves the rostrum and tries to 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.180
 approach the recent the republica what 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 it was what happened in our function 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.090
 well, try to avoid being 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.370
 accept the president of the republic his 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 investiture as president and there is the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.659
 security personnel or to take care of it and 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.629
 protect it how this situation is handled 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.840
 is handled by rings is handled by 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.269
 security levels 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
 they are chosen in what way by a 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.790
 security confidence issue of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 training mainly and most 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.000
 important is the training they have to 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.680
 have the course of dignitary protection 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.690
 which is done for two months that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 they practice in the field what is the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.890
 different the different techniques of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.830
 clever either knee kicked standing 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.690
 to protect food 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.240
 and they are with the full team they are with 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.330
 the perfect complete team I think that 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.910
 have we can see some of the equipment 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.660
 we can show this is a team 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.150
 complete containing the catherine holder 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.770
 It also has a holster holder 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.910
 with 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.910
 in millimeters sorry 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.870
 if a kid there we go explain me 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.140
 day of a weapon 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.130
 of 9 mm cuts catches by 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.220
 favor 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.950
 we have the way to retractable tickets 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.330
 which are instruments or tools that 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.970
 help us to professions of subject in 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.660
 any situation and communications 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.670
 also and communications too 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.010
 we sell the humphrey to communicate 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.770
 per inmate for any news or 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 requirement that we have to see if the 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.250
 camera helps me sometimes we have to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.740
 example that is security and of 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.420
 suddenly I have the same room and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.830
 suddenly we are taking care of part 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.780
 of the republic let's say of the agents 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.390
 that the starting hand gets 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.890
 converse with who they are receiving 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.060
 short information with which 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.250
 discount that he is giving you the guidelines 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 for the protection of the inat area where 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.280
 we can prevent any 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.250
 action that attempts against the personality 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.690
 perfect the last question they leave 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.010
 to order security today 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.620
 president the regulated and that already we 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.350
 We'll take care of it and can you tell me 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.580
 volunteer in a space to be able 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.909
 interview in a little while 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.349
 as they are already looking at me badly 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.789
 been looking at the main thing the 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.030
 protection of all people who 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.030
 they have 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.469
 very interesting
