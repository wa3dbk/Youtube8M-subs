00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.590 
and hard I posted a video or earlier
this<00:00:34.260> week<00:00:34.530> stating<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.329> want<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this week stating that if you want to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.869 
this week stating that if you want to
increase<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.430> chances<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.489> getting<00:00:38.790> an

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
increase the chances of getting an

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
increase the chances of getting an
exotic<00:00:39.390> sets<00:00:39.660> exactly<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> best<00:00:40.680> thing<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> do

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
exotic sets exactly the best thing to do

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
exotic sets exactly the best thing to do
is<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> raid<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.850> normal<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.440> do

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is do the raid on normal first then do

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.040 
is do the raid on normal first then do
it<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.920> hard<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.180> valances

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it on hard because you get more valances

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
it on hard because you get more valances
because<00:00:46.289> each<00:00:46.500> time<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.039> open<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> vault<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
because each time you open the vault of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260 
because each time you open the vault of
glass<00:00:48.030> chest<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.460> Theon<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.000> crota

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
glass chest and you be a Theon or crota

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.619 
glass chest and you be a Theon or crota
you<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.170> exotic<00:00:52.590> chance<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.120> best<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you get an exotic chance so it's best to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.569 
you get an exotic chance so it's best to
go<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.230> normal<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> hard

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
go do it on normal then do it on hard

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
go do it on normal then do it on hard
therefore<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.239> increasing<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.140> chance<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
therefore it's increasing your chance of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770 
therefore it's increasing your chance of
getting<00:00:58.649> exotic<00:00:59.280> weapons<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.629> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
getting exotic weapons now if you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
getting exotic weapons now if you're
going<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.170> anything<00:01:01.440> else<00:01:01.770> whether<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
going for anything else whether the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
going for anything else whether the
radar<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.780> raid<00:01:04.019> gear<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.949> don't

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
radar more raid gear and I don't

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.300 
radar more raid gear and I don't
recommend<00:01:05.460> doing<00:01:05.760> normal<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> hard

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
recommend doing normal first and hard

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
recommend doing normal first and hard
however<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.780> exotic

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
however if you are just going for exotic

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
however if you are just going for exotic
weapons<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.369> best<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.240> about

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
weapons this is the best way to go about

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
weapons this is the best way to go about
doing<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.890> able<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
doing it this is how I was able to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
doing it this is how I was able to
obtain<00:01:14.549> every<00:01:15.240> single<00:01:15.600> exotic<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.830> only

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
obtain every single exotic and not only

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
obtain every single exotic and not only
just<00:01:17.280> obtained<00:01:17.700> every<00:01:18.270> single<00:01:18.540> exotic<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
just obtained every single exotic but I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.249 
just obtained every single exotic but I
don't<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.430> any<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.790> exotics<00:01:21.270> any<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
don't even want any more exotics any and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
don't even want any more exotics any and
every<00:01:22.560> exotic<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.430> until<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.909> new

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
every exotic I get until the new

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
every exotic I get until the new
expansion<00:01:25.020> comes<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.939> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
expansion comes out is just going to be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.149 
expansion comes out is just going to be
broken<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
broken down because I have all the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
broken down because I have all the
duplicates<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> characters<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
duplicates I want all the characters and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.420 
duplicates I want all the characters and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and I was able to do it using this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890

method and I promise you that it does

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.289 
method and I promise you that it does

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.130 
a Theon also i will try when I go and do
a<00:01:46.020> Theon<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> chests<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.899> anyone<00:01:48.899> gets

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
a Theon and do the chests if anyone gets

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
a Theon and do the chests if anyone gets
an<00:01:49.350> exotic<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.070> record<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
an exotic I will record it and then if

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
an exotic I will record it and then if
we<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> again<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.350> hard<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:52.950> record<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
we do it again on hard i will record it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
we do it again on hard i will record it
but<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.240> easy<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.840> record<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.829> both

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
but it's not easy to record for both

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.600 
but it's not easy to record for both
runs<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.149> i'm<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.579> my

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
runs and i'm not going to go out of my

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
runs and i'm not going to go out of my
way<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.119> try<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:00.899> here's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
way and try and get it because here's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.709 
way and try and get it because here's
the<00:02:01.439> proof<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.369> came<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the proof that it came you can do it and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.449 
the proof that it came you can do it and
I've<00:02:04.140> had<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:05.460> raid<00:02:06.030> members<00:02:06.450> getting<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.560> new

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
I've had a raid members getting a new

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
I've had a raid members getting a new
exotic<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.060> normal<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> chest<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
exotic on normal out of the chest and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
exotic on normal out of the chest and
getting<00:02:10.379> exotic<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.009> hard<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
getting exotic out of hard and then I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.690 
getting exotic out of hard and then I
hey<00:02:12.150> I've<00:02:12.480> gotten<00:02:12.840> double<00:02:13.140> exotics<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
hey I've gotten double exotics all of a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.740 
hey I've gotten double exotics all of a
Theon<00:02:14.970> doing<00:02:15.270> normal<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:15.990> hard<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.750> it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
Theon doing normal and then hard so it's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.150 
Theon doing normal and then hard so it's
definitely<00:02:19.170> possible<00:02:19.410> when<00:02:19.800> here's<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
definitely possible when here's the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580 
definitely possible when here's the
proof<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.700> hope<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> enjoyed<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.050> video<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
proof I hope you enjoyed this video and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.030 
proof I hope you enjoyed this video and
may<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.130> success<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> do
