00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.390
 And then I'll go there right then and there I 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm going to teach you the surf bug in 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.009
 that if you are caught by a tutor 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 Twin adm can bento not a ban 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.140
 for example so you go in that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.130
 I returned that harvest from that pond. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 on the side of cp is the most efficient you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.890
 use a pokémon to get any and from here 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.470
 where are you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.470
 this one turned its advisors here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 I wait a little and it is very likely that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 bug ready you're talking on the ground 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 watch out as I said gm adm tutor 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.449
 It can give you a nice bath but for you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 It's just you surfing again and you're done. 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 also the most common bug to do 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.879
 is to walk on the water but that makes you 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.369
 back to your original city, my 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.810
 crop for example 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.810
 let's try again 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.140
 right 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.869
 the pboc the pokémon that more are using 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.759
 for that was on earth the charm stark 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.080
 for example I can use either 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:32.210
 You can also, for example, we can 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:36.680
 to use ones in the lecs or any other that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.220
 Do you want everyone surfing bubu galera? 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.670
 Thank you and tomorrow, teach you the best way. 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.860
 easy to pick wins the most efficient and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.240
 perhaps it shows me answers art 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.229
 free 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.229
