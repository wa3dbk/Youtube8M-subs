back let's push forward with this and
give<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.300> try<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.770> think<00:02:07.190> for<00:02:07.370> us<00:02:07.550> we<00:02:07.910> we've

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
give it a try I think for us we we've

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.999 
give it a try I think for us we we've
kind<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.020> taken<00:02:09.140> Frogger<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> different

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
kind of taken Frogger in a different

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
kind of taken Frogger in a different
direction<00:02:10.100> over<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.640> years<00:02:10.850> like<00:02:11.450> initially

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
direction over the years like initially

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.720 
direction over the years like initially
it<00:02:12.020> was<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.709> know<00:02:12.800> 8-bit<00:02:13.220> arcade

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
it was all I like you know 8-bit arcade

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.910 
it was all I like you know 8-bit arcade
and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:14.870> during<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.590> know<00:02:15.680> kind<00:02:15.890> of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
and then during like you know kind of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.470 
and then during like you know kind of
have<00:02:16.040> like<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.190> family<00:02:16.400> Frogger<00:02:16.820> center<00:02:17.150> period

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
have like a family Frogger center period

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.930 
have like a family Frogger center period
we're<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:17.810> brothers<00:02:18.680> maybe<00:02:19.489> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
we're like brothers maybe the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.370 
we're like brothers maybe the
PlayStation<00:02:20.450> ER<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.110> little<00:02:21.290> bit

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
