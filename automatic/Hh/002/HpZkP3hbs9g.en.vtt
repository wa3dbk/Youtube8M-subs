for<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> game<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.180> problem<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
for the one on the game no problem so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500 
for the one on the game no problem so
there's<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.620> defending<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.090> with

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's all about defending it with

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.060 
there's all about defending it with
passion<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.989> also<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> sort<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.890> new

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
passion but also we sort of use new

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.510 
passion but also we sort of use new
using<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.730> brain<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.340> think<00:00:59.340> we

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
using your brain as well so I think we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.709
