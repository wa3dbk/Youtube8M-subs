looking thing on the top is is a muffler
of<00:00:39.690> sorts<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.850> an<00:00:42.000> oiler

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of sorts and this back here is an oiler

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.770

for<00:00:42.629> operation<00:00:43.140> under<00:00:43.379> steam<00:00:44.629> right<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
for operation under steam right now I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
for operation under steam right now I
have<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.079> set<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> run<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.860> air<00:00:47.100> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
have it set up to run on air just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.650 
have it set up to run on air just
because<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.030> controllable

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because it's a little more controllable

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
because it's a little more controllable
fulfilling<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.550> gonna

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
fulfilling so that's what we're gonna

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.799 
fulfilling so that's what we're gonna
see<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.059> gonna<00:00:51.149> give<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> couple<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
see we're gonna give it a couple of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
see we're gonna give it a couple of
pounds<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.230> pressure<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.910> not<00:00:53.910> much<00:00:54.149> doesn't

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
pounds of pressure here not much doesn't

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.740 
pounds of pressure here not much doesn't
take<00:00:54.690> much<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> run<00:00:55.910> as<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.149> look<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> gauge

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
take much to run as I look at the gauge

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.139 
take much to run as I look at the gauge
on<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.140> regulator<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.550> psi

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
on my regulator that's about two psi

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.869 
on my regulator that's about two psi
right<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.219> running<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
right now and I like running it at that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.750 
right now and I like running it at that
speed<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> watch<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> motion<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:05.129> we'll

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
speed just to watch the motion but we'll

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109 
speed just to watch the motion but we'll
speed<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:07.470> 218<00:01:08.310> psi<00:01:08.880> which

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
speed it up here to about 218 psi which

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
speed it up here to about 218 psi which
is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> maximum<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.049> give<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:11.060> they<00:01:12.060> could

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
is the maximum I can give it they could

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
is the maximum I can give it they could
probably<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.200> spike

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
probably take more but my spike

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
probably take more but my spike
compressor<00:01:13.920> only<00:01:14.220> goes<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.670> high<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
compressor only goes up that high and as

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
compressor only goes up that high and as
we<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> close<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.860> definitely

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
we get close to that if definitely

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.450 
we get close to that if definitely
becomes<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.299> blur<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.930> prop<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:23.280> much

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
becomes a blur on the prop not much

becomes a blur on the prop not much
sound<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.470> smooth<00:01:25.890> action<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
sound from it but very smooth action and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.170 
sound from it but very smooth action and
I'm<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.900> pleased<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> really

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
I'm very pleased with it really

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.130 
I'm very pleased with it really
unique<00:01:29.600> kind<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:29.930> an<00:01:30.050> engine<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:32.600> back<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.960> back

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
unique kind of an engine to back it back

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.350 
unique kind of an engine to back it back
down<00:01:33.440> now<00:01:33.710> exactly<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.340> think<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> more<00:01:35.000> fun<00:01:35.210> to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
down now exactly I think the more fun to

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.600 
down now exactly I think the more fun to
watch<00:01:35.510> it<00:01:35.720> go<00:01:35.840> slow<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.380> my<00:01:39.530> fourth<00:01:39.890> line

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
watch it go slow this is my fourth line

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.360 
watch it go slow this is my fourth line
II<00:01:40.640> engine<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.770> by<00:01:42.770> far<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.250> most

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
II engine and by far the most

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.610 
II engine and by far the most
sophisticated<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:44.390> those<00:01:44.600> I've<00:01:45.170> gotten<00:01:45.530> from

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
sophisticated of those I've gotten from

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.540 
sophisticated of those I've gotten from
them<00:01:50.560> no<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:51.860> think<00:01:52.160> it's<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
them no I just think it's a thing of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.240 
them no I just think it's a thing of
beauty<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.120> like<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.390> call<00:01:53.420> them<00:01:54.250> that's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
beauty as I like to call them that's

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.100 
beauty as I like to call them that's
about<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.730> I<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.000> wanted<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.570> share<00:01:57.050> that

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
about it I just wanted to share that

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.740 
about it I just wanted to share that
with<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.910> some<00:01:58.910> workmanship<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.720> I

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
with you and some workmanship that I

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.120 
with you and some workmanship that I
think<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.290> just<00:02:00.800> above<00:02:01.220> car<00:02:01.930> take<00:02:02.930> care<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.410> will

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
think is just above car take care I will

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.510 
think is just above car take care I will
leave<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.369> run<00:02:04.520> for<00:02:04.700> another<00:02:04.850> ten<00:02:05.060> seconds

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.720 

okay<00:02:13.520> thanks<00:02:13.850> for<00:02:13.910> watching<00:02:14.360> bye-bye
