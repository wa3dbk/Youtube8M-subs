00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:20.790
 this subaru is a judgment of the impreza 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.790
 wrx sti from cook 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:29.350
 440 ps four- wheel drive board has that 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.350
 Chassis endless traction addiction 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.910
 just right for our professional 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.800
 tester mathias lauda 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 The hinged door is just waiting for him 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 our expert spurs himself 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 rather normal wrx sti has the reputation of one 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.850
 brutal athlete by the customer in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850
 a mountain 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 behind the power explosion is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.150
 most elaborate engine refinement for 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.909
 around 19,600 euros 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.149
 air to breathe 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.920
 when upshifting 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.450
 from 3500 revolutions sets the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 Forced ventilation like a steam hammer 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.680
 the over impreza is a macho 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.130
 but that's exactly what he looks like in civilian clothes 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.400
 that wing and spoilerwerk is 100% brx 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.300
 sc ii series brakes and landing gear cook 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.660
 however further optimized thanks to doping

 kur activates the boxer power station 176 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.060
 horses per liter displacement in wind rope 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.020
 quickly the tachometer to 7500 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.020
 turns high 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.620
 so if you dare to go now 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
 accelerate 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.310
 in the car 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.209
 only wonder 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 a maximum of 270 km h are respected 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.569
 more inspiring than that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.110
 top speed is pure 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.110
 spurt assets 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.420
 It will be completely and fun 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.549
 the tank 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 because at full throttle gas that devours 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:02.859
 monster naughty 28 liters super plus 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.989
 even the cockpit leaves the chef untouched 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.959
 apart from the small boost pressure 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.969
 Display closely the ikarus and one 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.709
 crisp circuit needs more 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.859
 driver not to be happy anyway 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.859
 his 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.569
 thanks to hard vote and super direct 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.239
 steering would be the impreza ragged around the 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.280
 pylons problem on asphalt has that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.719
 chassis almost too much grip and 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.719
 therefore tends to understeer 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.109
 in the wild speak up 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.489
 There is no gravel or sand 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.489
 keep up with the all-wheeler 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.820
 in terms of agility and curvenspeed lies 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.410
 the japanese a way to the day that 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.510
 hear us and see passes 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:04:05.080
 to drive it across, it demands 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:06.730
 a knowledgeable hand like that 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.470
 fast one with the distinctive rally 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.660
 Boliden can roar through the area 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.600
 even if it is only on unpaved 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.140
 The 440 ps are really full 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.140
 auszureizen 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.759
 on the whole is really cool 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.070
 dare and 60,000 euro costs the cooker 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.320
 kÃ¤the not too much for that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.320
 daily dose of adrenaline
