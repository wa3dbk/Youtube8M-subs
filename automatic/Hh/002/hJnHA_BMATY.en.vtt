00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
these games it's just the mopping up but

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260 
these games it's just the mopping up but
they<00:01:14.200> just<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:15.340> want<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.610> be<00:01:15.730> I<00:01:15.820> think<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
they just really want to be I think the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.930 
they just really want to be I think the
most<00:01:16.530> efficient<00:01:17.530> deal<00:01:20.490> because<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.700> it's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
most efficient deal because it's it's

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.030 
most efficient deal because it's it's
actually<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> very<00:01:22.540> common<00:01:22.690> question<00:01:23.200> when<00:01:23.770> an

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
actually a very common question when an

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.980 
actually a very common question when an
amateur<00:01:24.220> approached<00:01:24.940> me<00:01:25.240> sometimes<00:01:25.720> during<00:01:25.870> a

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
amateur approached me sometimes during a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.330 
amateur approached me sometimes during a
poker<00:01:26.200> tournament<00:01:26.500> because<00:01:27.010> they<00:01:27.160> know<00:01:27.310> that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
poker tournament because they know that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.640 
poker tournament because they know that
I'm<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> grandmaster<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.690> they<00:01:28.870> would<00:01:29.440> always

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
I'm a grandmaster and they would always

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.900 
I'm a grandmaster and they would always
ask<00:01:30.070> me<00:01:31.410> master<00:01:32.410> how<00:01:33.070> many<00:01:33.280> moves<00:01:33.550> would<00:01:33.850> I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
ask me master how many moves would I

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
lost against is actually to explain that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.170 
lost against is actually to explain that
it's<00:01:37.720> not<00:01:38.050> always<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.650> matter<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.369> time<00:01:39.670> yeah

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
it's not always the matter of time yeah

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's not always the matter of time yeah
maybe<00:01:40.660> of<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> precision<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.710> mean<00:01:41.890> sometimes

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
maybe of the precision I mean sometimes

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.740 
maybe of the precision I mean sometimes
sometimes<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:45.060> game<00:01:46.060> against<00:01:46.600> an

moves you have a very good fight and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.480 
moves you have a very good fight and
then<00:02:00.430> somehow<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.320> then<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.310> other

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
then somehow and then you have other

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.990 
then somehow and then you have other
games<00:02:03.759> where<00:02:04.270> you're<00:02:04.540> just<00:02:05.369> winning<00:02:06.369> from

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.559 
games where you're just winning from
quite<00:02:07.420> early<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.100> no<00:02:09.310> fight<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.360> it

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
quite early on there is no fight but it

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.290 
quite early on there is no fight but it
just<00:02:10.810> takes<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> long<00:02:11.620> time<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.300> remove

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
just takes you a long time to remove

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.020 
just takes you a long time to remove
their<00:02:13.630> pieces<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.350> by<00:02:14.560> one<00:02:14.800> before<00:02:15.160> sometimes

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
their pieces one by one before sometimes

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.059 
their pieces one by one before sometimes
sometimes<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.020> could<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.380> strategical

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
sometimes it could be a strategical

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.750 
sometimes it could be a strategical
fight<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:18.610> could<00:02:18.850> take<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.180> lot<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:23.760> factors

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
fight which could take a lot of factors

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.600 
fight which could take a lot of factors
but<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.990> very<00:02:26.200> common<00:02:26.500> question<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.340> they

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
but it's a very common question so they

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.210 
but it's a very common question so they
would<00:02:27.730> say<00:02:28.020> what<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.050> lost<00:02:29.440> longer<00:02:29.890> than<00:02:30.069> my

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
would say what I lost longer than my

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.170 
would say what I lost longer than my
friend<00:02:30.580> did<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> matter<00:02:34.000> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
friend did and then it's not a matter of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.230 
friend did and then it's not a matter of
comparison

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.330 

this<00:02:42.240> woman<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.980> getting<00:02:44.930> very<00:02:45.930> close

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.060 

I<00:02:52.670> think<00:02:53.670> Gary's<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.510> asking<00:02:54.930> himself<00:02:55.110> why<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
I think Gary's is asking himself why and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070 
I think Gary's is asking himself why and
there's<00:02:56.250> people<00:02:56.550> not<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.060> incite<00:02:57.360> against<00:02:57.930> me

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
there's people not to incite against me

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.710 
there's people not to incite against me
yeah<00:02:58.340> I'm<00:02:59.340> Claire<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.950> deserved<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.720> actually

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
yeah I'm Claire I deserved it I actually
have<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.410> kind<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.770> feeling<00:03:05.010> sometimes

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
have this kind of feeling sometimes

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.130 
have this kind of feeling sometimes
state<00:03:06.150> okay

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
state okay

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.090 
state okay
I've<00:03:07.950> calculated<00:03:08.370> everything<00:03:09.090> right<00:03:10.100> he's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
I've calculated everything right he's

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.140 
I've calculated everything right he's
making<00:03:11.520> all<00:03:11.640> these<00:03:11.850> moves<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.390> he's<00:03:12.600> kind<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.400 

that<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> bit<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.750> psychological

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
that was a bit of psychological

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.050 
that was a bit of psychological
