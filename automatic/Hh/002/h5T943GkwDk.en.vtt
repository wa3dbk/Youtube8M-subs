00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
in this video I'll be showing you how to

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.450 
in this video I'll be showing you how to
do<00:00:10.730> intarsia<00:00:11.330> cabling<00:00:11.990> this<00:00:12.500> is<00:00:12.680> where<00:00:12.860> one<00:00:13.190> or

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
do intarsia cabling this is where one or

is<00:00:14.940> actually<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.540> different<00:00:15.570> color<00:00:16.200> than

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
is actually in a different color than

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380 
is actually in a different color than
the<00:00:16.650> rest<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> background<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.360> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the rest of the background this is a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
the rest of the background this is a
really<00:00:18.810> fun<00:00:19.200> thing<00:00:19.530> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
really fun thing to do and you can

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.269 
really fun thing to do and you can
create<00:00:20.700> all<00:00:20.940> kinds<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.450> interesting<00:00:22.279> color

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
create all kinds of interesting color

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
create all kinds of interesting color
patterns<00:00:23.790> and<00:00:24.000> variations<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:24.900> cable

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
patterns and variations in your cable

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.620 
patterns and variations in your cable
garments<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.040> way

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
garments this way

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
garments this way
working<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> Tarsha<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.470> cables<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> same

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
working in Tarsha and cables at the same

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.640 
working in Tarsha and cables at the same
time<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.570> daunting<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.470> does

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
time is a bit daunting because it does

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.760 
time is a bit daunting because it does
slow<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.950> down<00:00:32.190> but<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.669> adds<00:00:32.820> kind<00:00:33.150> of<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
slow you down but it adds kind of a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.140 
slow you down but it adds kind of a
different<00:00:34.770> sort<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.700> cables

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
different sort of look to your cables

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.020 
different sort of look to your cables
and<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.960> way<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> bring<00:00:38.730> attention

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and in this way you can bring attention

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.049 
and in this way you can bring attention
to<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.900> motif<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.739> maybe<00:00:41.460> would<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.850> lost

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
to a motif that maybe would get lost

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.320 
to a motif that maybe would get lost
otherwise<00:00:42.449> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.330> the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
otherwise you can have one of the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.990 
otherwise you can have one of the
particular<00:00:46.260> strands<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> braided<00:00:47.489> cable

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
particular strands of a braided cable

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
particular strands of a braided cable
for<00:00:48.180> instance<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.839> different<00:00:49.230> color<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
for instance be a different color and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
for instance be a different color and
you<00:00:49.769> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.430> myriad<00:00:50.879> ways<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.330> which<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can see the myriad ways in which it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can see the myriad ways in which it
weaves<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.589> design<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
weaves in and out of your design you can

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.430 
weaves in and out of your design you can
choose<00:00:54.330> to<00:00:54.540> do<00:00:54.979> one<00:00:55.979> color<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.820> each<00:00:57.269> of<00:00:57.720> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
choose to do one color for each of the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
choose to do one color for each of the
strands<00:00:58.860> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> cable<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.580> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.699> have

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
strands of the cable so you can have

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
strands of the cable so you can have
different<00:01:00.780> colors<00:01:01.229> for<00:01:01.440> each<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.190> have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
different colors for each one you have

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
different colors for each one you have
yellow<00:01:02.850> blue<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.300> orange<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
yellow blue and orange if you want to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.240 
yellow blue and orange if you want to
then<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> them

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
then have them

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820 
then have them
weave<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.710> familiar

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
weave in and out and if you're familiar

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590 
weave in and out and if you're familiar
with<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.760> work<00:01:08.940> intarsia

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
with the way you would work intarsia

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.950 
with the way you would work intarsia
this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.310> same<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this is pretty much the same thing the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
this is pretty much the same thing the
only<00:01:13.409> difference<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.370> cables

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
only difference is with the cables

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
only difference is with the cables
because<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.900> row<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.530> stitching<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because the the row of stitching is is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.410 
because the the row of stitching is is
moving<00:01:18.439> relative<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.710> background<00:01:20.420> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
moving relative to the background you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.260 
moving relative to the background you
don't<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.990> need<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.649> have<00:01:22.969> separate<00:01:23.969> balls

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
don't really need to have separate balls

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.389 
don't really need to have separate balls
of<00:01:24.509> color<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.110> each<00:01:25.289> section<00:01:25.829> of<00:01:25.920> background

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
of color for each section of background

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.399 
of color for each section of background
and<00:01:26.880> also<00:01:27.149> because<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> very<00:01:27.960> small

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and also because it's a very small

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499 
and also because it's a very small
amount<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.829> stitches<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.340> only<00:01:29.490> three<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
amount of stitches it's only three you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.719 
amount of stitches it's only three you
actually<00:01:30.719> will<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:32.180> pass<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:34.729> working

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
actually will just pass the working

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.719 
actually will just pass the working
yarns<00:01:36.210> over<00:01:36.930> each<00:01:37.079> other<00:01:37.369> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.490> weaving

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
yarns over each other kind of weaving

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.200 
yarns over each other kind of weaving
them<00:01:39.000> along<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> carrying<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.259> behind<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
them along and carrying them behind as

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.749 
them along and carrying them behind as
you<00:01:42.210> work<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
you work so in that way you can kind of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
you work so in that way you can kind of
see<00:01:44.969> here<00:01:45.299> how<00:01:45.479> they're<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.469> carried<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
see here how they're just carried up and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.820 
see here how they're just carried up and
carried<00:01:48.270> across<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.429> back

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.859 

so

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
so

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.560 
so
you<00:01:56.439> can<00:01:56.649> do<00:01:56.829> these<00:01:57.130> cable<00:01:57.520> sensors<00:01:57.880> are<00:01:58.179> so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
you can do these cable sensors are so

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.450 
you can do these cable sensors are so
small<00:01:58.899> I<00:01:58.929> just<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> tiny<00:01:59.979> little<00:02:00.219> amount

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
small I just have a tiny little amount

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.849 
small I just have a tiny little amount
of<00:02:00.729> yarn<00:02:01.509> here<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.960> can<00:02:02.109> use<00:02:02.259> little<00:02:02.530> scraps

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
of yarn here you can use little scraps

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.260 
of yarn here you can use little scraps
of<00:02:03.100> yarn<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.609> actually<00:02:03.969> get<00:02:04.119> some<00:02:04.240> good

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
of yarn and actually get some good

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.919 
of yarn and actually get some good
mileage<00:02:04.659> out<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.640> I'm<00:02:07.509> going<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.750> do

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
mileage out of it so I'm going to do

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.650 
mileage out of it so I'm going to do
this<00:02:08.080> cable<00:02:08.560> which<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:10.360> right<00:02:10.629> here

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
this cable which is actually right here

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.949 
this cable which is actually right here
where<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.590> bring<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.519> main<00:02:12.879> color<00:02:13.209> cable<00:02:13.750> on

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
where you bring the main color cable on

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.130 
where you bring the main color cable on
top<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:15.069> over<00:02:15.489> top<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.769> entire<00:02:17.769> cable<00:02:18.580> here

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
top of over top of the entire cable here

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.990 
top of over top of the entire cable here
so<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.319> entire<00:02:20.349> cable<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.580> go<00:02:21.730> on

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so the entire cable is going to go on

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.160 
so the entire cable is going to go on
the<00:02:22.090> cable<00:02:22.390> needle<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:26.290> held<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the cable needle and be held in back and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.970 
the cable needle and be held in back and
then<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.739> main<00:02:33.340> color<00:02:33.640> yarn<00:02:34.799> make<00:02:35.799> sure

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
then with the main color yarn make sure

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.130 
then with the main color yarn make sure
that's<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.370> front<00:02:37.049> find<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.200> these

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.900 

and<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:44.950> either<00:02:45.040> knit<00:02:45.280> off<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.580> cable

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and you can either knit off the cable

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.840 
and you can either knit off the cable
needle<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.300> slip<00:02:46.570> them<00:02:46.720> back<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:48.460> your<00:02:48.640> working

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
needle or slip them back to your working

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.920 
needle or slip them back to your working
needle<00:02:50.280> now<00:02:51.280> before<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.210> just<00:02:52.420> go<00:02:52.600> ahead<00:02:52.720> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
needle now before you just go ahead and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.680 
needle now before you just go ahead and
knit<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.150> make<00:02:55.270> sure<00:02:55.300> that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
knit that you want to make sure that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.870 
knit that you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:55.870> bringing<00:02:56.440> up<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:58.270> intarsia<00:02:58.720> strand

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
you're bringing up the intarsia strand

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.760 
you're bringing up the intarsia strand
from<00:03:00.880> underneath<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.910> other<00:03:04.510> yarn<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.440> in

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
from underneath the other yarn so the in

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.740 
from underneath the other yarn so the in
this<00:03:06.100> case<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> green<00:03:06.700> yarn<00:03:07.030> being<00:03:07.270> over<00:03:07.570> top

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
this case the green yarn being over top

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.190 
this case the green yarn being over top
the<00:03:08.490> yellow<00:03:09.490> yarn<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.180> underneath<00:03:10.780> that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the yellow yarn will be underneath that

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.860 
the yellow yarn will be underneath that
and<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:11.920> when<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.360> change<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> colors

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
and then when you change the colors

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.500 
and then when you change the colors
again<00:03:14.020> after<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.970> same<00:03:16.180> thing

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
again after this it's the same thing

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.210 
again after this it's the same thing
where<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.930> next<00:03:17.110> color<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.650> use<00:03:17.830> comes<00:03:18.130> from

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
where the next color you use comes from

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.449 
where the next color you use comes from
underneath<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.360> they<00:03:19.480> effectively<00:03:19.900> get

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
underneath so they effectively get

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.790 
underneath so they effectively get
wrapped<00:03:21.459> around<00:03:21.670> each<00:03:22.060> other<00:03:22.330> so<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.620> just

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
wrapped around each other so you just

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.010 
wrapped around each other so you just
knit<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.840> other<00:03:26.080> color<00:03:26.380> cable<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.690> again

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
knit the other color cable and again

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.160 
knit the other color cable and again
bring<00:03:29.739> this<00:03:29.920> from<00:03:30.160> underneath<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.840> next

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
bring this from underneath on the next

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.620 
bring this from underneath on the next
row<00:03:32.380> basically<00:03:32.650> what<00:03:33.190> happens<00:03:33.610> is<00:03:33.850> when<00:03:34.600> you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
row basically what happens is when you

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.330 
row basically what happens is when you
bring<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.080> yellow<00:03:35.320> from<00:03:35.560> underneath<00:03:35.860> that's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
bring the yellow from underneath that's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.400 
bring the yellow from underneath that's
when<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.880> twist<00:03:37.270> in<00:03:37.540> them<00:03:37.690> just<00:03:38.260> like

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
when you get a twist in them just like

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
when you get a twist in them just like
that<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:40.030> way<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:42.100> don't<00:03:42.130> end<00:03:42.459> up<00:03:42.910> with

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
that so that way you don't end up with

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.270 
that so that way you don't end up with
that<00:03:43.420> funny<00:03:43.720> problem<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.320> having<00:03:44.440> essentially

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that funny problem of having essentially

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.009 
that funny problem of having essentially
a<00:03:45.430> separate<00:03:47.700> section<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:49.239> knitting<00:03:49.720> sort<00:03:49.959> of

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
a separate section of knitting sort of

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.050 
a separate section of knitting sort of
floating<00:03:50.440> around<00:03:50.500> on<00:03:50.920> top<00:03:51.130> because<00:03:51.489> then<00:03:51.670> you

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
floating around on top because then you

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.410 
floating around on top because then you
can<00:03:52.239> definitely<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.530> with<00:03:53.980> any<00:03:54.390> bit<00:03:55.390> of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
can definitely get that with any bit of

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.300 
can definitely get that with any bit of
intarsia<00:03:55.840> if<00:03:56.140> then<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.769> colors<00:03:57.040> aren't

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
intarsia if then if the colors aren't

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.800 
intarsia if then if the colors aren't
wrapped<00:03:57.459> around<00:03:57.640> each<00:03:57.940> other<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.570> case

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
wrapped around each other in this case

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.170 
wrapped around each other in this case
because<00:03:59.489> you're<00:04:00.489> not<00:04:00.670> actually<00:04:00.940> using

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
because you're not actually using

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.870 
because you're not actually using
separate<00:04:02.019> balls<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.560> yarn<00:04:02.880> because

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
separate balls of yarn because

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.820 
separate balls of yarn because
everything<00:04:04.690> moves<00:04:06.209> doing<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.510> way<00:04:07.830> you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
everything moves doing it that way you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.890 
everything moves doing it that way you
actually<00:04:09.160> kind<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.400> see<00:04:09.640> how<00:04:09.820> it's<00:04:10.030> how<00:04:10.750> it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
actually kind of see how it's how it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.830 
actually kind of see how it's how it
wraps<00:04:11.200> around<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.970> back<00:04:13.120> here<00:04:13.450> just<00:04:13.660> by

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
wraps around the back here just by

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.259 
wraps around the back here just by
wrapping<00:04:14.200> them<00:04:14.320> around<00:04:14.350> each<00:04:14.650> other<00:04:15.269> it

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
wrapping them around each other it

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.710 
wrapping them around each other it
creates<00:04:16.660> sort<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.989> chain-link<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:18.720> keeps

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
creates sort of a chain-link that keeps

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.430 
creates sort of a chain-link that keeps
the<00:04:20.410> entire<00:04:20.769> cable<00:04:21.310> part<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.810> main<00:04:23.080> body

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
the entire cable part of the main body

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.530 
the entire cable part of the main body
of<00:04:23.800> your<00:04:24.700> knitting

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.940 

a<00:04:27.590> little<00:04:28.590> bit<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.060> if<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.350> continue<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.680> that

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
a little bit and if you continue in that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.480 
a little bit and if you continue in that
way<00:04:33.560> essentially<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.770> can<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.160> can<00:04:35.310> move

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
way essentially you can you can move

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.870 
way essentially you can you can move
that<00:04:36.200> bit<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:38.040> know<00:04:38.130> in<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.340> case<00:04:38.490> yellow

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
that bit of you know in this case yellow

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.240 
that bit of you know in this case yellow
cabling<00:04:39.450> anywhere<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.050> want<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:41.070> not

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
cabling anywhere you want and it's not

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.280 
cabling anywhere you want and it's not
going<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.610> create<00:04:41.970> any<00:04:42.210> sort<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:42.630> problems<00:04:43.110> as

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
going to create any sort of problems as

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
intarsia you know since you are just

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.320 
intarsia you know since you are just

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
background in this case you're not going

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760 
background in this case you're not going
to<00:05:14.460> have<00:05:14.640> all<00:05:15.060> those<00:05:15.480> ends<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.080> weave<00:05:16.230> in<00:05:16.530> and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
to have all those ends to weave in and

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.710 
to have all those ends to weave in and
even<00:05:17.430> though<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:17.670> is<00:05:17.850> moving<00:05:18.240> relative<00:05:18.690> to

even though this is moving relative to
the<00:05:18.900> background<00:05:19.020> it's<00:05:19.590> just<00:05:19.950> one<00:05:20.640> column<00:05:21.360> of

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
the background it's just one column of

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.340 
the background it's just one column of
stitches<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.410> not<00:05:22.650> actually<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:25.080> know<00:05:25.170> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
stitches it's not actually you know the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.350 
stitches it's not actually you know the
stitches<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.550> motif<00:05:28.130> creating<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.220> shape<00:05:29.430> this

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
stitches the motif creating a shape this

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.970 
stitches the motif creating a shape this
is<00:05:30.540> actually<00:05:30.900> just<00:05:31.110> one<00:05:31.230> column<00:05:31.740> stitches

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
is actually just one column stitches

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.100 
is actually just one column stitches
being<00:05:32.310> moved<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.600> don't<00:05:33.780> have<00:05:33.930> those

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
being moved so you don't have those

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.630 
being moved so you don't have those
interesting<00:05:34.560> offshoots<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.460> might

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
interesting offshoots that you might

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.540 
interesting offshoots that you might
have<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:36.060> in<00:05:36.180> Tarsha<00:05:36.450> that<00:05:36.750> create<00:05:37.560> gaps<00:05:38.220> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
have in in Tarsha that create gaps and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.940 
have in in Tarsha that create gaps and
things<00:05:38.670> like<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:40.080> intarsia<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.650> cabling

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
things like that so intarsia and cabling

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.060 
things like that so intarsia and cabling
again<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.370> takes<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.760> little<00:05:41.970> bit<00:05:42.090> longer

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
again it takes a little bit longer

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.650 
again it takes a little bit longer
because<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.370> know<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.520> do<00:05:45.240> have<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.420> remember

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
because you know you do have to remember

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.170 
because you know you do have to remember
to<00:05:45.930> wrap<00:05:46.110> your<00:05:46.350> yarns<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:46.950> everything<00:05:47.340> both

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
to wrap your yarns and everything both

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.940 
to wrap your yarns and everything both
on<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.450> front<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.140> back<00:05:49.260> every<00:05:49.740> single

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
on the front and the back every single

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.060 
on the front and the back every single
row<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.250> want<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.640> wrap<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:52.230> next<00:05:52.530> color<00:05:52.980> that

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
row you want to wrap the next color that

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.150 
row you want to wrap the next color that
you're<00:05:53.370> going<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.550> use<00:05:53.790> underneath<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.920> color

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
you're going to use underneath the color

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.150 
you're going to use underneath the color
that<00:05:56.460> you<00:05:56.580> just<00:05:56.820> did<00:05:58.640> it's<00:06:00.620> just<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.740> really

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160

that you just did it's just a really
cool<00:06:02.490> way<00:06:02.850> to<00:06:02.910> add<00:06:03.330> some<00:06:03.600> interest<00:06:03.960> to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
cool way to add some interest to

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.290 
cool way to add some interest to
something<00:06:04.500> especially<00:06:05.070> if<00:06:05.100> you're<00:06:05.310> doing<00:06:05.460> you

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
want to have to sit there and look at

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.060 
want to have to sit there and look at
just<00:06:13.500> plain<00:06:13.920> white<00:06:14.540> cable<00:06:15.560> over<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:16.740> over

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
just plain white cable over and over

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.460 
just plain white cable over and over
again<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:18.360> put<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> shot<00:06:18.900> of<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:19.140> different

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
again you put a shot of a different

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.600 
again you put a shot of a different
color<00:06:19.620> in<00:06:19.800> there<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.040> it'll<00:06:20.160> actually<00:06:20.340> be

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
color in there and it'll actually be

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.100 
color in there and it'll actually be
really<00:06:20.850> excited<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.450> get<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:21.720> that<00:06:21.840> point

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
really excited to get to that point

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.430 
really excited to get to that point
every<00:06:22.410> time<00:06:22.670> see<00:06:23.670> here<00:06:23.880> on<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.060> back<00:06:24.440> yellow

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
every time see here on the back yellow

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.120 
every time see here on the back yellow
is<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.560> next<00:06:25.800> color<00:06:25.920> bringing<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:26.490> underneath

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
is the next color bringing it underneath

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.550 
is the next color bringing it underneath
figuring<00:06:29.130> that<00:06:29.250> was<00:06:29.400> just<00:06:29.580> used<00:06:30.410> you<00:06:31.410> work

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
figuring that was just used you work

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.860 
figuring that was just used you work
across

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.420 

now<00:06:35.870> I'm<00:06:35.930> going<00:06:36.110> to<00:06:36.140> use<00:06:36.200> green<00:06:36.590> bring<00:06:37.310> it

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
now I'm going to use green bring it

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.450 
now I'm going to use green bring it
underneath<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:39.110> yellow<00:06:39.350> that<00:06:39.620> was<00:06:39.680> just<00:06:40.070> used

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.180 

and<00:06:43.460> every<00:06:44.390> single<00:06:44.810> row<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.080> do<00:06:45.470> that<00:06:45.740> and<00:06:46.010> it

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
and every single row you do that and it

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.810 
and every single row you do that and it
will<00:06:46.340> just<00:06:47.350> bind<00:06:48.350> together<00:06:48.620> seamlessly<00:06:49.190> and

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
will just bind together seamlessly and

approximation<00:07:03.050> of<00:07:03.230> highlighter<00:07:03.650> yellow<00:07:04.040> but

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
approximation of highlighter yellow but

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.680 
approximation of highlighter yellow but
this<00:07:04.340> is<00:07:04.490> basically<00:07:04.880> how<00:07:05.150> you<00:07:05.210> would<00:07:05.330> show

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
this is basically how you would show

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.040 
this is basically how you would show
that<00:07:05.930> this<00:07:06.530> is<00:07:06.770> the<00:07:06.920> color<00:07:07.130> that<00:07:07.990> you<00:07:08.990> know

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
that this is the color that you know

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.660 
that this is the color that you know
this<00:07:09.200> is<00:07:09.320> the<00:07:09.440> cable<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.800> I<00:07:09.890> want<00:07:10.190> to<00:07:10.250> make<00:07:10.430> a

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
this is the cable that I want to make a

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.950 
this is the cable that I want to make a
different<00:07:11.090> color<00:07:11.240> so<00:07:11.510> I'm<00:07:11.660> just<00:07:11.810> going<00:07:11.930> to

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
different color so I'm just going to

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.020 
different color so I'm just going to
scribble<00:07:12.830> it<00:07:12.920> in<00:07:13.010> a<00:07:13.100> different<00:07:13.400> color<00:07:13.550> you<00:07:13.910> can

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
scribble it in a different color you can

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.550 
scribble it in a different color you can
obviously<00:07:14.450> see<00:07:14.780> where<00:07:14.960> the<00:07:15.080> cables<00:07:15.440> are

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
obviously see where the cables are

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.640 
obviously see where the cables are
crossing<00:07:16.040> which<00:07:16.580> color<00:07:16.910> goes<00:07:17.150> where

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
crossing which color goes where

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
crossing which color goes where
everything<00:07:18.650> like<00:07:18.770> that<00:07:18.950> so<00:07:19.100> it's<00:07:19.220> really<00:07:19.250> easy

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.670 
everything like that so it's really easy

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.450 
everything like that so it's really easy
to<00:07:19.880> take<00:07:20.810> any<00:07:21.080> existing<00:07:21.710> cable<00:07:22.040> pattern<00:07:22.340> that

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
to take any existing cable pattern that

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.880 
to take any existing cable pattern that
you<00:07:22.580> have<00:07:22.660> turn<00:07:23.660> it<00:07:23.810> into<00:07:23.960> an<00:07:24.140> entire<00:07:24.410> cable

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
you have turn it into an entire cable

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.150 
you have turn it into an entire cable
you<00:07:25.610> work<00:07:25.820> it<00:07:25.970> like<00:07:26.120> this<00:07:26.390> and<00:07:26.770> you<00:07:27.770> get<00:07:27.920> some

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 
you work it like this and you get some

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.140 
you work it like this and you get some
really<00:07:28.190> really<00:07:28.910> neat<00:07:29.600> results
