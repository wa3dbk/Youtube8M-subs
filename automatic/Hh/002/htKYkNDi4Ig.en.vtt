everybody<00:00:10.559> that's<00:00:10.800> lost<00:00:11.099> weight<00:00:11.400> before<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
everybody that's lost weight before and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910 
everybody that's lost weight before and
gained<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.240> back<00:00:12.269> always<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.469> looking<00:00:13.769> for

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
gained it back always is looking for

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
gained it back always is looking for
people<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.549> fall<00:00:15.059> flat<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.450> their<00:00:15.599> face<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.320> to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
people to fall flat on their face and to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.019 
people to fall flat on their face and to
gain<00:00:16.949> back<00:00:17.130> everything<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.640> they<00:00:17.850> lost

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
gain back everything that they lost

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
gain back everything that they lost
especially<00:00:18.480> before<00:00:18.930> they'll<00:00:19.230> even<00:00:19.289> jump<00:00:19.740> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
especially before they'll even jump in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
especially before they'll even jump in
and<00:00:20.580> try<00:00:20.760> whatever<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.810> tried

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and try whatever it is that you tried

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
and try whatever it is that you tried
now<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> difference<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.369> me<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
now the difference for me with the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089 
now the difference for me with the
program<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.050> used<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.529> lose<00:00:25.650> weight<00:00:25.830> all

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
program that I used to lose weight all

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.500 
program that I used to lose weight all
of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> other<00:00:26.519> programs<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.119> I'd<00:00:27.269> try

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
of the other programs that I'd try

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
of the other programs that I'd try
before<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.710> learn

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
before what they actually learn

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
before what they actually learn
something<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.150> program<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.660> learned<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
something on this program I learned a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
something on this program I learned a
lot<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.349> my<00:00:31.590> body<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.099> learned<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
lot about my body I learned how it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
lot about my body I learned how it
worked<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.420> learned<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> responded<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
worked I learned what it responded to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
worked I learned what it responded to
and<00:00:35.160> learn<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> liked<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.940> didn't<00:00:36.120> like

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and learn what it liked it didn't like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.569 
and learn what it liked it didn't like
what<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> needed<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.930> didn't<00:00:37.170> need

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
what it needed what it didn't need

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
what it needed what it didn't need
things<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.820> never<00:00:38.879> had<00:00:39.420> any<00:00:39.629> clue<00:00:40.140> about

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
things that I never had any clue about

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
things that I never had any clue about
before<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.190> wouldn't<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> not

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
before that I wouldn't know had I not

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.979 
before that I wouldn't know had I not
found<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> program<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.719> it's<00:00:45.719> very

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
found that program so it's very

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
found that program so it's very
important<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> pay<00:00:47.700> really<00:00:47.910> close

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
attention when you're on the program and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.790 
attention when you're on the program and
for<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.770> too<00:00:50.070> honest<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> god<00:00:51.079> no<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.410> program

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
for you too honest to god no the program

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319 
for you too honest to god no the program

people that are very knowledgeable about

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
people that are very knowledgeable about
the<00:01:05.760> program<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> learned<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.619> because

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the program that I learned from because

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.270 
the program that I learned from because
they<00:01:08.490> read<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> book<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> reader<00:01:10.650> but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
they read the book I'm not a reader but

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
want to give me directions to cuddle bug

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.010 
want to give me directions to cuddle bug
would<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.979> um<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
would be good so um if you know the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
would be good so um if you know the
program<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:20.400> well<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> understand

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
program really well and you understand

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
program really well and you understand
why<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.049> take<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> principles

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
why it was you can take the principles

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
why it was you can take the principles
and<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.939> change<00:01:24.210> relationship

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and you can take the change relationship

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
and you can take the change relationship
that<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.500> food<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.490> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that you then have with food and you can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.510 
that you then have with food and you can
apply<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:28.049> maintenance<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
apply that for maintenance so I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
apply that for maintenance so I
personally<00:01:30.450> chose<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> eat<00:01:31.380> any<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
personally chose not to eat any of the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590 
personally chose not to eat any of the
meta<00:01:32.040> fast<00:01:32.280> food<00:01:32.579> when<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.270> maintenance

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
meta fast food when I was on maintenance

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140 
meta fast food when I was on maintenance
I'm<00:01:33.960> still<00:01:34.320> maintaining<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.400> maintenance<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I'm still maintaining on maintenance and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.580 
I'm still maintaining on maintenance and
will<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> rest<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.110> life<00:01:37.350> um<00:01:37.979> I
