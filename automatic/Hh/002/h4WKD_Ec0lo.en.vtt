Lego<00:00:03.330> Space<00:00:03.750> Battleship<00:00:04.440> MOC<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.509> based<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.660> on

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
Lego Space Battleship MOC I based it on

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.540 
Lego Space Battleship MOC I based it on
the<00:00:06.899> same<00:00:07.109> color<00:00:07.440> scheme<00:00:07.710> as<00:00:07.770> my<00:00:08.099> oven<00:00:08.429> they<00:00:08.519> go

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the same color scheme as my oven they go

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.600 
the same color scheme as my oven they go
spaceship<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.860> included<00:00:11.190> many

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
spaceship but on this I included many

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
spaceship but on this I included many
more<00:00:11.880> details<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.710> start<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.160> looking

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
more details so let's start by looking

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.210 
more details so let's start by looking
at<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> outside<00:00:17.600> around<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> sides<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.350> you

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
at the outside around the sides here you

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.109 
at the outside around the sides here you
can<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.420> quite<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> few<00:00:22.050> details<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
can see it's got quite a few details and

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.740 
can see it's got quite a few details and
I<00:00:24.119> included<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.099> style<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.630> make

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
I included a lot of this style to make

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.300 
I included a lot of this style to make
it<00:00:27.900> look<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.830> got<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it look like it's got a lot of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.340 
it look like it's got a lot of
components<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.830> features<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> both<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
components and features so it's both the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
components and features so it's both the
same<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.829> both<00:00:35.610> sides<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.300> see

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
same on both sides so you can see

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740 
same on both sides so you can see
there's<00:00:40.200> all<00:00:40.320> sort<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.649> vents

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's all sort of different vents

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
there's all sort of different vents
there's<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:42.989> lasers<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.770> well<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:46.520> around

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
there's some lasers as well and around

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.590 
there's some lasers as well and around
the<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.950> engines<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:53.600> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the back you can see the engines and a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
the back you can see the engines and a
lot<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> details<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.039> battle<00:00:56.430> damage<00:00:56.760> as

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
well around the ship and around the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680 
well around the ship and around the
front<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.140> can<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.770> vents<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.690> a

front you can see some more vents and a
nice<00:01:04.049> curved<00:01:04.379> shape<00:01:06.650> here<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
nice curved shape here you can see the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.810 
nice curved shape here you can see the
control<00:01:09.689> cabin<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> take<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> roof<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
control cabin so if we take the roof of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.440 
control cabin so if we take the roof of
that<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.290> inside<00:01:18.950> here<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> see

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
that we can see inside here you can see

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.830 
that we can see inside here you can see
the<00:01:21.450> pilot<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> controls<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the pilot at the controls of all the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.200 
the pilot at the controls of all the
navigation<00:01:25.560> equipment<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.939> everything

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.510 

so<00:01:35.210> next<00:01:35.570> we<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.930> see<00:01:36.140> inside<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.979> actual

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
so next we can see inside the actual

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.830 
so next we can see inside the actual
main<00:01:37.700> part<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.360> ship<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:41.299> we<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.570> do<00:01:41.690> that

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
main part of the ship and we can do that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.649 
main part of the ship and we can do that
by<00:01:42.110> just<00:01:42.380> removing<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.950> side<00:01:43.190> panels<00:01:47.770> and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
by just removing the side panels and

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.469 
by just removing the side panels and
they<00:01:50.659> reveal<00:01:51.020> our<00:01:51.259> whole<00:01:52.180> interior<00:01:53.180> of

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.149 
they reveal our whole interior of
details<00:01:57.430> surround<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.580> side<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.810> see

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
details surround this side we can see

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.940 
details surround this side we can see
the<00:02:02.259> different<00:02:03.259> areas<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.009> ship<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.800> in

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950

controls and lockers for the engines so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.500 
controls and lockers for the engines so
if<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.690> turn<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> ship<00:02:36.890> around<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:40.390> open<00:02:41.390> up

the other side which can be slightly
tricky<00:02:49.970> sometimes<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:52.010> stops<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.430> from

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
tricky sometimes but it stops it from

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.759 
tricky sometimes but it stops it from
coming<00:02:53.000> off<00:02:53.180> accidentally<00:02:55.630> we<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.810> see<00:02:57.019> other
