this is nakia research center in
cambridge<00:00:11.510> here<00:00:12.259> we're<00:00:12.679> looking<00:00:12.710> at<00:00:13.190> what

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
cambridge here we're looking at what

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.660 
cambridge here we're looking at what
nanotechnology<00:00:14.269> can<00:00:15.080> do<00:00:15.380> for<00:00:15.860> current<00:00:16.490> mobile

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
nanotechnology can do for current mobile

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.060 
nanotechnology can do for current mobile
devices<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:17.420> what<00:00:17.779> future<00:00:18.200> mobile<00:00:18.439> devices

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
devices and what future mobile devices

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.889 
devices and what future mobile devices
nanotech<00:00:19.640> can<00:00:19.849> enable<00:00:25.809> nanomaterials<00:00:26.809> are

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
nanotech can enable nanomaterials are

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.260 
nanotech can enable nanomaterials are
basically<00:00:27.380> very<00:00:27.649> small<00:00:28.399> things<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.029> we

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
basically very small things that we

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.970 
basically very small things that we
think<00:00:29.419> are<00:00:29.540> going<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.809> have<00:00:29.899> a<00:00:29.930> big<00:00:30.259> impact<00:00:30.470> on

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
think are going to have a big impact on

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.030 
think are going to have a big impact on
mobile<00:00:31.939> devices<00:00:32.290> so<00:00:33.290> in<00:00:33.440> terms<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.860> enhancing

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
mobile devices so in terms of enhancing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.030 
mobile devices so in terms of enhancing
existing<00:00:34.580> capabilities<00:00:35.560> but<00:00:36.560> then<00:00:36.740> also

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
existing capabilities but then also

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.790 
existing capabilities but then also
enabling<00:00:37.760> totally<00:00:38.450> new<00:00:38.750> capabilities<00:00:39.590> and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
enabling totally new capabilities and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.040 
enabling totally new capabilities and
new<00:00:39.980> form<00:00:40.280> factors<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.360> let's<00:00:41.570> start<00:00:41.840> with

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
new form factors so let's start with

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.980 
new form factors so let's start with
hydrophobic<00:00:42.920> surfaces<00:00:43.640> so<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.420> think<00:00:44.540> most<00:00:44.900> of

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
hydrophobic surfaces so I think most of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.270 
hydrophobic surfaces so I think most of
us<00:00:45.050> are<00:00:45.200> probably<00:00:45.440> familiar<00:00:45.620> with<00:00:45.890> what<00:00:46.250> a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
us are probably familiar with what a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.520 
us are probably familiar with what a
hydrophobic<00:00:46.790> surfaces<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:47.990> if<00:00:48.140> you've<00:00:48.320> got<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
hydrophobic surfaces so if you've got a

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.460 
hydrophobic surfaces so if you've got a
teflon-coated<00:00:49.660> frying<00:00:50.660> pan<00:00:50.870> at<00:00:50.960> home<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.350> you

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
teflon-coated frying pan at home so you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.319 
teflon-coated frying pan at home so you
know<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:51.890> water<00:00:52.100> really<00:00:52.490> doesn't<00:00:52.970> want<00:00:53.000> to

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
know that water really doesn't want to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.720 
know that water really doesn't want to
stick<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.780> hydrophobic<00:00:54.500> surface<00:00:55.190> okay<00:00:55.670> so

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
stick to hydrophobic surface okay so

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.370 
stick to hydrophobic surface okay so
what<00:00:56.090> we've<00:00:56.239> got<00:00:56.420> here<00:00:56.450> is<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.840> little<00:00:57.050> demo

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
what we've got here is a little demo

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.690 
what we've got here is a little demo
that's<00:00:57.739> going<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:57.980> show<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.310> difference

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
that's going to show you the difference

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.880 
that's going to show you the difference
between<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.120> regular<00:00:59.570> hydrophobic<00:01:00.440> surface

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
between a regular hydrophobic surface

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.869 
between a regular hydrophobic surface
and<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:02.090> superhydrophobic<00:01:02.510> surface<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.699> we

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
and a superhydrophobic surface so if we

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.750 
and a superhydrophobic surface so if we
think<00:01:04.909> about<00:01:05.149> what<00:01:05.689> water<00:01:05.990> does<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.560> a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
think about what water does on a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.610 
think about what water does on a
uncoated<00:01:07.760> surface<00:01:08.240> for<00:01:08.510> instance<00:01:08.540> likely<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
uncoated surface for instance likely the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.310 
uncoated surface for instance likely the
edge<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.479> holder<00:01:11.479> here<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.080> basically

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
edge of the holder here so it basically

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.980 
edge of the holder here so it basically
just<00:01:12.770> wants<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.190> spread<00:01:13.430> around<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:14.030> there<00:01:14.240> so

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
just wants to spread around on there so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.860 
just wants to spread around on there so
now<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:15.350> try<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.650> on<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.610> steel<00:01:17.120> so

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
now if we try it on the on the steel so

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.680 
now if we try it on the on the steel so
this<00:01:18.020> has<00:01:18.170> been<00:01:18.350> coated<00:01:18.620> with<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:20.030> low<00:01:20.240> energy

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this has been coated with a low energy

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.170 
this has been coated with a low energy
material<00:01:21.260> so<00:01:21.710> now<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.580> liquid<00:01:22.790> really

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
material so now that the liquid really

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.030 
material so now that the liquid really
doesn't<00:01:23.479> want<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.659> wet<00:01:23.870> it<00:01:23.900> kind<00:01:24.440> of<00:01:24.500> beads<00:01:24.770> up

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
doesn't want to wet it kind of beads up

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.360 
doesn't want to wet it kind of beads up
like<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.299> will<00:01:26.390> slide<00:01:26.720> around<00:01:27.370> so

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
like that and it will slide around so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.130 
like that and it will slide around so
this<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.760> just<00:01:28.850> kind<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.240> bit<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.420> fun<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:29.990> we

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
this is just kind of a bit of fun so we

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710 
this is just kind of a bit of fun so we
can<00:01:30.260> make<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:31.000> marble<00:01:32.000> maze<00:01:32.210> using

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
can make a marble maze using

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.150 
can make a marble maze using
these<00:01:34.350> materials<00:01:36.410> so<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> next<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.890> I'm

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
these materials so the next thing I'm

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.490 
these materials so the next thing I'm
going<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.340> show<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.910> is<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:40.380> had

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
going to show you then is now we had

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
going to show you then is now we had
some<00:01:40.680> nanostructure<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:42.180> surface

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
some nanostructure to that same surface

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.230 
some nanostructure to that same surface
so<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.710> exactly<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.370> same<00:01:44.610> except<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so this is exactly the same except now

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.820 
so this is exactly the same except now
we've<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:45.840> fine<00:01:46.080> nanostructures

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
we've got some very fine nanostructures

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.100 
we've got some very fine nanostructures
on<00:01:46.980> top<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.480> if<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.660> put<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.900> water

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
on top of it so now if I put the water

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
on top of it so now if I put the water
on<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> behaves<00:01:49.920> much<00:01:50.130> differently<00:01:50.580> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
on here it behaves much differently so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600 
on here it behaves much differently so
it's<00:01:50.970> much<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.300> mobile<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.430> really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
it's much more mobile so it's really

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.420 
it's much more mobile so it's really
difficult<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.210> control<00:01:54.710> much<00:01:55.710> harder<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
difficult to control much harder to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300 
difficult to control much harder to
solve<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.970> maze<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> basically<00:01:59.130> what's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
solve the maze so basically what's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.070 
solve the maze so basically what's
happening<00:01:59.370> here<00:01:59.940> is<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.570> nano

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
happening here is that the nano

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.630 
happening here is that the nano
structures<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.710> trapping<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> thin<00:02:02.340> layer<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
structures are trapping a thin layer of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.900 
structures are trapping a thin layer of
air<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.650> water<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> basically<00:02:05.880> just

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
air and the water is basically just

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.790 
air and the water is basically just
sitting<00:02:06.330> on<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.750> lair<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.290> making<00:02:07.619> very

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
sitting on that a lair it's making very

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.070 
sitting on that a lair it's making very

very mobile it's almost just like a like

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
very mobile it's almost just like a like
a<00:02:10.110> liquid<00:02:10.350> marble<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> why<00:02:12.230> would<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.260> be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a liquid marble and why would you be

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
a liquid marble and why would you be
interested<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.220> terms<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.790> mobile

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.540 
interested in that in terms of a mobile
device<00:02:15.420> well<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.709> put<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.100> over<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
device well if we can put that over the

device well if we can put that over the
electronics<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.690> instance<00:02:19.080> then<00:02:19.410> we've<00:02:19.650> got

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
electronics for instance then we've got

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.560 
electronics for instance then we've got
a<00:02:19.830> good<00:02:20.010> chance<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.550> next<00:02:20.820> time<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> drop<00:02:21.390> it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
a good chance that next time you drop it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.880 
a good chance that next time you drop it
in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> sink<00:02:22.020> or<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.380> bath<00:02:22.590> there's<00:02:22.860> a

good chance that it'll survive because

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.910 
good chance that it'll survive because
the<00:02:24.810> waters<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.800> these

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.840 

what<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.770> demo<00:02:36.160> that's<00:02:36.580> going

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
what we have here is a demo that's going

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
what we have here is a demo that's going
to<00:02:36.910> show<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.120> some<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> these<00:02:37.600> nano

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to show you some of these nano

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.950 
to show you some of these nano
technologies<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.430> we've<00:02:39.610> got<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> phone<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
technologies so we've got a phone so the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.400 
technologies so we've got a phone so the
Lumia<00:02:41.380> 710<00:02:42.010> here<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.640> coated<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:44.320> of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
Lumia 710 here is coated with one of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.740 
Lumia 710 here is coated with one of
these<00:02:44.500> super<00:02:44.830> hydrophobic<00:02:45.430> surfaces<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.630> it's

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
these super hydrophobic surfaces so it's

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.470 
these super hydrophobic surfaces so it's
got<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> nanostructured<00:02:47.440> surface<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.190> there

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
got a nanostructured surface on there

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.700 
got a nanostructured surface on there
what<00:02:49.480> we're<00:02:49.630> going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.290> we're<00:02:50.470> going<00:02:50.590> to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.790 
what we're going to do is we're going to
drop<00:02:51.550> some<00:02:51.880> water<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.960> phone<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.590> going

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
drop some water on the phone it's going

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.700 
drop some water on the phone it's going
to<00:02:53.830> bounce<00:02:54.100> off<00:02:54.660> underneath<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.960> phone<00:02:56.200> here

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
to bounce off underneath the phone here

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.580 
to bounce off underneath the phone here
there's<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.250> transparent<00:02:58.120> sensor<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.440> has

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
there's a transparent sensor so this has

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.070 
there's a transparent sensor so this has
got<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> single<00:03:00.550> atomic<00:03:00.940> layer<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.390> carbon<00:03:01.750> on

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
got a single atomic layer of carbon on

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.230 
got a single atomic layer of carbon on
there<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.650> got<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:02.800> patterned<00:03:03.490> graphene

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
there so it's got a patterned graphene

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.210 
there so it's got a patterned graphene
layer<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.720> been<00:03:04.930> made<00:03:05.140> into<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.620> capacitive

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
layer that's been made into a capacitive

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.670 
layer that's been made into a capacitive
sensor<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.570> that's<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.020> detect<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
sensor so that's going to detect the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280 
sensor so that's going to detect the
droplet<00:03:09.040> impact<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.200> trigger<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
droplet impact and trigger the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.460 
droplet impact and trigger the
high-speed<00:03:11.800> camera<00:03:12.070> here<00:03:12.430> sitting<00:03:12.820> behind<00:03:12.970> it

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
high-speed camera here sitting behind it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.540 
high-speed camera here sitting behind it
okay<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:14.530> let's<00:03:14.890> take<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> look<00:03:15.400> at<00:03:15.520> what

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
okay so let's take a look at what

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.430 
okay so let's take a look at what
happened<00:03:16.090> when<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.360> drop<00:03:16.720> impacted<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
happened when that drop impacted the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.740 
happened when that drop impacted the
super<00:03:17.680> hydrophobic<00:03:18.190> surface<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.330> here's<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
super hydrophobic surface so here's the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.450 
super hydrophobic surface so here's the
slow<00:03:20.020> mo<00:03:20.230> movie<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:23.500> get<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.710> bit<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.890> inertial

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
slow mo movie you get a bit of inertial

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.440 
slow mo movie you get a bit of inertial
spread<00:03:24.850> initially<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.820> then<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.060> surface

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
spread initially and then the surface

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.090 
spread initially and then the surface
tension<00:03:28.870> pulls<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.410> back<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:32.920> do

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
tension pulls it back in so if you do

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.310 
tension pulls it back in so if you do
that<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.610> regular<00:03:34.090> surface<00:03:34.690> on<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.930> movie

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
that on a regular surface on the movie

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.520 
that on a regular surface on the movie
here<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.710> can<00:03:35.860> see<00:03:36.100> basically<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:38.080> droplet

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
here you can see basically the droplet

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.040 
here you can see basically the droplet
will<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.860> stick<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.400> surface<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:40.720> much

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
will just stick to the surface it's much

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.710 
will just stick to the surface it's much
less<00:03:41.530> mobile<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:42.940> case<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.510> things

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
less mobile so in this case the things

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.020 
less mobile so in this case the things
just<00:03:44.050> all<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.650> pretty<00:03:45.160> much<00:03:45.340> all<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.610> waters

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
just all the pretty much all the waters

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.840 
just all the pretty much all the waters
bounced<00:03:46.900> off<00:03:47.050> on<00:03:47.260> impact<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:48.340> not<00:03:48.580> something

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
bounced off on impact it's not something

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.350 
bounced off on impact it's not something
new<00:03:49.209> at<00:03:49.330> all<00:03:49.480> no<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> mean<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:51.400> ever<00:03:51.459> nature<00:03:52.209> has

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.000 
new at all no I mean as ever nature has
already<00:03:52.510> figured<00:03:53.020> out<00:03:53.140> these<00:03:53.380> things<00:03:53.680> it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
already figured out these things it

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.470 
already figured out these things it
works<00:03:54.280> out<00:03:54.430> millions<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.910> years<00:03:55.000> ago<00:03:55.239> three

nanostructured<00:03:59.620> surface<00:04:00.220> which<00:04:00.430> has<00:04:00.610> got

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
nanostructured surface which has got

you<00:04:05.920> combine<00:04:06.310> those<00:04:06.520> two<00:04:06.790> things<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.480> make<00:04:07.630> a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
you combine those two things to make a

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.380 
you combine those two things to make a
kind<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.130> hierarchical<00:04:09.130> structure<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:10.270> is

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
kind of hierarchical structure this is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.120 
kind of hierarchical structure this is
actually<00:04:10.690> really<00:04:10.959> good<00:04:11.110> at<00:04:11.290> resisting<00:04:11.560> water

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
actually really good at resisting water

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.310 
actually really good at resisting water
so<00:04:12.430> things<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.060> lotus<00:04:13.239> leaf<00:04:13.630> also

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
so things like the lotus leaf also

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.310 
so things like the lotus leaf also
things<00:04:14.800> like<00:04:14.890> insect<00:04:15.880> eyes<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.690> wings<00:04:16.930> have

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
things like insect eyes and wings have

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.229 
things like insect eyes and wings have
these<00:04:17.500> kind<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.770> structures<00:04:17.919> on<00:04:18.340> there<00:04:18.640> so

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
these kind of structures on there so

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.340 
these kind of structures on there so
they<00:04:19.480> aggressively<00:04:19.989> repelled<00:04:20.380> water

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
they aggressively repelled water

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770 
they aggressively repelled water
to<00:04:21.560> protect<00:04:21.770> me<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.520> plant<00:04:22.790> or<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.210> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
to protect me the plant or the the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.960 
to protect me the plant or the the
insect<00:04:24.200> ultimately<00:04:25.100> what<00:04:25.370> we're<00:04:25.550> hoping<00:04:25.730> is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
insect ultimately what we're hoping is

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580 
insect ultimately what we're hoping is
that<00:04:26.030> these<00:04:26.330> nano<00:04:26.600> technologies<00:04:27.350> are

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
that these nano technologies are

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.520 
that these nano technologies are
enablers<00:04:27.920> for<00:04:28.280> completely<00:04:29.240> new<00:04:29.450> device<00:04:30.140> form

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
enablers for completely new device form

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.140 
enablers for completely new device form
factors<00:04:31.040> so<00:04:31.280> if<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.490> think<00:04:31.520> about<00:04:31.790> maybe

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
factors so if you think about maybe

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.650 
factors so if you think about maybe
flexible<00:04:32.900> devices<00:04:33.640> bendable<00:04:34.640> devices<00:04:35.390> and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
flexible devices bendable devices and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.150 
flexible devices bendable devices and
ultimately<00:04:36.140> maybe<00:04:36.440> even<00:04:36.710> stretchable

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
ultimately maybe even stretchable

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.670 
ultimately maybe even stretchable
devices
