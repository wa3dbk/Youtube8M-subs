00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
we retrofitted with quartz frets and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.569 
we retrofitted with quartz frets and
it's<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> new<00:00:45.899> dr<00:00:47.570> powder-coated<00:00:48.570> neons

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and then we created a color that we

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
and then we created a color that we
liked<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.479> can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
liked for this one and because we can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
liked for this one and because we can
make<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.229> frets<00:01:16.470> any<00:01:16.710> color<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.280> now

this<00:01:45.689> guitar<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:46.229> were<00:01:46.350> playing<00:01:46.500> live<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this guitar when were playing live and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
this guitar when were playing live and
we<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.240> volume<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:49.079> starts<00:01:49.740> doing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we got some volume it starts doing

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.700 
we got some volume it starts doing
things<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.149> can't<00:01:51.390> explain<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.200> all

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
things that you can't explain and all

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
things that you can't explain and all
the<00:01:52.860> crystals<00:01:53.460> together<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> create<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the crystals together kind of create a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
the crystals together kind of create a
joint<00:01:55.290> chorusing<00:01:56.219> effect<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.659> starts
