00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.990
 two 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.470
 the project who the official review I 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 that would be like charter or charters I do not know 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.020
 and I was working two days and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.130
 putting ends and all that and then the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.869
 streets have no name so medium 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.180
 original but I put white and you know I do not know 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.470
 how to call him but well this test know 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.430
 who finds out how texture 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.880
 but in cinema is a texture is a code 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.610
 that is in aman i khas because it says now 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.220
 there are two new folders that would be one of 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.650
 matter and one of them in the essence of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.680
 one can modify codes add here 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.220
 is whatever and in material they can not 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.570
 I do not know why so much but good 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.850
 science here is the headquarters that is called 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.509
 justice and here says 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.150
 the good thing is that we're going to look for it and 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.830
 is here is this the venues can be 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.229
 combine with textures with which you 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.670
 you want to understand that from the ignition that 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.670
 I did not enter from which none of that can 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.310
 comment it with textures and all that more 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 I'll show you how he combines that but 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.600
 when they take out martials they are barely 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.170
 gone out as it is already night or four but 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.200
 well let's go to a world here I have this 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 so we went in and, as you can see 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.179
 you will notice many different things like 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.630
 they come out and the first thing is that 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.000
 we compose shines pretty yes and what 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.830
 first is that the note is this will be 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 because the sand shines so much I 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.940
 I will respond to that here it is believed that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.570
 this 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.090
 a little reality how to tell 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.570
 I do not know how to explain this shine as 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.570
 if it were in real life it would be sent in 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.220
 desert is all that the sand with that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.619
 it makes a pretty bright glow like 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.450
 it was snow and that's true and I wanted to 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.250
 add it here and I know it could be 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.869
 uncomfortable but how gray and how can you see 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.550
 which also changes quite a lot 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.020
 far it looks like different and here it looks 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.840
 more different also and then if the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.120
 the shine of the sand goes like this but let's go 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.060
 to catch sand 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.159
 in places where the light does not reach because it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.409
 look different as you can see staying in it 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.629
 It looks different depending on where 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.599
 come the light will go catching more 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.129
 shine and as you can see it is taking more 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.500
 brightness is catching more threshing made 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.709
 effectively that's because of the lighting 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.370
 you do not know totally about I'm not that 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 with him and has a tone is 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.909
 pretty cool is that it makes the rows 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.040
 already of the one who says that you see is uncomfortable 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.079
 for some so good and also you 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.480
 improve the lighting a little but what 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.730
 that would be the ciadi all this so 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.129
 let's see what to find a cave 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.819
 we found pretty cool but you can 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:10.310
 cause the house he may know it 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.680
 take a lot of ram many would say I and that's not 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 you can street this way and that already 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.550
 I was testing this 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.560
 I'm trying with the glow of the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.560
 light that I am with the water so that it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.200
 I saw it as if it were that in the water what 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.820
 I did but I grew berman and kraft thanks 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.710
 the wheel and Greece all goes well not 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.060
 I wanted it not to add to these already 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.110
 that same thing so let's try the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 lighting and how can you see the ok 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.210
 it lights up a lot and the blocks look 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.820
 some I think they look more like 15 more 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.070
 I do not know how deep you can see 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.860
 pretty cool and well this is mick 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.170
 jagger well if you like it I do not know 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.209
 maybe there's another one more different from this 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 clear because it 's just add a little bit of 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.170
 shine and a bit of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.290
 it touched us a little elegance I would say 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.920
 because the water looks different and therefore not 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.989
 is different and singh is easy to graph 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.150
 activated let's turn it off you see a 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.420
 more different tone as you can see it looks 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.419
 this is a celestial medium something like that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.919
 to lower the water looks clear below 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.459
 of water is clear depending on what 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.650
 depth of 6 or if you drop more this 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.229
 be the darkest as you get more 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 away from the sun or from the light you will see 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.289
 darker and he wanted to do it like that because if 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.900
 you have to give it a little touch a 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.460
 touch more personality and all that well 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.130
 what can you do and what do you think is a 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 texture is not a texture and if 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.000
 They want to see for yourselves 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.120
 that in addition a texture only have to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.490
 unpack my pack and then 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.500
 you will notice that they have no texture 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.970
 they only have the codes and all that 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.100
 so well I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.760
 this truth subscribe be commented then 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.100
 until next time 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.100
 this west especially bad
