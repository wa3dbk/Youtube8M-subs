00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.089 
and I don't really know I would classify

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.100 
and I don't really know I would classify
it<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.830> for<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.039> or<00:00:14.370> 4p<00:00:14.879> so<00:00:15.539> right<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.869> have

conditioner<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:16.860> hair<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.580> out

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
conditioner in my hair I just got out

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.750 
conditioner in my hair I just got out
the<00:00:17.730> shower<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.310> little

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the shower and I do have a little

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.450 
the shower and I do have a little
wrapping<00:00:21.210> things<00:00:21.359> I'm<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.779> naked<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.500> um<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
wrapping things I'm not naked but um I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.999 
wrapping things I'm not naked but um I
don't<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:25.470> different<00:00:25.710> all

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
don't know it's really different all

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.140 
don't know it's really different all
over<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:26.849> front<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:29.150> doesn't

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
over like in the very front it doesn't

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.780 
over like in the very front it doesn't
really<00:00:30.359> coil<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:31.050> as<00:00:31.320> tightly<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.460> rest<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
really coil up as tightly as the rest of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.380 
really coil up as tightly as the rest of
it<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.180> now<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.430> especially<00:00:36.270> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it does now I think this especially this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
it does now I think this especially this
part<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.260> might<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.160> heat

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
part right here it might have heat

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
part right here it might have heat
damage<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:39.329> I'm<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> was

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
damage because I'm when I was

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.130 
damage because I'm when I was
transitioning<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.270> one<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.539> times<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.930> did

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
transitioning a one or two times I did

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.420 
transitioning a one or two times I did
put<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> weave<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.770> hair<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.070> left<00:00:44.250> some

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
put a weave in my hair and I left some

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.510 
put a weave in my hair and I left some
hair<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.440> flat<00:00:46.440> ironing<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> so

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
hair out and I was flat ironing it so

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
hair out and I was flat ironing it so
yeah<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:50.250> yeah<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:52.079> front

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
yeah but yeah you see this this front

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.029 
yeah but yeah you see this this front
part<00:00:52.680> doesn't<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.370> um<00:00:54.620> curl<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.859> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
part doesn't really um curl like the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
part doesn't really um curl like the
rest<00:00:56.219> does<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
rest does it kind of has like a way to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.860 
rest does it kind of has like a way to
it<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.640> not<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> spiral<00:01:00.989> coil<00:01:01.699> I

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
it but not really like a spiral coil I

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.759 
it but not really like a spiral coil I
think<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> most<00:01:04.199> part<00:01:04.320> though<00:01:04.620> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
think for the most part though the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.770 
think for the most part though the
perimeter<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.519> perimeter<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.300> hair<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
perimeter the perimeter of my hair is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
perimeter the perimeter of my hair is
like<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.009> be<00:01:08.280> um<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.799> coil

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
like for be um because it's really coil

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
like for be um because it's really coil
II<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.049> coils<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.799> clump

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
II but the coils they don't clump

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.520 
II but the coils they don't clump
together<00:01:14.240> like<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.110> back<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.500> my

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
together like they do in the back of my

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.960 
together like they do in the back of my
head<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.310> why<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.000> part<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
head and that's why I think that part is

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
head and that's why I think that part is
maybe<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:24.200> yeah<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> guess<00:01:25.560> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
maybe more for a but yeah I guess this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.960 
maybe more for a but yeah I guess this
is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> part<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.579> will<00:01:26.850> classify<00:01:27.090> them

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
is the part that I will classify them

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.890 
is the part that I will classify them
for<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.079> see

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.680 

is<00:01:34.900> really<00:01:35.290> stretching<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.940> coyly<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.600> you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
is really stretching and coyly and you

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.410 
is really stretching and coyly and you
look<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.080> same<00:01:41.110> over<00:01:41.740> here<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:42.100> don't<00:01:42.400> know<00:01:42.580> I

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
look the same over here I don't know I

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.960 
look the same over here I don't know I
really<00:01:44.290> don't<00:01:44.470> know<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.460> really<00:01:45.790> don't

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
really don't know and I really don't

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.600 
really don't know and I really don't
care<00:01:46.180> either<00:01:46.450> but<00:01:46.900> somebody<00:01:47.320> accident<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.580> i

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
care either but somebody accident so i

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.890 
care either but somebody accident so i
just<00:01:48.880> thought<00:01:49.120> i<00:01:49.150> would<00:01:49.270> show<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.600> guys<00:01:49.840> my

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
just thought i would show you guys my

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.740 
just thought i would show you guys my
hair<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.500> I'm<00:01:50.710> gonna<00:01:51.480> turn<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.950> see

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
hair and I'm gonna turn so you can see

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.490 
hair and I'm gonna turn so you can see
the<00:01:55.750> back<00:01:59.010> and<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:01.630> back<00:02:01.690> like<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.260> said

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
the back and in the back like I said

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.350 
the back and in the back like I said
that's<00:02:02.680> where<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:04.330> most

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
that's where I have like the most

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:19.300 
that's where I have like the most
defined<00:02:05.260> curls<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:06.640> naturally

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.190 

I'm<00:02:19.849> gonna<00:02:20.090> zoom<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.020> don't<00:02:21.170> think

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
I'm gonna zoom because I don't think

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.309 
I'm gonna zoom because I don't think
y'all<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.770> see<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.510> looking<00:02:23.750> at<00:02:23.840> myself<00:02:23.989> on

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
y'all can I see but looking at myself on

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.839 
y'all can I see but looking at myself on
this<00:02:24.440> video<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.860> feel<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.250> my<00:02:25.430> hair<00:02:25.670> is

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
this video I feel like my hair is

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:38.080 
this video I feel like my hair is
growing<00:02:26.470> quite<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> bit<00:02:35.800> okay<00:02:36.800> now<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.730> should

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
growing quite a bit okay now you should

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.089 
growing quite a bit okay now you should
be<00:02:38.120> able<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.780> better<00:02:39.080> picture<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.769> my

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099

maybe<00:03:18.530> classify<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.280> like<00:03:19.519> working<00:03:20.000> too
