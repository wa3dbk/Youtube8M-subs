really appreciate it I do but let's zoom
in<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.239> learn<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.540> one<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.170> we

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
in and learn this one right now here we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.710 
in and learn this one right now here we
go<00:00:46.290> right<00:00:46.589> so<00:00:46.800> primarily<00:00:47.699> you<00:00:48.269> need<00:00:48.449> three

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
go right so primarily you need three

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.450 
go right so primarily you need three
chords<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.409> whole<00:00:49.680> song<00:00:50.040> there's<00:00:50.400> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
chords for the whole song there's a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
chords for the whole song there's a
couple<00:00:50.699> little<00:00:51.110> little<00:00:52.110> tricks<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.530> things

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
couple little little tricks and things

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.469 
couple little little tricks and things
but<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.339> it<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.670> revolves<00:00:54.059> around<00:00:54.150> three

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
but really it just revolves around three

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.490 
but really it just revolves around three
chords<00:00:56.449> three<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.780> sections<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.409> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
chords three different sections where it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.079 
chords three different sections where it
takes<00:00:58.650> those<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.250> chords<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.729> puts<00:00:59.970> them

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
takes those three chords and puts them

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.390 
takes those three chords and puts them
in<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.690> different<00:01:00.720> order<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.070> great

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
in a different order which is a great

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.630 
in a different order which is a great
songwriting<00:01:03.030> tool<00:01:03.330> at<00:01:03.510> least<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> understand

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
songwriting tool at least to understand

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
two down from the G chord and then get

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.450 
two down from the G chord and then get
you<00:02:39.440> know<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> middle<00:02:39.950> finger<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
you know that middle finger on the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.090 
you know that middle finger on the
second<00:02:40.850> fret<00:02:40.880> behind<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> high<00:02:42.020> e<00:02:42.100> 2nd

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
second fret behind it on the high e 2nd

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.910 
second fret behind it on the high e 2nd
fret<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> g<00:02:44.320> behind<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.710> you're<00:02:45.800> going

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
fret on the g behind it and you're going

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.480 
fret on the g behind it and you're going
to<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.570> one<00:02:47.570> strum<00:02:47.960> on<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.290> then<00:02:48.740> pinky<00:02:49.220> comes

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
to go one strum on that then pinky comes

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.130 
to go one strum on that then pinky comes
off

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.940 

then<00:02:53.140> middle<00:02:53.530> finger<00:02:53.829> comes<00:02:54.069> off

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
then middle finger comes off

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:12.920 
then middle finger comes off
and<00:02:56.130> comes<00:02:56.459> back<00:02:56.670> down

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:24.920 

the<00:03:13.930> second<00:03:14.500> time<00:03:15.070> instead<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:18.610> goes<00:03:20.850> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.270 

Gore

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
Gore

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.390 
Gore
so<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.390> alternates<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.110> that's<00:03:29.230> also<00:03:29.470> what

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so it alternates and that's also what

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430 
so it alternates and that's also what
happens<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> verse<00:03:31.660> it's<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.170> intro

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
happens with the verse it's the intro

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.290 
happens with the verse it's the intro
and<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.860> verse

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.720 

you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.399 

now<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.330> saw<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.750> doing<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.080> little<00:03:49.290> bit

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
now you saw I was doing a little bit

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:59.240 
now you saw I was doing a little bit
extra<00:03:49.650> strumming<00:03:50.159> there<00:03:57.680> that's<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.950> pulse

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
extra strumming there that's the pulse

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.640 
extra strumming there that's the pulse
of<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.610> song<00:03:59.849> it<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.329> be<00:04:00.450> varied<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.409> can<00:04:01.560> do

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
of the song it can be varied you can do

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.899 
of the song it can be varied you can do
all<00:04:01.739> kinds<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.040> things<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:02.790> we've

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
all kinds of things with it but we've

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:35.280 
all kinds of things with it but we've
got<00:04:03.120> down<00:04:03.540> down<00:04:03.930> down

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.990 

so<00:04:36.290> it's<00:04:36.470> using<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.830> for<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.220> verse<00:04:37.700> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
so it's using that for the verse and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.480 
so it's using that for the verse and
then<00:04:38.900> finally<00:04:39.470> before<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.890> goes<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.340> next

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
then finally before it goes to the next

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.610 
then finally before it goes to the next
section<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:41.630> does<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> little<00:04:42.170> thing<00:04:42.350> so<00:04:42.560> you

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
section it does a little thing so you

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:51.080 
section it does a little thing so you
got<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.920> verse

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.330 

the<00:04:51.420> fun

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.090 

so<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.270> doesn't<00:04:58.600> build<00:04:58.840> on<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.350> right<00:04:59.950> before

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
so it doesn't build on and right before

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.570 
so it doesn't build on and right before
that<00:05:00.310> it's

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
that it's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.600 
that it's
which<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.630> same<00:05:03.780> thing<00:05:03.990> as<00:05:06.830> but<00:05:07.830> instead

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
which is the same thing as but instead

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.740 
which is the same thing as but instead
of<00:05:08.760> hitting<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.590> note<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.980> G<00:05:11.010> chord

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.690 

before<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.080> next<00:05:16.320> section<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:17.250> bass<00:05:17.430> player

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
before the next section the bass player

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.340 
before the next section the bass player
is<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:18.030> playing<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.480> note<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.050> we<00:05:19.170> just

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
is just playing that note so we just

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.790 
is just playing that note so we just
avoid<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.980> we<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.310> go<00:05:21.440> that's<00:05:22.440> why<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.650> mean

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
avoid that we can go that's why I mean

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.590 
avoid that we can go that's why I mean
we're<00:05:23.040> it's<00:05:23.370> basically<00:05:23.760> three<00:05:24.060> chords<00:05:24.420> but

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
we're it's basically three chords but

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.510 
we're it's basically three chords but
you<00:05:24.750> kind<00:05:24.930> of<00:05:25.080> cheat<00:05:25.890> on<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.190> one<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> little

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
you kind of cheat on this one a little

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.190 
you kind of cheat on this one a little
bit<00:05:26.730> we<00:05:26.880> just<00:05:27.030> want<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.240> go<00:05:28.670> 2nd<00:05:29.670> fret<00:05:30.000> on<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
bit we just want to go 2nd fret on the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.920 
bit we just want to go 2nd fret on the
a-string

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.050 

and<00:05:34.500> an<00:05:34.680> equal

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.730 

okay

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.830 

so<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.949> next<00:05:48.220> section<00:05:48.490> like<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.300> was<00:05:49.630> saying

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
so the next section like I was saying

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840 
so the next section like I was saying
before<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.830> same<00:05:51.040> three<00:05:51.250> chords<00:05:51.520> in<00:05:51.760> a

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
before it's the same three chords in a

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.710 
before it's the same three chords in a
different<00:05:52.180> order

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
different order

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.770 
different order
this<00:05:53.110> time<00:05:53.380> now<00:05:53.620> it's<00:05:53.889> G

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.660 

with<00:05:58.350> that<00:05:58.470> same<00:05:58.710> strumming<00:05:59.100> pattern<00:05:59.400> down

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
with that same strumming pattern down

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.890 
with that same strumming pattern down
down<00:06:00.090> down

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:27.210 

gee

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:40.910 

walking<00:06:27.460> on<00:06:28.230> the<00:06:29.230> final<00:06:29.800> section

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:51.369 

which<00:06:41.920> is<00:06:42.070> funny<00:06:42.250> it's<00:06:42.430> the<00:06:42.520> same<00:06:42.730> as

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:55.369 

maybe<00:06:52.379> REO<00:06:52.889> Speedwagon<00:06:53.699> or<00:06:53.819> something<00:06:54.379> was

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
maybe REO Speedwagon or something was

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.739 
maybe REO Speedwagon or something was
that<00:06:55.650> you<00:06:56.249> can<00:06:56.400> tell<00:06:56.550> me<00:06:56.669> in<00:06:56.729> the<00:06:56.819> comments<00:06:57.240> but

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:57.749 
that you can tell me in the comments but

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.050 
that you can tell me in the comments but
it's<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.379> same<00:06:58.590> thing<00:06:58.770> here<00:06:59.009> on<00:06:59.279> this<00:06:59.849> song

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
it's the same thing here on this song
