00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
thin and it's very heavy so it just goes

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.990

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and also it really adds shitloads of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.210 
and also it really adds shitloads of
volume<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.099> hair<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:12.180> like

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
volume to your hair it's like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.090

the<00:02:14.520> only<00:02:14.730> thing<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.290> said<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.830> quite

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the only thing is as I said it is quite

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.690 
the only thing is as I said it is quite
stripping<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.600> quite<00:02:18.840> drying<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.460> I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
stripping and it is quite drying so I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.360 
stripping and it is quite drying so I
tend<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> use<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.540> only<00:02:21.740> occasionally<00:02:22.740> maybe

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
tend to use it only occasionally maybe

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.730 
tend to use it only occasionally maybe
once<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.090> week<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.750> think<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.350> for

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
once a week because I think that for

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.310 
once a week because I think that for
everyday<00:02:26.190> use<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.030> might<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> bit<00:02:27.750> too<00:02:28.080> much

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
everyday use it might be a bit too much

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.610 
everyday use it might be a bit too much
it's<00:02:29.100> after<00:02:29.310> washing<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:29.790> hair<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.270> towel<00:02:31.200> dry

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
it's after washing my hair I towel dry

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's after washing my hair I towel dry
it<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.850> add<00:02:33.540> some<00:02:34.160> extra<00:02:35.160> conditioner

good condition I still have about that
much<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.660> sort<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.440> regrow<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> cut<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
much to sort of regrow and the cut and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.420 
much to sort of regrow and the cut and
this<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.020> layer<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.650> most<00:03:01.890> damaged

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

hair<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.870> add<00:03:04.820> additional<00:03:05.820> step

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
hair so what I do I add additional step

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.180 
hair so what I do I add additional step
which<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> leaving<00:03:07.140> conditioner<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
which is the leaving conditioner and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.490 
which is the leaving conditioner and
this<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.400> Charles<00:03:08.850> Worthington<00:03:09.540> moisture

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500

this is Charles Worthington moisture
seal<00:03:10.860> leave-in<00:03:11.760> conditioner<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.780> is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
seal leave-in conditioner this is

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.290 
seal leave-in conditioner this is
perfect<00:03:13.710> because<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.280> doesn't<00:03:14.820> weigh<00:03:15.060> your

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
perfect because it doesn't weigh your

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.890 
perfect because it doesn't weigh your
hair<00:03:15.360> down<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.200> doesn't<00:03:16.500> leave<00:03:16.920> them<00:03:17.190> greasy

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
hair down it doesn't leave them greasy

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.980 
hair down it doesn't leave them greasy
it<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.230> helps<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.040> add<00:03:20.430> moisture<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
it just helps to add moisture to it and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.500 
it just helps to add moisture to it and
to<00:03:22.860> comb<00:03:23.190> through<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.700> hair<00:03:23.850> because<00:03:24.330> my<00:03:24.360> hair

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
230 degrees which is great the only

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.590 
230 degrees which is great the only
thing<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.200> be

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
thing is you have to be

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.410 
thing is you have to be
careful<00:04:26.020> when<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.260> apply<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.940> because<00:04:27.940> it

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
careful when you apply it because it

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.850 
careful when you apply it because it
tends<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:30.810> glue<00:04:31.810> your<00:04:31.870> hair<00:04:32.260> together<00:04:32.710> a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
little bit so don't apply too much and

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.970 
little bit so don't apply too much and
again<00:04:36.040> focus<00:04:36.820> mainly<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:38.260> ends<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.920> your

and just add the mousse and I always do
it<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.480> my<00:05:13.960> wet<00:05:14.170> hair<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.710> am<00:05:15.070> NOT<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.430> huge<00:05:15.790> fan<00:05:16.060> of

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
it on my wet hair I am NOT a huge fan of

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.170 
it on my wet hair I am NOT a huge fan of
using<00:05:17.380> mousse<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:18.010> your<00:05:18.250> dry<00:05:18.490> or<00:05:18.850> semi-dry

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
using mousse on your dry or semi-dry

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.110 
using mousse on your dry or semi-dry
hair<00:05:19.750> because<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.410> does<00:05:20.740> tend<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.130> look<00:05:21.550> quite

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
hair because it does tend to look quite

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.950 
hair because it does tend to look quite
fake<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.380> it<00:05:23.500> does<00:05:24.000> sort<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.120> make<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:25.630> how<00:05:25.900> to

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
fake and it does sort of make you how to

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.050 
fake and it does sort of make you how to
stick<00:05:26.350> together<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:27.190> it's<00:05:27.520> like<00:05:27.700> a<00:05:27.820> little

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
stick together and it's like a little

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.530 
stick together and it's like a little
shelf<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:29.140> then<00:05:29.320> I<00:05:29.440> blow-dry<00:05:29.800> my<00:05:30.100> hair<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:30.850> I

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
shelf so then I blow-dry my hair and I

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.840 
shelf so then I blow-dry my hair and I
find<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.500> best<00:05:32.740> way<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.040> do<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.700> to

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
find that the best way to do it is to

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.680 
find that the best way to do it is to
put<00:05:34.180> my<00:05:34.390> head<00:05:34.660> down<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.380> just<00:05:36.370> do<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.180> this<00:05:37.420> way

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
put my head down and just do it this way

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.690 
put my head down and just do it this way
because<00:05:37.900> that<00:05:38.350> helps<00:05:38.770> me<00:05:38.950> to<00:05:38.980> out<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.430> most

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
because that helps me to out the most

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.210 
because that helps me to out the most
volume<00:05:40.470> finally<00:05:41.470> once<00:05:41.680> my<00:05:41.920> hair<00:05:42.100> is

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
volume finally once my hair is

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.090 
volume finally once my hair is
blow-dried<00:05:43.060> I<00:05:43.330> use<00:05:44.050> this<00:05:44.380> Charles<00:05:44.890> Wellington
