00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860
 5 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.610
 Very good at all if kids I 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.349
 someone else than today I came back with a 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.939
 new trick I'm already in poe's house 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.470
 record tricks as well as this is the trick 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.240
 to be in the answers the zombies of 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.949
 kim oberto theme off the map without 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.239
 do any the suites so good what 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.980
 first thing you have to do is come 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.239
 until here lying here to the one of the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.699
 seats and this has to stop me 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.830
 push and pull out here is worth the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 most times you get here dead is worth 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.670
 he put me alive because I had the most 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.769
 luck of the world so good as ya 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.210
 I say most of this one gets dead like that 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.339
 that if he puts you dead they have to gather 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.350
 to your partner I recorded it that way 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.940
 so from a simple touch I was already 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.409
 in here so good na more 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.659
 kids for me this trick is not even 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.129
 easy or difficult is luck is worth depends 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.619
 of how the zombie hits you if you even 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.000
 over you already gets you to the first one and if 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.830
 not because the two touches already get you but 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.780
 he will be dead and he has to revive you 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
 friend and no more kids also os 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.020
 I wanted to say something else explaining 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.240
 some are worth those who see me without the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.609
 partner because I have left the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.750
