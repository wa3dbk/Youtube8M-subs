00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
wanted to see if he was as good as RG

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.600 
wanted to see if he was as good as RG
three<00:00:31.240> if<00:00:31.539> he<00:00:31.720> was<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.590> know<00:00:32.739> I<00:00:33.010> want<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.460> see

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
three if he was you know I want to see

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.549 
three if he was you know I want to see
if<00:00:33.670> he<00:00:33.760> was<00:00:33.910> like<00:00:34.390> he<00:00:34.780> had<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.989> speed<00:00:35.140> like

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
if he was like he had the speed like

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.430 
if he was like he had the speed like
that<00:00:35.770> and<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:36.670> was<00:00:36.940> looking<00:00:37.210> at<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.420> stats<00:00:37.719> EJ

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
that and I was looking at the stats EJ

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.709 
that and I was looking at the stats EJ
Manuel<00:00:38.739> speed<00:00:39.190> isn't<00:00:39.340> 83<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.000> RG<00:00:40.329> threes<00:00:40.570> is

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
Manuel speed isn't 83 and RG threes is

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.190 
Manuel speed isn't 83 and RG threes is
93<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:41.710> RT<00:00:42.219> 3<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.610> better<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:43.210> just<00:00:43.660> wanted<00:00:44.079> to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
93 so RT 3 is better I just wanted to

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.950 
93 so RT 3 is better I just wanted to
see<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.500> new<00:00:44.739> breed<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.550> fast<00:00:46.360> quarterbacks

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
see the new breed of fast quarterbacks

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.299 
see the new breed of fast quarterbacks
now<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.200> don't<00:00:47.350> really<00:00:47.530> like<00:00:47.770> to<00:00:47.920> run<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.219> with

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
now I don't really like to run it with

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.060

quarterbacks<00:00:48.789> that<00:00:49.030> often<00:00:49.450> but<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.350> use<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:50.980> as

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
quarterbacks that often but I use it as

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.709

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
has been a lot of drop pics just like an

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.390 
has been a lot of drop pics just like an
NCAA<00:04:09.069> there<00:04:09.879> was<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.150> lot<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.420> drop<00:04:10.660> picks<00:04:10.900> and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
NCAA there was a lot of drop picks and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.000 
NCAA there was a lot of drop picks and
five<00:04:11.700> not<00:04:12.000> gonna<00:04:12.180> lie<00:04:12.329> I've<00:04:12.659> dropped<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.170> lot<00:04:13.349> my

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
five not gonna lie I've dropped a lot my

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.619 
five not gonna lie I've dropped a lot my
opponents<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.489> dropped<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.819> lot<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.599> think

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
opponents have dropped a lot but I think

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.319 
opponents have dropped a lot but I think
they<00:04:16.169> need<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.410> fix<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.829> cuz<00:04:17.180> you're<00:04:18.180> not

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
they need to fix that cuz you're not

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.849 
they need to fix that cuz you're not
gonna<00:04:18.479> really<00:04:18.870> drop<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.229> lot<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> there's<00:04:19.739> gonna

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
gonna really drop a lot it there's gonna

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.129 
gonna really drop a lot it there's gonna
be<00:04:20.009> one<00:04:20.250> or<00:04:20.280> two<00:04:20.370> drop<00:04:20.820> past<00:04:21.090> dropkicks<00:04:21.930> and

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
be one or two drop past dropkicks and

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.980 
be one or two drop past dropkicks and
like<00:04:22.310> three<00:04:23.310> games<00:04:23.550> total<00:04:23.910> altogether<00:04:24.660> but

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
like three games total altogether but

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.100 
like three games total altogether but
and<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.800> was<00:04:25.979> like<00:04:26.100> three<00:04:26.340> per<00:04:27.240> game<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.810> six

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
and this was like three per game and six

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600 
and this was like three per game and six
minute<00:04:28.440> quarters<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.039> I<00:04:29.070> don't<00:04:29.400> know<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.520> think

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
minute quarters so I don't know I think

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.740 
minute quarters so I don't know I think
they<00:04:29.820> need<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:29.970> fix<00:04:30.210> that

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
they need to fix that

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.300 
they need to fix that
but<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.919> mean<00:04:32.250> that's<00:04:32.370> drop<00:04:33.110> drop<00:04:34.310> interception

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
but I mean that's drop drop interception

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.830 
but I mean that's drop drop interception
so<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.580> mean<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.060> not<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.180> big<00:04:36.509> of<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.690> deal

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
so I mean it's not that big of a deal

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.730 
so I mean it's not that big of a deal
and<00:04:37.080> right<00:04:37.199> there

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
and right there

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.499 
and right there

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
he still has a chance to win he it's 7

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.700 
he still has a chance to win he it's 7
to<00:04:45.330> 21<00:04:45.660> he<00:04:45.900> scored<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.169> touchdown<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:46.680> a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
to 21 he scored a touchdown it's a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.360 
to 21 he scored a touchdown it's a

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
the run game and right here I'm

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.999 
the run game and right here I'm
scrambling<00:06:09.690> right<00:06:10.139> with<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.440> Jamie<00:06:10.770> and

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
scrambling right with you Jamie and

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.879 
scrambling right with you Jamie and
he<00:06:11.550> comes<00:06:12.509> up<00:06:12.719> and<00:06:12.839> I<00:06:12.930> showed<00:06:13.379> it<00:06:13.499> to<00:06:13.529> my<00:06:13.589> tight

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
he comes up and I showed it to my tight

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.879 
he comes up and I showed it to my tight
end<00:06:13.919> for<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.849> touchdown<00:06:15.089> and<00:06:15.919> on<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.729> kickoff

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
end for the touchdown and on the kickoff

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.100 
end for the touchdown and on the kickoff
he<00:06:19.889> really<00:06:20.159> gets<00:06:20.309> him<00:06:20.430> nowhere<00:06:20.610> so<00:06:21.149> I<00:06:21.210> guess<00:06:21.869> he
