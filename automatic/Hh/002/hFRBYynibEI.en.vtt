00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 I know very well what to tell you at this time 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.120
 there are minutes left for the biggest battle of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 our lives as professionals all 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.529
 is summarized to today or we consecrate ourselves as 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.720
 team we do not stay where we are 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 play by play centimeter to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 centimeter until the final whistle we're 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 still in cross and every vital we can 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.539
 stay there and they take out the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.360
 shit we can not fight for our 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.500
 way back to honor we can 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 get out of this hell are you 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 they can do it they are the only owners of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.950
 your future no one else than you can 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.469
 make this story a legend 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.860
 to recover our honor that of you the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.670
 of the people you know very well the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 life gives you and takes away that is part of the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 life but you only assume it when you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.080
 remove those things that hurt you and you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.170
 realize that life is only 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 a game of centimeters and so is the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.200
 football because in any game in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.380
 life or in football the margin of error 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 it's very small half passed late to a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.110
 advance and you lose a microsecond very 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.660
 slow very fast and you can not get there 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.300
 all those centimeters that we need 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.330
 be there on the court to be in each 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.990
 moment of the game in each minute in each 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 second in this team we fight for each 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.390
 piece of court in this team we 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 we kill every inch by removing the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.720
 rival because we know that if we add 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.810
 all those centimeters that's going to be the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 point difference between winning and losing 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.380
 between living or dying between staying in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 shadow or recover the category I will tell you 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.340
 something else in any fight who is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.070
 willing to die is who wins his place 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 and I know that if they are willing to live 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.440
 it's because they're still willing to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.170
 fight and die on the court for that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.170
 centimeter that we lack because that is 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.700
 what it means to live being willing to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.700
 die for what one had 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.130
 we have fought a year to recover 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.400
 our respect we are a team with 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.070
 story that you should not be where it is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's return the joy to our people 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.140
 to us to our children now now 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.140
 I can not force them to do it alone 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.570
 Just look at your classmates 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.210
 look them in the eyes and you will see a man 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.240
 willing to run every inch of the 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.830
 court for you look at them and grant a 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 man who is willing to die for 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.460
 this team because he knows that you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.150
 they will do the same for him that's a team 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.670
 boys because we win now as a 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.420
 team we do not get lost in the shadows 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.530
 as individuals that is soccer gentlemen 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.530
 that's all it is
