00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.050
 stop knocking on clave knocking on 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 hello everyone hi with you alexander 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.619
 drake 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.670
 and we start a new video series 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.670
 Pocket chips for and type 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.719
 us three big pizzas one spicy 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.820
 one Bulgarian and let's and let's and 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.489
 let's get one more little one 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.290
 delicious today we will break down 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:24.729
 which can be added to the rhythm and 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:26.470
 the ripple of the eighth notes the rhythms of the ripple 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:34.240
 eighth notes appear in binary code 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 thus 10 and 1 and 0 and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.700
 that is, all kinds we can 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:58.239
 count 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 so consider come to 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:04.840
 him the first break sounds very stupidly very 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:12.569
 just everything we love it just 8 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.569
 beats on snare 10 10 10 10 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.439
 If you are a technician, this means that you can 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.680
 it is therefore very important to start 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:46.379
 by 1 and end by 1 next clock 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.069
 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and if you scatter this idea 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:03:04.440
 on drums 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:03:11.569
 will be a little more interesting in binary 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.569
 Code it looks like this 10 10 10 10 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.060
 next possible option when we 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.250
 play 4 hits on snare and 2 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.250
 hitting the first volume 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 slow 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:25.720
 again I remind you it is very important to consider 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:27.490
 yourself 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 1 another option 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.030
 how can you scatter 8 strokes 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.400
 drums 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.000
 play at the same time on the snare and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 on the floor to me 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.679
 sounds a bit boring but if 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:55.539
 make a crescendo this gradually 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:05:15.369
 the rise of the dynamics will be much 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:17.529
 more interesting it was the drum guns for 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:19.119
 and guts and if you liked this video
