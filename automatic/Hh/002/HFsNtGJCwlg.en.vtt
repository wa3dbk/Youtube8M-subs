00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.810 
I've got a friend of mine who used to
work<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.720> certain<00:01:49.530> job<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.159> required<00:01:50.579> him<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
work a certain job it required him to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
work a certain job it required him to
take<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.270> urine<00:01:51.630> test<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> time<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
take a urine test at the time I was

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.050 
take a urine test at the time I was
taking<00:01:53.189> quite<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> whey<00:01:54.030> protein

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
taking quite a lot of whey protein

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
taking quite a lot of whey protein
probably<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:54.990> than<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> should<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
probably more than you should do and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.219 
probably more than you should do and
they<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.240> his<00:01:57.390> urine<00:01:57.600> test<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.930> said<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.140> was

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
they in his urine test they said it was

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
they in his urine test they said it was
fine<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.439> had<00:01:58.710> no<00:01:58.829> problems<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.729> very

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
fine you had no problems but it was very

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
fine you had no problems but it was very
very<00:02:00.119> high<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.659> protein<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.380> effectively<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
very high in protein so effectively is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
very high in protein so effectively is
taking<00:02:02.820> his<00:02:02.939> whey<00:02:03.030> protein<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:04.140> we're<00:02:04.409> all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
taking his whey protein and is we're all

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.319 
taking his whey protein and is we're all
out<00:02:04.829> okay<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.670> need<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> bear<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.210> mind

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
out okay you need to bear in mind

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
out okay you need to bear in mind
obviously<00:02:06.810> whey<00:02:07.320> protein<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> those<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
obviously whey protein and those kind of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.080 
obviously whey protein and those kind of
protein

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
protein is mixed up living else so it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.050

kind of products our body absorbs it
very<00:02:18.750> very<00:02:18.900> quickly<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.069> take<00:02:20.250> any

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
very very quickly and if you take any

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.369 
very very quickly and if you take any
more<00:02:20.610> than<00:02:20.670> about<00:02:21.000> probably<00:02:21.540> 20<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:21.900> 30<00:02:22.170> grams

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
more than about probably 20 or 30 grams

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.949 
more than about probably 20 or 30 grams
in<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.739> go<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> flush<00:02:24.840> straight

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
in one go it's going to flush straight

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.619 
in one go it's going to flush straight
through<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.620> take<00:02:26.280> small<00:02:26.459> amounts<00:02:27.090> spread<00:02:27.510> out

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
through so take small amounts spread out

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.240 
through so take small amounts spread out
throughout<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.930> day<00:02:28.019> don't<00:02:28.560> go<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.040> big

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
throughout the day don't go for one big

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.890 
throughout the day don't go for one big
hit<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.549> go<00:02:29.849> because<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.269> body<00:02:30.420> simply

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
hit in one go because your body simply

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.539 
hit in one go because your body simply
can't<00:02:31.200> handle<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.129> I<00:02:32.160> said<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.489> you

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
can't handle it but like I said if you

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.309 
can't handle it but like I said if you
do<00:02:32.730> don't<00:02:33.420> panic<00:02:33.750> you're<00:02:33.900> probably<00:02:34.110> just

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
do don't panic you're probably just

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.080 
do don't panic you're probably just
going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> wear<00:02:34.709> out<00:02:34.739> now<00:02:35.549> lots<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
going to wear out now lots of the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.240 
going to wear out now lots of the
negative<00:02:36.569> connotations<00:02:37.260> associated<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
negative connotations associated with a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.270 
negative connotations associated with a
high<00:02:38.400> protein<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:39.060> high<00:02:39.239> way<00:02:39.450> protein<00:02:39.720> diet

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
high protein or high way protein diet

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.940 
high protein or high way protein diet
came<00:02:41.280> from<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.700> study<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.360> 2010<00:02:43.200> which

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
came from a study in 2010 which

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.580 
came from a study in 2010 which
concluded<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.870> protein<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.049> whey<00:02:46.170> protein

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
concluded that protein or whey protein

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.280 
concluded that protein or whey protein
story<00:02:46.860> supplements<00:02:47.430> were<00:02:47.690> very<00:02:48.690> high<00:02:48.959> in

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
story supplements were very high in

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620 
story supplements were very high in
certain<00:02:50.250> metals<00:02:50.579> things<00:02:50.849> like<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.299> think<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
certain metals things like I think it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.729 
certain metals things like I think it
was<00:02:51.750> arsenic<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> lead

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
was arsenic and lead

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.140 
was arsenic and lead
which<00:02:53.250> obviously<00:02:53.400> you're<00:02:53.700> not<00:02:53.819> meant<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.060> be

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
which obviously you're not meant to be

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.960 
which obviously you're not meant to be
consuming<00:02:54.629> too<00:02:54.780> much<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.549> yeah<00:02:56.730> their

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
consuming too much of so yeah their

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
consuming too much of so yeah their
conclusion<00:02:57.540> was<00:02:57.660> they're<00:02:57.900> high<00:02:58.079> not<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.530> you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
conclusion was they're high not and you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.229 
conclusion was they're high not and you
can<00:02:58.709> live<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.160> everyone<00:02:59.640> panicked<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.120> said

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
can live and everyone panicked and said

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.520 
can live and everyone panicked and said
I<00:03:00.360> shouldn't<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.959> these<00:03:01.110> things<00:03:01.290> ever

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I shouldn't be in these things ever

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.210 
I shouldn't be in these things ever
they're<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.129> bad<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.610> however<00:03:03.510> what

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
they're really bad for you however what

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.460 
they're really bad for you however what
study<00:03:05.220> citizen<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.819> shown<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.140> this

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
study the 2010 one firstly they were

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
study the 2010 one firstly they were
given<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.260> participants<00:03:10.769> far<00:03:11.040> too<00:03:11.340> much<00:03:11.519> whey

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
given the participants far too much whey

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.610 
given the participants far too much whey
protein<00:03:12.120> once<00:03:12.329> they<00:03:12.450> were<00:03:12.540> having<00:03:12.780> much<00:03:13.380> more

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
protein once they were having much more

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.199 
protein once they were having much more
or<00:03:13.889> much<00:03:14.069> more<00:03:14.459> protein<00:03:14.880> than<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.090> would

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
or much more protein than you would

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.699 
or much more protein than you would
normally<00:03:15.359> recommend<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.079> us<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> first<00:03:16.560> thing

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
normally recommend to us the first thing

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.220 
normally recommend to us the first thing
the<00:03:17.310> second<00:03:17.670> thing<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.940> when<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.780> tested

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
the second thing was when they tested

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.860 
the second thing was when they tested
other<00:03:19.489> food<00:03:20.489> products<00:03:20.880> they<00:03:21.329> found<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.720> they

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
other food products they found that they

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.509 
other food products they found that they
were<00:03:21.900> higher<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.260> these<00:03:22.650> things<00:03:22.889> then<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
were higher in these things then the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.430 
were higher in these things then the
protein<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.239> they<00:03:24.840> said<00:03:25.109> that<00:03:25.319> whey

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
protein was so they said that whey

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280 
protein was so they said that whey
protein<00:03:25.859> was<00:03:25.980> high<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.489> arsenic<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.540> lead<00:03:27.569> but

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
protein was high in arsenic and lead but

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.809 
protein was high in arsenic and lead but
then<00:03:28.380> they<00:03:28.500> tested<00:03:28.889> things<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.549> think<00:03:29.609> it

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
then they tested things like I think it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.360 
then they tested things like I think it
was<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.030> beans<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:31.470> tuna<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.160> bread

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
was like beans or like tuna and bread

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
was like beans or like tuna and bread
and<00:03:32.519> stuff<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.970> they<00:03:33.359> found<00:03:33.599> they<00:03:33.959> were<00:03:34.019> also

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
and stuff and they found they were also

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.289 
and stuff and they found they were also
high<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.920> lasting<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.280> lived<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.579> some<00:03:36.060> cases

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
high and lasting it lived in some cases

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.530 
high and lasting it lived in some cases
higher<00:03:36.630> than<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> whey<00:03:36.989> protein<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.680> although

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
higher than the whey protein so although

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.759 
higher than the whey protein so although
yeah<00:03:39.540> there<00:03:39.690> was<00:03:39.870> arsenic<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.530> later<00:03:40.650> than

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
yeah there was arsenic and later than

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.440 
yeah there was arsenic and later than
those<00:03:40.859> metals<00:03:41.250> present<00:03:41.459> basically<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
those metals present basically the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.089 
those metals present basically the
conclusion<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.470> present<00:03:43.919> in<00:03:43.980> always

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
conclusion is that is present in always

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.099 
conclusion is that is present in always
everything<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.579> eat<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.359> unless<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:45.959> going

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
everything we eat so unless you're going

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.050 
everything we eat so unless you're going
crazy<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.799> said<00:03:47.010> me<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> know<00:03:47.489> pounds

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
crazy like I said me and you know pounds

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.059 
crazy like I said me and you know pounds
and<00:03:48.209> pounds<00:03:48.389> of<00:03:48.660> protein<00:03:48.870> each<00:03:49.109> day<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.919> don't

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
and pounds of protein each day you don't

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.740 
and pounds of protein each day you don't
need<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.340> worry<00:03:50.489> about<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.880> now<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.510> only

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
need to worry about it now the only

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.930 
need to worry about it now the only
couple<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.319> things<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.769> warnings<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.730> would

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
couple of things that warnings are would

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.830 
couple of things that warnings are would
sound<00:03:54.239> off<00:03:55.019> firstly<00:03:56.329> when<00:03:57.329> they're<00:03:57.510> making

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
sound off firstly when they're making

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.240 
sound off firstly when they're making
these<00:03:57.959> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.290> protein<00:03:58.650> supplements

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
these kind of protein supplements

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.390 
these kind of protein supplements
sometimes<00:04:00.239> they<00:04:00.660> they<00:04:01.079> treat<00:04:01.829> them<00:04:01.950> with<00:04:02.040> acid

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
sometimes they they treat them with acid

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.770 
sometimes they they treat them with acid
that's<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.639> way<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:02.880> kind<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.150> separate<00:04:03.599> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
that's the way they kind of separate the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.020 
that's the way they kind of separate the
the<00:04:04.019> way<00:04:04.230> out<00:04:04.560> from<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.010> milk<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.609> stuff<00:04:05.819> so

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
the way out from the milk and stuff so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.059 
the way out from the milk and stuff so
they<00:04:06.180> use<00:04:06.359> acid<00:04:06.840> treatment<00:04:07.019> which<00:04:07.739> obviously

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
they use acid treatment which obviously

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.589 
they use acid treatment which obviously
is<00:04:08.310> not<00:04:08.489> great<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.849> don't<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.150> consuming

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
is not great you don't to be consuming

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.970 
is not great you don't to be consuming
these<00:04:09.780> kind<00:04:10.109> of

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
these kind of

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610 
these kind of
get<00:04:11.069> acid<00:04:11.400> products<00:04:11.700> basically<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.620> is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
get acid products basically so that is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.470 
get acid products basically so that is
that<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.010> basically<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.580> much<00:04:14.849> much<00:04:15.060> cheaper

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
that is basically a much much cheaper

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.680 
that is basically a much much cheaper
way<00:04:15.629> for<00:04:15.989> them<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.829> produce<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.310> protein<00:04:17.690> so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
way for them to produce the protein so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.129 
way for them to produce the protein so
all<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.560> would<00:04:19.889> say<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.100> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.729> see<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.630> whey

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
all I would say is if you see a whey

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.870 
all I would say is if you see a whey
protein<00:04:22.530> or<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> protein<00:04:22.919> supplement<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.699> seems

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
protein or a protein supplement it seems

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.480 
protein or a protein supplement it seems
to<00:04:24.030> be<00:04:24.260> stupidly<00:04:25.260> cheap<00:04:25.590> there's<00:04:26.100> probably<00:04:26.400> a

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
to be stupidly cheap there's probably a

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.920 
to be stupidly cheap there's probably a
reason<00:04:26.550> for<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.060> right<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.360> I'll<00:04:27.449> just<00:04:27.720> be<00:04:27.900> a

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
reason for that right so I'll just be a

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.170 
reason for that right so I'll just be a
bit<00:04:28.169> I'll<00:04:28.530> sound<00:04:28.800> word<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.190> caution<00:04:29.400> don't

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
bit I'll sound word of caution don't

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.750 
bit I'll sound word of caution don't
think<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.720> know<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.470> ten<00:04:32.280> pounds<00:04:32.669> of

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
think I know this this ten pounds of

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.340 
think I know this this ten pounds of
protein<00:04:32.940> up<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.330> get<00:04:33.449> for<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:33.720> two<00:04:33.960> dollars

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
protein up and get for like two dollars

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.650 
protein up and get for like two dollars
or<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.740> know<00:04:34.830> five<00:04:35.190> pounds<00:04:35.669> that's<00:04:36.300> probably

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
or you know five pounds that's probably

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.360 
or you know five pounds that's probably
because<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.169> it's<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.860> wrong<00:04:38.040> bit<00:04:38.250> right

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
because it's it's that wrong bit right

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.010 
because it's it's that wrong bit right
so<00:04:38.550> don't<00:04:38.820> automatically<00:04:39.630> assume<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so don't automatically assume the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.689 
so don't automatically assume the
cheapest<00:04:40.350> ones<00:04:40.500> at<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.680> best<00:04:40.860> however<00:04:41.490> maybe

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
cheapest ones at the best however maybe

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.360 
cheapest ones at the best however maybe
you<00:04:41.850> can<00:04:42.060> find<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.419> decent<00:04:42.600> bargain<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:44.039> it's<00:04:44.220> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
you can find a decent bargain and it's a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.010 
you can find a decent bargain and it's a
you<00:04:44.729> know<00:04:44.760> good<00:04:45.060> quality<00:04:45.180> products<00:04:45.660> by<00:04:45.960> all

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
you know good quality products by all

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.080 
you know good quality products by all
means<00:04:46.289> go<00:04:46.470> for<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.370> other<00:04:47.639> word<00:04:47.940> of

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
means go for it the other word of

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.580 
means go for it the other word of
warning<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:48.780> obviously<00:04:49.080> if<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.410> are

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
warning is that obviously if you are

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.610 
warning is that obviously if you are
daring<00:04:50.160> or<00:04:50.310> lactose<00:04:50.789> intolerant<00:04:51.510> then<00:04:51.870> again

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
daring or lactose intolerant then again

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.870 
daring or lactose intolerant then again
the<00:04:52.860> whey<00:04:52.979> protein<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.460> not<00:04:53.580> going<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.760> be<00:04:53.850> a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
the whey protein is not going to be a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.939 
the whey protein is not going to be a
good<00:04:54.060> move<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.539> obviously<00:04:55.530> check<00:04:55.770> for

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
good move so obviously check for

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.439 
good move so obviously check for
allergies<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.520> stuff<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.060> check<00:04:57.330> you

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
allergies and stuff and check you

give you you know all these illnesses
and<00:05:31.530> almost<00:05:32.220> all<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.639> time<00:05:32.820> it<00:05:33.060> turns<00:05:33.270> out<00:05:33.510> to

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
and almost all the time it turns out to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.170 
and almost all the time it turns out to
be<00:05:33.750> completely<00:05:34.620> complete<00:05:35.250> misinformation<00:05:35.639> or

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
be completely complete misinformation or

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.240 
be completely complete misinformation or
they<00:05:36.630> found<00:05:36.930> some<00:05:37.200> tiny<00:05:37.560> little<00:05:37.770> correlation

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
they found some tiny little correlation

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.760 
they found some tiny little correlation
which<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.669> reality<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:39.500> utterly<00:05:40.500> irrelevant

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
which in reality is utterly irrelevant

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.920 
which in reality is utterly irrelevant
so<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:42.090> need<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.330> set<00:05:42.450> these<00:05:42.539> things<00:05:42.720> with<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
so you need to set these things with a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.770 
so you need to set these things with a
pinch<00:05:43.110> of<00:05:43.200> salt<00:05:43.260> it<00:05:44.160> tends<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.910> be<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.240> other

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
pinch of salt it tends to be the other

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.080 
pinch of salt it tends to be the other
people<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.200> say<00:05:46.349> whey<00:05:46.950> protein<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.760> really

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
people that say whey protein is really

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.029 
people that say whey protein is really
bad<00:05:48.360> few<00:05:48.630> are<00:05:49.050> probably<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.500> same<00:05:49.530> people<00:05:49.830> to

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
bad few are probably the same people to

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.469 
bad few are probably the same people to
say<00:05:50.220> that<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.550> shouldn't<00:05:50.880> you<00:05:51.240> shouldn't
