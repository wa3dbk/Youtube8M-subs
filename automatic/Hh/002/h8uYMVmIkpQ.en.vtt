so<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.439> thought<00:00:01.680> thought<00:00:01.949> I'd<00:00:02.040> take<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.310> look<00:00:02.520> at

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so I thought thought I'd take a look at

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.410 
so I thought thought I'd take a look at
this<00:00:04.460> oil<00:00:05.460> filter<00:00:05.670> off<00:00:05.940> my<00:00:06.150> l1<00:00:07.140> honda<00:00:08.099> CBR<00:00:08.490> it's

this oil filter off my l1 honda CBR it's
your<00:00:09.660> standard<00:00:10.620> honda<00:00:11.550> oil<00:00:11.759> filter<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.530> hadn't

taken<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:14.009> part<00:00:14.280> before<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.759> thought<00:00:14.910> I'd

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
taken one part before so I thought I'd

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.330 
taken one part before so I thought I'd
take<00:00:15.179> peek<00:00:15.450> inside

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.060 

pretty<00:00:20.340> standard<00:00:20.550> filter<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> most<00:00:21.510> part

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.250 
rubber silicone and T drain back valve
it<00:00:28.019> seems<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> pretty<00:00:28.890> pliable<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> ran

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it seems to be pretty pliable and ran

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.290 
it seems to be pretty pliable and ran
for<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.920> five<00:00:32.820> six<00:00:33.239> thousand<00:00:33.739> kilometers

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
for about five six thousand kilometers

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.610 
for about five six thousand kilometers
with<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.620> on<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.920> ten<00:00:38.430> forty<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> summer

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
with the on at ten forty in the summer

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.810 
with the on at ten forty in the summer
time<00:00:40.829> obviously<00:00:42.649> it's<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:45.739> steel<00:00:46.820> center

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
time obviously it's about steel center

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
time obviously it's about steel center
tube<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:49.020> good<00:00:49.200> shape

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
tube in good shape

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
tube in good shape
rather<00:00:50.280> than<00:00:50.520> where<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> hit<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
rather than where I hit it with a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
rather than where I hit it with a
screwdriver<00:00:52.850> but<00:00:55.100> seem<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.280> held<00:00:56.789> up

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
screwdriver but seem to have held up

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.209 
screwdriver but seem to have held up
pretty<00:00:57.149> well

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
pretty well

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.410 
pretty well
one<00:00:59.219> thing<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.699> odd<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> took<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
one thing was a little odd and I took it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.520 
one thing was a little odd and I took it
apart<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:04.939> there's<00:01:05.939> no<00:01:06.150> end<00:01:06.390> caps<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
apart the there's no end caps on the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
apart the there's no end caps on the
filter<00:01:07.860> element<00:01:09.170> which<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.320> wasn't<00:01:10.590> used<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
filter element which I wasn't used to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.440 
filter element which I wasn't used to
seeing<00:01:16.159> they're<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.880> felt

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
seeing they're just these kind of felt

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.770 
seeing they're just these kind of felt
like<00:01:19.070> things<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> weird

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
like things so that was kind of weird

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
like things so that was kind of weird
cuz<00:01:22.020> usually<00:01:22.140> there's<00:01:22.439> either<00:01:22.590> paper<00:01:22.830> or

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
cuz usually there's either paper or

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
cuz usually there's either paper or
metal<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.670> something<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:25.320> either<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.619> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
metal or something but it's either to be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.929 
metal or something but it's either to be
built<00:01:25.890> pretty<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:26.310> there's<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
built pretty well there's not a lot of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.800 
built pretty well there's not a lot of
extra<00:01:27.119> glue<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:29.369> there

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
extra glue it's a little bit right there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.120 
extra glue it's a little bit right there
on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.380> end<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:33.020> pleats<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:35.030> pretty<00:01:36.030> even

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
on the end but pleats are pretty even

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
on the end but pleats are pretty even
the<00:01:38.130> lowest<00:01:38.369> part<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:39.840> where<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> hit<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> with

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the lowest part just where I hit it with

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
the lowest part just where I hit it with
the<00:01:40.590> screwdriver<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.700> how<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> looked

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the screwdriver is on how it looked

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
the screwdriver is on how it looked
before<00:01:43.170> hand<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.030> uneven<00:01:45.299> there

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
before hand it's a little uneven there

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.120 
before hand it's a little uneven there
but<00:01:46.280> that's<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> scene<00:01:49.189> seems<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.310> be

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
but that's the scene seems to be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.550 
but that's the scene seems to be
pretty<00:01:52.729> strong<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:53.540> yeah<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.259> little<00:01:54.439> odd

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
pretty strong but yeah just a little odd

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
pretty strong but yeah just a little odd
with<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:55.659> these<00:01:56.659> endcaps

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
with these these endcaps

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.499 
with these these endcaps
doesn't<00:01:59.810> seem<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.110> have<00:02:00.200> hurt<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.509> like

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
doesn't seem to have hurt for the like

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.620 
doesn't seem to have hurt for the like
the<00:02:02.630> time<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.840> had<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.320> there<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:04.630> don't

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the time I had it on there but I don't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.700 
the time I had it on there but I don't
know<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.869> guess<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.140> was<00:02:06.229> expecting<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.649> little

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
know I guess I was expecting a little

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.190 
know I guess I was expecting a little
bit<00:02:06.829> more<00:02:06.950> from<00:02:07.250> Honda<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:10.540> nice<00:02:11.540> coil<00:02:11.900> spring

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
bit more from Honda and nice coil spring

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.970 
bit more from Honda and nice coil spring

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
for the bypass valve in working order

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.930 
for the bypass valve in working order
neat<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.069> leaf<00:02:19.370> spring<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.760> keep

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
neat little leaf spring you keep

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.800 
neat little leaf spring you keep
