top of the page there is a slower option
but<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> apparently<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.570> has<00:00:45.750> coverage<00:00:46.559> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
but it apparently it has coverage in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
but it apparently it has coverage in
more<00:00:46.920> remote<00:00:47.100> locations<00:00:47.969> whereas<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
more remote locations whereas that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
more remote locations whereas that
high-speed<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> bottom<00:00:50.250> doesn't

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
high-speed one at the bottom doesn't

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
high-speed one at the bottom doesn't
quite<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> coverage<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.399> company

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
quite have the coverage so the company

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010 
quite have the coverage so the company
told<00:00:53.969> us<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> young<00:00:54.539> somewhere<00:00:54.840> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
told us you have young somewhere really

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020

isolated<00:00:55.649> use<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> slow<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.000> going

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
isolated use the slow one so we're going

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
isolated use the slow one so we're going
whew<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> select<00:00:58.140> reasonably<00:00:58.530> isolated<00:00:59.039> places

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
whew I select reasonably isolated places

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
whew I select reasonably isolated places
but<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.180> went<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> faster<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but we went for the faster one and it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280

day<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.970> went<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.240> these<00:01:51.479> guys<00:01:51.750> because

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
day we went with these guys because

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100 
day we went with these guys because
they're<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.509> second<00:01:54.509> cheapest<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
they're the the second cheapest but the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
they're the the second cheapest but the
best<00:01:55.350> service<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> still<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:57.149> really

best service and still really really

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.539 
best service and still really really
competitive<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.200> mean<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.159> less<00:01:59.520> than

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
competitive I mean it was less than

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.270 
competitive I mean it was less than
about<00:02:00.000> five<00:02:00.210> dollars<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> day

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
about five dollars a day

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
about five dollars a day
and<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.670> turns<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> post<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and it turns up in the post there it is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.520 
and it turns up in the post there it is
we<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.950> smaller<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:06.110> never<00:02:07.110> used<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
we have smaller this never used one of

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.990 
we have smaller this never used one of
these<00:02:07.680> before<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.399> quite<00:02:08.610> surprised

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
these before so we were quite surprised

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
these before so we were quite surprised
how<00:02:09.119> small<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.569> absolutely<00:02:10.140> amazing<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
how small it was absolutely amazing and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
how small it was absolutely amazing and
you<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.129> put<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.489> pocket<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you just put it in your pocket the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.850 
you just put it in your pocket the
battery<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> leave<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> turned

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
battery if you leave it turned

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.190 
battery if you leave it turned
on<00:02:13.980> works<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.330> battery<00:02:15.870> life's<00:02:16.050> about

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
on works about the battery life's about

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
on works about the battery life's about
eight<00:02:16.410> hours<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.740> day<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.270> about

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
eight hours a day and I think it's about

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.120 
eight hours a day and I think it's about
if<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.780> standby<00:02:19.050> life<00:02:19.500> double<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
if you put on standby life double that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.440 
if you put on standby life double that
or<00:02:20.280> something<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:20.910> if<00:02:20.970> you're<00:02:21.090> using<00:02:21.270> a
