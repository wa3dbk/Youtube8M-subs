00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 very good how are you welcome to a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
 new video today let's see how to play 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 At the touch, let's start with the first 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.700
 that is the team there is no 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.950
 training that you say this is the good 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
 to play the touch we simply have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 to take a training with which we 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 feel comfortable and give us confidence 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 both in attack and in defense because 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 the key will be in the players that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.039
 we are going to put in the center 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.590
 of the field that they have to be players 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.840
 with good pass good control of the ball and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 good dribble in addition if they complement it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 with a good defense we are going to make a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 very balanced midfield and that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 is key to playing the chosen touch 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.360
 from mediocentros to modric is already vast and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.950
 geri a little more ahead of toni kroos 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 that besides having everything I said 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 previously he also has a very good 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 shot so this midfield me 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.199
 I loved the team I took it from 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 a post that put a fantastic end I suppose 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.770
 that you will know all by twitter and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 here is the team with arda turan in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 left band a full-fledged gamers 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.770
 müller on the right band and also if 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.420
 we can also complement it with some 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 laterals that support the attack as 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.510
 marcelo and picture then they will help us 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.520
 much 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.890
 at the time of attacking so nothing now 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650
 let's see the steps the first step is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 not be predictable now let's see a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.980
 couple of examples look at this move 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.600
 how are we with arda turan playing with 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.430
 toni kroos trying to open gaps in the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 center of the field and here I will operate the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.900
 picture to look at the area marked he 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 he has three midfielders and we 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.800
 only two for what he has 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 superiority in that part of the field by 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.160
 what if we want to go through it is going to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.930
 be very difficult we are going to have a 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.940
 wall of three players plus all the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
 defense that has so we only have left 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.630
 make a horizontal pass if we want 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 move to the center of the field and this is the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.040
 error those horizontal passes where he 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.410
 it has more players it is very difficult to draw 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.820
 a play in attack of that 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.860
 feature not with that pass 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.300
 horizontal now look at this play is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.580
 what you have to do here we are going to 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 stop the play look at the whole area 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.780
 marked that there is no player of his and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 the front of the area and a little more 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.440
 back it 's all free with a player 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 our prepared to stick it or even 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.400
 with benzema that is the one that will receive 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.110
 the ball after the pass of fire can 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.970
 pull or try to haggle but look 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.649
 here the pass was on top that's the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.510
 key to look for in the passes that the rival 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.030
 never never will wait 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.189
 the second step is to open gaps in the field 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.900
 rival more specifically in its frontal 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.819
 of the area that is where we are going to create more 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.769
 danger for example here in this play 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.390
 we see how we touch the ball trying 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.760
 open gaps between the players of the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.799
 rival and we see how his team starts 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.989
 to widen doing that for us 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.000
 it's easier to touch the ball trying 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.349
 make passes that are not predictable as 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.599
 we said in the first step and here 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.640
 we stop the image and see all the 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.190
 gap that has been created between your defense 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.500
 and the center line of the field that 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.940
 right now there is no player and that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.709
 our midfield players 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
 they are going to occupy as we are seeing 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.909
 in this play that look that is with 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 loop of benzema and it ends with a failure of 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.900
 modric but good the play was there 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.819
 created and it was a very clear play here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.409
 we follow the same procedure we follow 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.239
 opening the field and watching as the team 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.190
 of the rival begins to create gaps 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.019
 we keep changing bands now we're going 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.790
 to the next band to the other and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.010
 we keep playing here simply with 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.659
 calm passes not predictable as we have 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.519
 said and here for example look like ya 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.139
 the gap between the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.720
 central and center line 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.849
 field and here the hole is already very big and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 we have two players on top 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.730
 that space that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.470
 take advantage of the gap is created only in 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.819
 As we move forward, look at this pass. 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.620
 made the play you just have to take advantage 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.840
 the gap and give the clear pass and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.970
 definitive now let's see the last 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.770
 example of the second step we are going to 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.990
 to see how that gap is created in the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.489
 front of the area here we open in band 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.290
 to mark it and see that that gap 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.030
 is created but the opponent is going to make a 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.400
 mistake that is to put a midfielder in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.920
 the line of defense what makes that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.840
 hollow almost immense and that we 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.940
 we can use it to fix ourselves 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.190
 with a wall and make a good third goal 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.110
 and last step patience and when I say 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.480
 patience I mean do not rush 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.010
 with the passes in this last step I'm not going 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.900
 to stop the image and I'm going to mark the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.610
 played in red because it is very clear what 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.530
 I want to teach you to look at the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.390
 band down in müller's band the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.769
 hollow that is being created by the passes 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.600
 what are we doing in the center of 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.489
 field the hole has already been created 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.959
 a lot of time but it will not be until 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.030
 now until we're going to put the pass 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.890
 let's wait until the gap is 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.049
 as big as possible because we're going to 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.209
 have more opportunities than the play 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.519
 be more dangerous so even though the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.320
 hollow is believed we have to wait until 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.000
 make it bigger and that's when we give 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.350
 the pass so that the play has 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.210
 more danger and have 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.890
 opportunities to end in a goal for 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.720
 example here we keep changing bands 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.070
 and look again at müller's band 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.960
 what is he going to receive right now 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.700
 here it receives and now the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.440
 hollow but we will not give the pass with the 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.270
 lateral but we're going to play for 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.280
 midfield that the players of the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.920
 center of the field have more vision more 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.510
 pass and that can create the play more 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.910
 dangerous that if we give the pass 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.800
 directly with the side so nothing 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.960
 So far these tips have come 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.970
 these three steps that I think there's 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.680
 continue to play to the touch to me has 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.480
 I hope that you like it and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.850
 meanwhile I leave you with some plays 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.650
 that I have put together the three 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.420
 steps for good you can 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.950
 enjoy and see some good goals 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.690
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.220
 and leave me the comments if it has 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.690
 served if you are going to try it you know 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.790
 that on twitter you can contact me for 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.440
 tell me anything and nothing else for me 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.630
 part I hope you liked it and we 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.630
 we see in the next video see you later 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.379
 and playing well 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.879
 3 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 one
