the hidden armor bonus which makes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
the hidden armor bonus which makes
things<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.559> confusing<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
things a little more confusing so now

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
things a little more confusing so now
that<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> Daedric<00:00:43.079> boots<00:00:43.260> have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that we know that the Daedric boots have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
that we know that the Daedric boots have
a<00:00:43.469> display<00:00:43.860> defense<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> 20<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> an

a display defense of 20 and an

additional hidden armor rating of 25

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.610 
additional hidden armor rating of 25
giving<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> total<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.000> 45<00:00:48.390> defense<00:00:48.809> damage

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
giving it a total of 45 defense damage

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.049 
giving it a total of 45 defense damage
reduction<00:00:49.860> konami<00:00:50.309> calculated<00:00:50.940> by<00:00:51.030> taking

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
reduction konami calculated by taking

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.869 
reduction konami calculated by taking
the<00:00:51.360> total<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.960> multiplying<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> by<00:00:52.590> 0.12<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the total and multiplying it by 0.12 so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
the total and multiplying it by 0.12 so
they<00:00:54.000> reduce<00:00:54.180> 5.4<00:00:55.110> percent<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.530> any<00:00:55.649> damage

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
they reduce 5.4 percent of any damage

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
they reduce 5.4 percent of any damage
but<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> every<00:00:57.239> time<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.539> find<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.780> new

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but to do that every time you find a new

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.150 
but to do that every time you find a new
piece<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> armor<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.980> tedious

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
piece of armor could be a little tedious

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.950 
piece of armor could be a little tedious
so<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> mod<00:01:00.120> installed<00:01:00.300> you'll<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so with the mod installed you'll see the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.330 
so with the mod installed you'll see the
new<00:01:01.109> displayed<00:01:01.500> armor<00:01:01.800> rating<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
new displayed armor rating which is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.680 
new displayed armor rating which is
actually<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> percentage<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> damage

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
actually the percentage of damage

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually the percentage of damage
reduced<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.129> quite<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> same<00:01:05.700> for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
reduced but it's not quite the same for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
reduced but it's not quite the same for
example<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> Daedric<00:01:06.930> boots<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.439> armor

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
example the Daedric boots have an armor

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
example the Daedric boots have an armor
rating<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> 2<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.729> reduced<00:01:09.060> 2<00:01:09.270> percent<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
rating of 2 so they reduced 2 percent of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
rating of 2 so they reduced 2 percent of
any<00:01:09.780> damage<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> mod<00:01:11.159> installed<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
any damage so with the mod installed is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
any damage so with the mod installed is
significantly<00:01:12.299> less<00:01:12.479> damage<00:01:12.869> being<00:01:13.049> reduced

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
significantly less damage being reduced

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.570 
significantly less damage being reduced
and<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> tweak<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and that's because of a tweak the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
and that's because of a tweak the
automate<00:01:14.880> -<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> formula<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.080> mud<00:01:16.229> still

automate - the formula the mud still

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
automate - the formula the mud still
takes<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> old<00:01:17.009> displayed<00:01:17.430> armor<00:01:17.700> rating

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
takes the old displayed armor rating

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
takes the old displayed armor rating
formula<00:01:18.479> gets<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> outcome<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.530> then

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
formula gets the outcome but then

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
formula gets the outcome but then
ignores<00:01:20.009> any<00:01:20.189> hidden<00:01:20.400> armor<00:01:20.729> rating<00:01:20.820> bonuses

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
ignores any hidden armor rating bonuses

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
ignores any hidden armor rating bonuses
and<00:01:21.630> instead<00:01:22.049> multiplies<00:01:22.560> by<00:01:22.740> 0.1<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.460> then

formula isn't really a problem in our
opinion<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:00.960> makes<00:02:01.259> things<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> little

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
opinion it just makes things a little

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
opinion it just makes things a little
more<00:02:01.829> difficult<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.579> it'd<00:02:02.700> still<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.000> nice<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
more difficult but it'd still be nice to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.490 
more difficult but it'd still be nice to
have<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> version<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.930> uses<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> vanilla

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
have a version that uses the vanilla

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
have a version that uses the vanilla
formula<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.189> displays<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> damage

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
formula and just displays the damage

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
formula and just displays the damage
reduction<00:02:06.299> percentage<00:02:06.840> instead<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.439> if

reduction percentage instead and if

reduction percentage instead and if
anything<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.399> nice<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.849> new<00:02:09.030> ideas
