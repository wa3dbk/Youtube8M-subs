00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi there welcome to the drill stuff real

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.300 
hi there welcome to the drill stuff real
easy<00:00:02.280> bubble<00:00:02.820> alphabet<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:04.069> table<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.160> is

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
easy bubble alphabet and table this is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.450 
easy bubble alphabet and table this is
the<00:00:05.460> letter<00:00:05.640> S<00:00:06.230> so<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.740> draw<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
the letter S so I want you to draw a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.330 
the letter S so I want you to draw a
vertical<00:00:08.670> line<00:00:08.880> down<00:00:09.240> there<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.340> vertical

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
vertical line down there and vertical

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.910 
vertical line down there and vertical
line<00:00:11.550> down<00:00:11.900> there<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.500> you're<00:00:13.679> making

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
line down there so that you're making

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.829 
line down there so that you're making
two<00:00:14.070> square<00:00:14.460> boxes<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.299> will<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
two square boxes that that will be the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.670 
two square boxes that that will be the
same<00:00:16.049> width<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> same<00:00:17.250> height

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
same width as that is the same height

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.920 
same width as that is the same height
and<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.500> easy<00:00:23.660> okay

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and this is not so easy okay

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.880 
and this is not so easy okay
so<00:00:25.289> draw<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:27.140> curve<00:00:28.140> around<00:00:28.349> there

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
so draw a kind of a curve around there

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
so draw a kind of a curve around there
this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> probably<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> hardest<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this is probably the hardest one and a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.200 
this is probably the hardest one and a
lot<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.230> yes<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.730> want<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> draw<00:00:33.059> these

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
lot I think yes so we want to draw these

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.490 
lot I think yes so we want to draw these
two<00:00:33.480> curves<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.989> they're<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> meet

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
two curves so they're going to meet

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
two curves so they're going to meet
roughly<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> middle<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:37.050> then

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
roughly in the middle like that and then

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.190 
roughly in the middle like that and then
bring<00:00:39.350> bring<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.489> again<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.750> fact<00:00:42.989> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
bring bring it down and again in fact we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
bring bring it down and again in fact we
want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> make<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.010> slightly<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
want to make this just slightly over the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
want to make this just slightly over the
top<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.010> line<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.309> over<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> top<00:00:48.090> bottom

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
top of that line and over the top bottom

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
top of that line and over the top bottom
of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> book<00:00:49.170> below<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> baseline<00:00:50.420> okay<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of the book below the baseline okay and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.369 
of the book below the baseline okay and
then<00:00:52.640> draw<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.690> around<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:57.379> like

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
then draw all the way around it like

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.310 
then draw all the way around it like
that

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.410 

and<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.190> will<00:01:04.340> give<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.550> your<00:01:04.580> s<00:01:04.940> no<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
and that will give you your s no the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.870 
and that will give you your s no the
lowercase<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.280> going<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.550> be<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> bit

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
lowercase this is going to be a bit

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.170 
lowercase this is going to be a bit
harder<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.210> fit<00:01:08.510> in<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.140> let's<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:10.060> square<00:01:11.060> to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
harder to fit in so let's do a square to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.170 
harder to fit in so let's do a square to
see<00:01:11.360> how<00:01:11.600> we<00:01:12.050> all<00:01:12.200> fit<00:01:12.440> this<00:01:12.650> in<00:01:12.860> again<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.820> this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
see how we all fit this in again so this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.610 
see how we all fit this in again so this
again<00:01:14.450> wants<00:01:14.690> me<00:01:14.780> just<00:01:14.990> slightly<00:01:15.170> above<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
again wants me just slightly above and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.960 
again wants me just slightly above and
below<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.890> line<00:01:17.080> home<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.520> I'm<00:01:19.520> going<00:01:19.940> to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
below the line home and I'm going to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.080 
below the line home and I'm going to
work<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.270> this<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.750> corner<00:01:21.320> here<00:01:21.910> it's<00:01:22.910> not

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
work to this this corner here it's not

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.070 
work to this this corner here it's not
will<00:01:23.240> go<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.390> about<00:01:23.600> there<00:01:24.050> go<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.100> edge

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
will go to about there go to this edge

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.990 
will go to about there go to this edge
and<00:01:27.080> then<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:27.770> want<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.010> do<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.190> similar<00:01:28.670> kind<00:01:28.850> of

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
and then we want to do a similar kind of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.160 
and then we want to do a similar kind of
thing<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.479> fact<00:01:32.930> we're

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
thing like that so in fact we're

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.680 
thing like that so in fact we're
probably<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:34.400> probably<00:01:34.729> about<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.910> third<00:01:35.330> of

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
probably it's probably about a third of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.620 
probably it's probably about a third of
of<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:37.040> square<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.729> what<00:01:37.910> you're<00:01:38.060> aiming<00:01:38.240> for

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
of that square is what you're aiming for

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.300 
of that square is what you're aiming for
and<00:01:39.110> again<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.460> want<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.759> go<00:01:42.100> all<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.160> way

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
and again you want to go all the way

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.760 
and again you want to go all the way
around<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.790> outside<00:01:46.300> like<00:01:47.300> that<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.930> then<00:01:48.590> we

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
around the outside like that and then we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.140 
around the outside like that and then we
well<00:01:50.590> draw<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:54.530> pink<00:01:54.950> all<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.340> way<00:01:55.550> around<00:01:55.880> or

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
well draw in pink all the way around or

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.640 
well draw in pink all the way around or
you<00:01:56.270> can<00:01:56.420> just<00:01:56.570> paint<00:01:56.750> over<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> top<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.560> can

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
you can just paint over the top you can

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.200 
you can just paint over the top you can
do<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.979> have<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.190> don't<00:01:58.400> mean<00:01:58.640> even<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.030> is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
do and have you don't mean even this is

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.370 
do and have you don't mean even this is
this<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.690> just<00:01:59.869> showing<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.440> outline<00:02:00.940> and
