have earthquake then again he could have
switched<00:01:43.799> out<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> guess<00:01:44.549> skull<00:01:44.850> wasn't<00:01:45.659> too

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
up a free substitute because if I do so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810 
up a free substitute because if I do so
then<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.900> could<00:02:19.140> turn<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.710> be<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.130> really

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
big problem but he's playing this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
big problem but he's playing this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
obvious but as I said I did not want to

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.700

mess around with that sceptile so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.200 
mess around with that sceptile so
unfortunately<00:02:59.250> because<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> intimidate

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
unfortunately because of the intimidate

unfortunately because of the intimidate
drop<00:03:00.420> I'm<00:03:00.630> gonna<00:03:00.900> be<00:03:01.020> forced<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> switch<00:03:01.770> out

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010

combine dark pole spiritomb which I knew

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.980 
combine dark pole spiritomb which I knew
could<00:03:16.770> possibly<00:03:17.430> sweep<00:03:18.390> through<00:03:18.600> his<00:03:18.720> team

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
could possibly sweep through his team

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.050 
could possibly sweep through his team
after<00:03:19.230> maybe<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.920> call<00:03:20.220> mine<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.820> thought

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
after maybe to call mine so I thought

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.550 
after maybe to call mine so I thought
this<00:03:21.240> would<00:03:21.300> be<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> good<00:03:21.750> chance<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.170> me<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
this would be a good chance for me to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.650 
this would be a good chance for me to
start<00:03:22.890> setting<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.520> predicting<00:03:24.000> him<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
start setting up so predicting him to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.420 
start setting up so predicting him to
want<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.959> go<00:03:25.080> for<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.350> waterfall<00:03:25.980> I'm

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
want to go for the waterfall I'm

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.010 
want to go for the waterfall I'm
actually<00:03:26.640> gonna<00:03:26.910> go<00:03:27.000> for<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.420> rest<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.750> i<00:03:27.870> can

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
actually gonna go for the rest so i can

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900 
actually gonna go for the rest so i can
start<00:03:28.140> sleep<00:03:28.500> talking<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.130> been<00:03:29.459> pulling

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
start sleep talking and been pulling

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.150 
start sleep talking and been pulling
some<00:03:29.940> call<00:03:30.390> mines<00:03:30.720> unfortunately<00:03:31.680> he

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
some call mines unfortunately he

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.800 
some call mines unfortunately he
switches<00:03:32.430> directly<00:03:32.970> into<00:03:33.150> Sceptile<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.780> I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
switches directly into Sceptile and I

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.660 
switches directly into Sceptile and I
guess<00:03:33.990> looking<00:03:34.110> back<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.860> could<00:03:35.550> have

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
guess looking back at it I could have

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.980 
guess looking back at it I could have
gone<00:03:35.820> straight<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.390> dark<00:03:36.630> pools<00:03:36.810> I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
gone straight for the dark pools I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.360 
gone straight for the dark pools I
actually<00:03:37.110> thought<00:03:37.560> about<00:03:37.620> going<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.310> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
actually thought about going for the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.980 
actually thought about going for the
dark<00:03:38.580> pools<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.970> was<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.209> well<00:03:39.420> if<00:03:39.600> he

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
dark pools but I was like well if he

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.390 
dark pools but I was like well if he
flinches<00:03:40.410> me<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.709> stuff<00:03:40.920> then<00:03:41.130> I'd<00:03:41.220> rather

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
flinches me and stuff then I'd rather

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.380 
flinches me and stuff then I'd rather
just<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:42.300> able<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.140> rest<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.970> don't

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
just be able to rest and just I don't

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.180 
just be able to rest and just I don't
know<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.630> guess<00:03:46.020> rest<00:03:46.440> really<00:03:46.740> wasn't<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.040> bad

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
know I guess rest really wasn't a bad

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.860 
know I guess rest really wasn't a bad
player<00:03:47.490> but<00:03:47.700> at<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.880> same<00:03:48.060> time<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.480> wasn't<00:03:48.630> my

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
player but at the same time it wasn't my

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.080 
player but at the same time it wasn't my
best<00:03:49.110> play<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> switch<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.880> my

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
best play to do so I switch it to my

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.910 
best play to do so I switch it to my
hairy<00:03:51.330> Yama<00:03:51.600> unfortunately<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
hairy Yama unfortunately this is the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.470 
hairy Yama unfortunately this is the
only<00:03:53.040> pokemon<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> switch<00:03:54.209> in

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
only pokemon that I have the switch in

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.690 
only pokemon that I have the switch in
that<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.230> take<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.530> hit<00:03:55.830> from<00:03:55.950> sceptile<00:03:56.459> and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
that can take a hit from sceptile and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.750 
that can take a hit from sceptile and
it's<00:03:57.420> severely<00:03:57.990> weakened<00:03:58.590> also<00:03:59.100> meaning<00:03:59.550> that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
it's severely weakened also meaning that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.480 
it's severely weakened also meaning that
that<00:04:00.090> mad<00:04:00.420> border<00:04:00.810> has<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.620> become<00:04:01.770> an<00:04:02.220> even

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
that mad border has just become an even

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.720 
that mad border has just become an even
bigger<00:04:03.209> threat<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.990> my<00:04:04.170> team<00:04:04.500> as<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:05.280> get<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.490> crib

bigger threat to my team as I get a crib

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.160 
bigger threat to my team as I get a crib
with<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:05.880> knockoff<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.720> bullet<00:04:06.990> punch

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170

with a knockoff I have the bullet punch
so<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> doubt<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.010> knockoff<00:04:08.430> crit<00:04:08.760> really

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.360 
so I doubt the knockoff crit really
matters<00:04:09.600> cuz<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:10.080> very<00:04:10.530> positive<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.160> would

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
mess around with that thing so I'm gonna

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.670

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
so he's gonna make the save switch back

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.850 
so he's gonna make the save switch back
into<00:04:39.719> the<00:04:39.840> coefficient<00:04:40.259> which<00:04:40.349> honestly<00:04:40.560> the

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
punched the incoming craigy lee but in

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.050 
punched the incoming craigy lee but in
the<00:05:55.259> long<00:05:55.469> run<00:05:55.500> i<00:05:55.710> knew<00:05:55.979> that<00:05:56.009> even<00:05:56.399> if<00:05:56.879> i<00:05:57.000> did

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
the long run i knew that even if i did

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.450 
the long run i knew that even if i did
fake<00:05:57.479> out<00:05:57.659> Dre<00:05:57.930> point<00:05:58.169> she<00:05:58.469> should<00:05:58.979> still<00:05:59.250> do

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
fake out Dre point she should still do

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.309 
fake out Dre point she should still do
enough<00:05:59.759> to<00:05:59.879> the<00:06:00.000> point<00:06:00.029> where<00:06:00.419> even<00:06:00.599> after

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
enough to the point where even after

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.439 
enough to the point where even after
recover<00:06:01.680> i<00:06:01.919> can<00:06:02.430> still<00:06:02.699> kind<00:06:03.120> of<00:06:03.300> be

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
recover i can still kind of be

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.480 
recover i can still kind of be
creatively<00:06:03.870> one<00:06:04.139> on<00:06:04.259> one<00:06:04.439> but<00:06:04.620> he<00:06:04.680> makes<00:06:05.339> a

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
creatively one on one but he makes a

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.550 
creatively one on one but he makes a
very<00:06:05.729> questionable<00:06:06.569> play<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.199> instead<00:06:07.469> of

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
very questionable play and instead of

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.499 
very questionable play and instead of
going<00:06:07.740> for<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.889> recover<00:06:08.250> he<00:06:08.819> goes<00:06:09.060> stripped

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
going for the recover he goes stripped

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.909 
going for the recover he goes stripped
for<00:06:09.629> the<00:06:09.719> energy<00:06:10.080> ball<00:06:10.229> so<00:06:10.439> i'm<00:06:10.500> guessing<00:06:10.680> he

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
for the energy ball so i'm guessing he

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.010 
for the energy ball so i'm guessing he
doesn't<00:06:11.069> have<00:06:11.310> toxic<00:06:11.789> because<00:06:11.969> with<00:06:12.810> drain

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
doesn't have toxic because with drain

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.420 
doesn't have toxic because with drain
punch<00:06:13.199> and<00:06:13.349> toxic<00:06:13.770> he<00:06:13.860> might<00:06:14.099> have<00:06:14.219> been<00:06:14.310> able

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
punch and toxic he might have been able

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.610 
punch and toxic he might have been able
