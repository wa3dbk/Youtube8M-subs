00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
like set to eight to ten reps and work

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
like set to eight to ten reps and work
you<00:02:27.959> know<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.590> you're<00:02:28.920> working<00:02:29.100> on

you know if you if you're working on

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
you know if you if you're working on
some<00:02:29.520> repetitions<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.480> learn<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.780> form

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
some repetitions going to learn the form

some repetitions going to learn the form
a<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.320> bit<00:02:31.530> better<00:02:32.120> try<00:02:33.120> two<00:02:33.180> things<00:02:33.690> when

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
a little bit better try two things when

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
a little bit better try two things when
you<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.080> your<00:02:34.230> box<00:02:34.470> squat<00:02:34.800> if<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.430> can't

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you do your box squat if you can't

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.310 
you do your box squat if you can't
remember<00:02:35.850> anything<00:02:36.240> else<00:02:36.450> driving<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.110> two

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
remember anything else driving these two

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.100 
remember anything else driving these two
things<00:02:38.000> don't<00:02:39.000> allow<00:02:39.209> your<00:02:39.330> knees<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.570> travel

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
things don't allow your knees to travel

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.990 
things don't allow your knees to travel
forward<00:02:40.350> too<00:02:40.650> much<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.670> shouldn't<00:02:41.970> really

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
forward too much it shouldn't really

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.590 
forward too much it shouldn't really
travel<00:02:42.540> forward<00:02:42.780> much<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:44.360> keep<00:02:45.360> your

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
travel forward much at all and keep your

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.530 
travel forward much at all and keep your
spine<00:02:45.810> neutral<00:02:46.080> keep<00:02:46.830> your<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.130> straight

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
spine neutral keep your back straight

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.790 
spine neutral keep your back straight
you<00:02:48.540> remember<00:02:48.840> those<00:02:48.959> two<00:02:49.170> things<00:02:49.380> I'd<00:02:49.680> be

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
you remember those two things I'd be

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.090 
you remember those two things I'd be
great<00:02:50.570> also<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.600> guess<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.019> third<00:02:52.200> thing<00:02:52.470> would

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
great also I guess the third thing would

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.860 
great also I guess the third thing would
be<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> slightly<00:02:54.150> wider<00:02:54.480> stance

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
be to go with a slightly wider stance

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.570 
be to go with a slightly wider stance
and<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> normally<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:57.260> as<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.920> go<00:02:59.070> down<00:02:59.280> in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and you normally would as you go down in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.340 
and you normally would as you go down in
depth<00:02:59.820> as<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.420> lower<00:03:00.690> box<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.230> may

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
depth as you go to a lower box you may

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.750 
depth as you go to a lower box you may
have<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.590> bring<00:03:01.769> your<00:03:01.860> stance<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> little

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
have to bring your stance in a little

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.420 
have to bring your stance in a little
bit<00:03:03.230> because<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.500> may<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.830> some<00:03:05.070> mobility

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
bit because you may have some mobility

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.370 
bit because you may have some mobility
and<00:03:05.850> some<00:03:07.340> limitations<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.519> your<00:03:08.640> hip<00:03:08.910> so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
and some limitations in your hip so

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.750 
and some limitations in your hip so
hopefully<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.530> answers<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:10.950> question<00:03:11.070> I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
hopefully that answers your question I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.650 
hopefully that answers your question I

good<00:03:18.239> mornings<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:19.110> those<00:03:19.350> exercises<00:03:19.890> are

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
good mornings of those exercises are

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.660 
good mornings of those exercises are
going<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.730> lunges<00:03:21.590> step<00:03:22.590> ups<00:03:22.860> or

with light weights and really try to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.240 
with light weights and really try to
work<00:03:34.230> them<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:34.620> try<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.100> those

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.300 
build the strength of those hamstrings
as<00:03:39.329> well<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:40.230> not<00:03:40.410> always<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.980> mobility

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
as well it's not always just a mobility

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.370 
as well it's not always just a mobility
issue<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.880> lot<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.180> times<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.600> strength<00:03:42.930> hu<00:03:43.260> as

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
issue a lot of times to strength hu as

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.530 
issue a lot of times to strength hu as
well<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.340> why<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.549> recommended<00:03:45.269> some<00:03:45.450> of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
well so that's why I recommended some of

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.170 
well so that's why I recommended some of
those<00:03:45.630> exercises<00:03:46.610> go<00:03:47.610> on<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.970> next

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
those exercises go on to the next

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.539 
those exercises go on to the next
question<00:03:48.269> here<00:03:48.840> got<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> question<00:03:49.709> about<00:03:49.950> sumo

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
question here got a question about sumo
