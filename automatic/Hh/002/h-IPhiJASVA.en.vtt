00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 It's kind of weird, let's analyze and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.170
 write but I need what it is more 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.380
 strange a little people stay 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.650
 crazy does not have in this classify what 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.139
 happened was that if at first I suffered 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.690
 a little this will make a book that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.590
 hide the designer doing separate 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.650
 comes a point worth the putin 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.650
 dane 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.860
 the idea of ​​the blue seal 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.640
 once i was on the internet i was 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.880
 reading a passage from last year I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.380
 I was reading a story that I did not enter 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.480
 on the news portal 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.420
 I think that 's how you know five 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.230
 Batman features can help you 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.230
 evolve at work 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 button is batman 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 there is an outside that point things 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.509
 arrive 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.560
 I did not go in to see what it is like with 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 characteristics of the neighborhood so I stayed 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 a month and tango entered the portals 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 collecting their headlines and not reading 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 headlines photographs the headlines from 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.090
 that they did not have bizarre sessions at 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.320
 shantala a serious selection and thought that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.600
 Someone could discuss this series and I 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 I thought the carnival intention is always 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 subject is a preferred therapy 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.790
 only the conversations in the end begin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.010
 discussing these things and ending 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.799
 they were registered to sing with them 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.490
 trying to discuss a theme of death 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.590
 money friends and he can not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 resist powerful seat on the table 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 dinner, then your two were already 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 leaving a child is there with the character 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.890
 that reminds you to remind the reader of the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.570
 malaise of what I find interesting 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.370
 to draw a child and then I 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.330
 I'm with a 7 year old child . 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.299
 drawing 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.310
 I found a lot I think it would be 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.810
 interesting to make one of your 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 a 7-year-old child who is not a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.720
 artistic talent 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 then every discussion of parents is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.280
 illustrated other alison 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.519
 this book has one I tried to take 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.709
 careful I just did not know but he has 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.180
 elements that can lead to readings 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.459
 very beasts 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.989
 first that the guilt is 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.569
 all of the media 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.299
 this is a risk 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.579
 I think the biggest risk of the book then I 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:51.409
 I try not to do this and others and are 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:56.450
 drawings because the drawings are not there 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:58.639
 very difficult before then you have the risk 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.139
 to say whether the eighth sale of this 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.269
 child spoiled by the world by parents 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:12.109
 in the media for everything this kid is 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:15.169
 one is in fact the sky. 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.599
 blue is nothing more than a look at the 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.680
 world today with the diagnosis of 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.209
 multiple organ failure 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.299
 I said it was cool. 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.849
 within this idea is to put 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.250
 openings as if the publisher had 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.909
 selling ads within the book is 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.919
 Of course there will be people who first go 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.079
 to think that it is serious will think that 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.269
 Our editor, how absurd that is in this. 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.000
 that I'm independent are 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.989
 selling but I think a little grace is 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Is not it? 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.819
 I used typographic resources to give 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.840
 tone tones of 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:00.939
 talking then for example has a 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.430
 chapter that the guy husband get drunk 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.519
 And then everything he says is between the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.439
 squeezed letter and learn nothing 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.400
 or they begin to discuss then already 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:15.500
 are on top of the other blue sky what 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.389
 that I thought for example is a little 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.639
 discomfort thing will do with 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.380
 their experience is a delight but 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.229
 have a bit of dirt and coimbra 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.210
 and then he tried several things here and the 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.370
 that he got the best result was 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.960
 the sand 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.960
 so we put sand manually 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.930
 with real sand, sand you go 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.509
 read the bible fall on you but not much 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.900
 sand is a metaphor of the book you take 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:50.289
 What is going on here, same thing? 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.760
 That's cool, is not it? 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.169
 world that wants to do something. 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.509
 that the people are all super 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.509
 accustomed and find it cool and fun
