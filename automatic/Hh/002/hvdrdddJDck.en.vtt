I<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> us<00:00:35.899> are<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> pretty

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I think a lot of us are a pretty

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.250 
I think a lot of us are a pretty
judgmental<00:00:38.010> especially<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.989> lack

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
judgmental especially when we lack

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.220 
judgmental especially when we lack
experience<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:44.309> myself<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.780> few

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
experience because if I was myself a few

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900 
experience because if I was myself a few
years<00:00:46.289> ago<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> first<00:00:47.190> started<00:00:47.730> lifting

they're in their peak conditioning

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.680 
they're in their peak conditioning
meaning<00:03:41.549> they<00:03:41.819> are<00:03:41.970> lean<00:03:42.239> lighting<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:44.690> angle
