come<00:01:52.909> back<00:01:53.150> into<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.640> Avengers<00:01:56.030> 2<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.540> and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
come back into the Avengers 2 and and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.749 
come back into the Avengers 2 and and
three<00:01:57.079> now<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.290> have<00:01:57.500> no<00:01:57.710> confirmation<00:01:58.100> they

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
three now we have no confirmation they

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.940 
three now we have no confirmation they
didn't<00:01:58.909> say<00:01:59.090> anything<00:01:59.119> about<00:01:59.360> an<00:01:59.780> Iron<00:02:00.409> Man<00:02:00.590> 4

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.490 
didn't say anything about an Iron Man 4
so<00:02:01.640> maybe<00:02:02.000> they're<00:02:02.869> not<00:02:02.900> going<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.380> an

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.380 
so maybe they're not going to do an
Ironman<00:02:03.860> for<00:02:04.100> these<00:02:04.340> not<00:02:04.610> for<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.880> little<00:02:05.090> while

Incredible Hulk which was a little bit
of<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.650> weird<00:04:18.890> change<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.400> thought<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.720> they

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
of a weird change I thought I think they

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.570 
of a weird change I thought I think they
probably<00:04:21.070> should<00:04:22.070> have<00:04:22.160> just<00:04:22.250> gone<00:04:22.520> with

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
probably should have just gone with

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.340 
probably should have just gone with
Edward<00:04:23.000> Norton<00:04:23.450> just<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.780> keep<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.230> like

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
Edward Norton just to keep it just like

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.950 
Edward Norton just to keep it just like
this<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:25.100> keep<00:04:25.250> going<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.760> way<00:04:26.030> but<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.660> don't

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
this to keep going that way but I don't

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.390 
this to keep going that way but I don't
think<00:04:27.140> that's<00:04:27.380> as<00:04:27.650> important<00:04:28.280> because

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
think that's as important because

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.520 
think that's as important because
obviously<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:29.480> know<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.870> Hulk<00:04:30.290> and

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
obviously you know you have a Hulk and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.220 
obviously you know you have a Hulk and
Bruce<00:04:30.980> Banner<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.850> part<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.630> but

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
Bruce Banner is just part of that but

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.840 
Bruce Banner is just part of that but
it's<00:04:33.440> kind<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.710> like<00:04:33.830> two<00:04:34.100> different<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.700> know

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
it's kind of like two different you know

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.420

it worked out well anyway with Mark

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
it i like i'm personally like to see the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.870 
it i like i'm personally like to see the
same<00:04:42.350> act<00:04:42.590> do<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.010> all<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.280> way<00:04:43.400> through<00:04:43.669> and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
same act do it all the way through and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.120 
same act do it all the way through and
definitely<00:04:44.600> with<00:04:44.930> what<00:04:45.380> down<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.770> doing<00:04:45.919> it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
definitely with what down and doing it

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.730 
definitely with what down and doing it
it<00:04:46.550> would<00:04:46.760> be<00:04:46.880> really<00:04:47.180> hard<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.660> see<00:04:47.990> anyone

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
it would be really hard to see anyone

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.110 
it would be really hard to see anyone

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
else step in and try to

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.700 
else step in and try to
do<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.389> i<00:04:50.419> mean<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.810> imagine<00:04:51.320> how<00:04:51.440> hard<00:04:51.680> that

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
do that i mean you imagine how hard that

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.890 
do that i mean you imagine how hard that
would<00:04:51.919> be<00:04:51.979> after<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.030> first<00:04:53.210> three<00:04:53.479> IMF

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
would be after the first three IMF

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.780 
would be after the first three IMF
movies<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.620> avengers<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.130> how<00:04:55.370> successful

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
movies the avengers and how successful

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.719 
movies the avengers and how successful
it<00:04:56.030> was<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.990> know<00:04:57.020> I'm<00:04:57.770> glad<00:04:58.040> marble<00:04:58.460> decide

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
it was you know I'm glad marble decide

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.219 
it was you know I'm glad marble decide
to<00:04:58.850> pay<00:04:59.030> whatever<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.540> heck<00:04:59.690> they<00:04:59.720> paid<00:05:00.080> them

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
to pay whatever the heck they paid them

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.890 
to pay whatever the heck they paid them
I<00:05:00.350> think<00:05:00.680> it's<00:05:00.770> worth<00:05:00.949> it<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.510> for<00:05:02.510> me<00:05:02.630> it

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
I think it's worth it and for me it

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.629 
I think it's worth it and for me it
makes<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.199> even<00:05:03.320> more<00:05:03.470> exciting<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.430> see

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
makes it even more exciting to see

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.310 
makes it even more exciting to see
Avengers<00:05:05.060> 2<00:05:05.240> because<00:05:05.720> by<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:05.930> time<00:05:06.050> they

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
Avengers 2 because by the time they

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.020

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
they're going to make another one after

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.840 
they're going to make another one after
that<00:05:09.470> they<00:05:09.680> may<00:05:09.860> take<00:05:10.070> iron<00:05:10.280> man<00:05:10.490> out<00:05:10.669> of<00:05:10.699> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
that they may take iron man out of the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.740 
that they may take iron man out of the
roster<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.479> events<00:05:12.020> at<00:05:12.139> that<00:05:12.290> point<00:05:13.750> yeah

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
roster of the events at that point yeah

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
roster of the events at that point yeah
I<00:05:14.780> mean<00:05:15.020> because<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:16.010> would<00:05:16.160> have

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
I mean because you you would have

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.730 
I mean because you you would have
already<00:05:16.430> seen<00:05:16.820> three<00:05:17.540> iron<00:05:17.870> man<00:05:18.110> movies<00:05:18.500> and

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
already seen three iron man movies and

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.439 
already seen three iron man movies and
three<00:05:19.100> Avengers<00:05:19.520> movies<00:05:19.820> with<00:05:20.030> him<00:05:20.180> playing

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
three Avengers movies with him playing

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.080 
three Avengers movies with him playing
then<00:05:21.229> they<00:05:21.500> might<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:21.919> put<00:05:22.310> another<00:05:22.520> Avenger

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
then they might just put another Avenger

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.969 
then they might just put another Avenger
in<00:05:23.270> in<00:05:23.449> place<00:05:23.479> of<00:05:23.690> iron<00:05:23.960> man<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.410> say<00:05:24.590> as<00:05:24.800> mine

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
in in place of iron man and say as mine

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.500 
in in place of iron man and say as mine
do<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:25.190> anymore<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:26.000> don't<00:05:26.030> think<00:05:26.300> people

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
do it anymore and I don't think people

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.719 
do it anymore and I don't think people
would<00:05:26.690> be<00:05:26.870> upset<00:05:26.960> at<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:27.650> point<00:05:27.949> if<00:05:28.400> they<00:05:28.580> did

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
would be upset at that point if they did

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.340 
would be upset at that point if they did
now<00:05:29.000> people<00:05:29.479> might<00:05:29.510> be<00:05:29.720> like<00:05:29.840> all<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.169> gotta

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
now people might be like all you gotta

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.860 
now people might be like all you gotta
have<00:05:30.470> iron<00:05:30.650> man<00:05:30.830> it's<00:05:30.979> not<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:31.280> Avengers<00:05:31.870> but

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
have iron man it's not the Avengers but

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.960 
have iron man it's not the Avengers but
