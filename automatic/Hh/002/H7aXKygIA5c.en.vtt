00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.800
 hello everyone today let's make a video 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:08.469
 in which we will explain how how 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.470
 increase the memory of our nexus 10 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.030
 or of its 7 with a pendrive is valid for 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.209
 so good first thing we have 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.249
 what to do is the first one is very 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.279
 important not to have the pattern of 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.890
 unlocking for our tablet the pattern 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.450
 what gives you android is worth you can put 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.310
 because the statisticians draw and other 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.520
 not having that I will not have any 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.900
 problem ensured for it good what 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 first we need to download 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.850
 this application that we see here is worth this 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.960
 from here it is nexus media vale we give it and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.150
 this application is not that it's 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.450
 downloaded what you are going to do is that 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.989
 when we connect the cable we detect 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.980
 the pendrive is worth this application, not the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.390
 you can download through playstation 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.550
 3 others 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.510
 from other servers that are good 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.090
 are from another source and well I have 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.610
 opted to do it from play store that 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.050
 Even if you have to pay, well, it's a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.020
 little bit more gives me a little more 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.970
 guarantees and trustworthy well for 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.229
 we need this as you know this cable 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.770
 this cable is a male of mini hd sorry 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.360
 mini usb that takes you to a female 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.090
 of usb vale is a cable tg that as 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.630
 you have to ask, indicating that it is usb 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.460
 for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.470
 to see where mini-USB to USB worth it 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.790
 we connect and once we have connected 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.630
 the cable is worth what we do is connect 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.810
 already directly on our pendrive it is worth 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.370
 connect the pendrive and you will leave a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.000
 annotation that is this that we see here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.130
 We connect for a little while and this will come out 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.630
 adaptation you want to open a medium 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.720
 amount when connecting that USB device 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.930
 we give you to accept 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.580
 and load the device once we have 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.869
 loaded the device because here we already 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.390
 comes out in this case, what do I have 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.810
 downloaded from the pendrive as you see here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.990

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.990

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.740

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.740
 to reproduce it with this same 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.770

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.720
