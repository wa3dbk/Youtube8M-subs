00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.810
 let's talk about the pigeon boat 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.280
 not the pot for hands 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.670
 hitting him 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.670
 we have two types of vertical boats 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:39.120
 in static and the public we can not 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.490
 back 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.310
 we can continue 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.610
 We have three different ways to vote 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
 the value 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.990
 first would be to vote at the height of 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.840
 knee 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.870
 according to the form would vote to match 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 of the hip 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.360
 and third way would be to vote at height 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.360
 of man 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 now let's explain the mistakes more 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.320
 of the handball pot one of the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 mistakes is to make doubles that can be of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.800
 two types one bounce the ball and catch it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800
 with your hand 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.789
 henry gives the double second 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.490
 example of doubles can be bouncing the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.250
 and accompanying him this would be like 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.710
 in typical basketball error of those who 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.110
 they have played basketball and the third 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.939
 error may be that you are voting and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.159
 the ball without wanting to have a zone not 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.200
 Regulated how to feel 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.969
 we are going to represent a situation of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.969
 game in which the player makes doubles 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.230
 and the referee's symbolism would be 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 Y 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.200
 to be a surprise to the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.200
 companions 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.180
 now let's see an exercise on a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.180
 boat circuit 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 all right 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.430
 now we will start with the exercise 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.670
 number 3 that will consist of one going 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.870
 to catch the other three while voting 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.870
 with the ball each
