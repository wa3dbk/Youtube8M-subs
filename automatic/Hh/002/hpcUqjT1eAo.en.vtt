the kind of metallic this one as you can
see<00:02:21.070> I've<00:02:21.430> used<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.550> good<00:02:24.850> if

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
see I've used it and it's really good if

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.300 
see I've used it and it's really good if
good<00:02:25.570> material<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.770> look<00:02:27.040> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
good material because if you can look I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.770 
good material because if you can look I
don't<00:02:27.430> know<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.790> you'll<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.120> able<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.570> it's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
don't know if you'll be able to see it's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.240 
don't know if you'll be able to see it's
really<00:02:28.930> smooth<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.530> all<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> do<00:02:30.160> it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
really smooth with all I have to do it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.510 
really smooth with all I have to do it
like<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.970> i<00:02:31.720> have<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.110> my<00:02:32.170> finger

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
like this and i have it on my finger

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.070 
like this and i have it on my finger
automatically<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.690> smooth<00:02:34.960> you

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
automatically so it's really smooth you

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.960 
automatically so it's really smooth you
don't<00:02:35.320> need<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.590> use<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> lot<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.760> really

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
don't need to use a lot so it's really

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.640 
don't need to use a lot so it's really
long-lasting<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.840> i'm<00:02:37.960> pretty<00:02:38.170> sure<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.590> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
long-lasting and i'm pretty sure this is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.530 
long-lasting and i'm pretty sure this is
getting<00:02:39.580> price<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:40.000> other<00:02:40.150> rest<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.480> the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
haven't used this one yet but when I do

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.550 
haven't used this one yet but when I do
I'll<00:03:06.550> let<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.910> know<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.690> judging<00:03:08.410> by

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
I'll let you know but just judging by

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.910 
I'll let you know but just judging by
how<00:03:09.430> they<00:03:10.080> see<00:03:11.080> I'm<00:03:11.170> doing<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.530> same<00:03:11.710> thing

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
how they see I'm doing the same thing

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.150 
how they see I'm doing the same thing
that<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.100> did<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.610> if<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.750> see

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that I did that one if you can see

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.590 
that I did that one if you can see
commonwealth<00:03:15.160> autumn<00:03:15.550> athletes<00:03:15.970> don't<00:03:16.420> need

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
commonwealth autumn athletes don't need

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.690 
commonwealth autumn athletes don't need
a<00:03:16.690> lot<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:20.260> one<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.709> definitely<00:03:20.950> much<00:03:21.340> Annie

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
a lot this one is definitely much Annie

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.720 
a lot this one is definitely much Annie
I<00:03:22.000> guess<00:03:22.690> some<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.860> part<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.610> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
I guess some this is a part of the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.580 
I guess some this is a part of the
rainbow<00:03:24.970> collection<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.400> then<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.959> case<00:03:29.320> is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
rainbow collection and then this case is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.220 
rainbow collection and then this case is
really<00:03:29.890> really<00:03:30.040> nice<00:03:30.510> I'm<00:03:31.510> pretty<00:03:31.810> sure<00:03:31.990> if<00:03:32.110> I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
really really nice I'm pretty sure if I

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.900 
really really nice I'm pretty sure if I
dropped<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.740> nothing<00:03:33.160> would<00:03:33.340> happen<00:03:33.490> because

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
dropped it nothing would happen because

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.090 
dropped it nothing would happen because
the<00:03:34.180> case<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.810> really<00:03:35.170> really<00:03:35.410> protected

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the case is like really really protected

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.730 
the case is like really really protected
and<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.990> what<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.230> looks<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.500> inside

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.730 

you<00:03:41.740> see<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.070> has<00:03:42.190> all<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.430> blushes<00:03:43.000> different

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
you see it has all the blushes different

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.170 
you see it has all the blushes different
tones<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.920> blushes<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.700> has<00:03:45.880> all<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
tones of blushes and it has all the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.110 
tones of blushes and it has all the
eyeshadows<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:46.870> things<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
eyeshadows and things like that and I

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.970 
eyeshadows and things like that and I
haven't<00:03:49.480> use<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.750> one<00:03:49.959> either<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:50.890> I'm

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
haven't use this one either but I'm

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.400 
haven't use this one either but I'm
assuming<00:03:51.550> since<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.180> use<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.810> other<00:03:52.990> shiny

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
assuming since I use the other shiny

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.960 
assuming since I use the other shiny
palette<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:53.950> I'm<00:03:54.100> about<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.520> show<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.700> guys

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
palette that I'm about to show you guys

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.730 
palette that I'm about to show you guys
that<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:55.990> good<00:03:56.170> quality<00:03:56.590> also

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
that this is really good quality also

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.540 
that this is really good quality also
because<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.270> was<00:03:58.510> really<00:03:58.990> really<00:03:59.380> good

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
because that one was really really good

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.090 
because that one was really really good
really<00:04:00.550> good<00:04:00.700> quality<00:04:01.270> 5<00:04:01.480> stars<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.980> is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
really good quality 5 stars so this is

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.690 
really good quality 5 stars so this is
the<00:04:03.190> one<00:04:03.340> I'm<00:04:03.459> speaking<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:05.040> all<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.430> far<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
the one I'm speaking of all so far the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.010 
the one I'm speaking of all so far the
rainbow<00:04:07.180> collection<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.989> first

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
rainbow collection and this is the first

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.920 
rainbow collection and this is the first
layer<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.830> all<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.000> colors

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
layer of it all the colors

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.779 
layer of it all the colors

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
and then lift it up and this is the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:26.409 
and then lift it up and this is the
second<00:04:20.180> part<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:22.539> I've<00:04:23.539> used<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:25.419> screen
