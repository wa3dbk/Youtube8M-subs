00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
look at that beam I mean that's a lot of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.430 
look at that beam I mean that's a lot of
that's<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.890> lot<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.220> range<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.930> means<00:03:44.080> from

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
can see that that beam is like a

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.789 
can see that that beam is like a
spotlight<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.640> mean<00:03:51.880> look<00:03:52.060> at<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.769> look<00:03:53.769> how

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
spotlight I mean look at that look how

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.319 
spotlight I mean look at that look how
far<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.459> hotspot<00:03:54.760> reaches<00:03:57.030> lighting<00:03:58.030> up<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
far that hotspot reaches lighting up the

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.000 
far that hotspot reaches lighting up the
treetops<00:03:59.760> what's<00:04:00.760> this<00:04:00.910> area<00:04:01.180> here<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.950> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
treetops what's this area here it's a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.479 
treetops what's this area here it's a
little<00:04:03.100> clearing<00:04:03.730> in<00:04:03.850> there<00:04:05.250> okay<00:04:06.250> just

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
little clearing in there okay just

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.420 
little clearing in there okay just
walking<00:04:07.000> back<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.600> bike<00:04:08.130> might<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.280> well

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
walking back to the bike might as well

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.509 
walking back to the bike might as well
film<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.940> there's<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.239> bike<00:04:10.540> over<00:04:10.720> there<00:04:11.519> okay

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
film it there's a bike over there okay

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.940 
film it there's a bike over there okay
so<00:04:12.579> this<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.209> pretty<00:04:13.630> awesome<00:04:13.750> light<00:04:14.620> I

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
so this is a pretty awesome light I

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.030 
so this is a pretty awesome light I
definitely<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:16.540> what<00:04:17.260> they've<00:04:17.530> done<00:04:17.829> with

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
definitely like what they've done with

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.270 
definitely like what they've done with
this<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.549> mean<00:04:18.760> as<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.720> said<00:04:20.109> they<00:04:20.799> basically

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
this I mean as I said they basically

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.340 
this I mean as I said they basically
took<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:22.479> light<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:23.020> TN<00:04:23.350> 12<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:25.229> put<00:04:26.229> it

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
took this light to TN 12 and they put it

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.219 
took this light to TN 12 and they put it
on<00:04:26.500> steroids<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.370> mean<00:04:27.550> they<00:04:27.669> give<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.229> twice

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
on steroids I mean they give you twice

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.280 
on steroids I mean they give you twice
the<00:04:29.290> battery<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:30.729> twice<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> batteries<00:04:31.750> for

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
the battery like twice the batteries for

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.159 
the battery like twice the batteries for
more<00:04:32.500> runtime<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.580> look<00:04:34.390> I<00:04:34.630> mean<00:04:34.810> look<00:04:35.020> how

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
more runtime and look I mean look how

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.529 
more runtime and look I mean look how
much<00:04:35.349> bigger<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.070> reflector<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:36.880> so<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.510> I

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
much bigger the reflector is so that I

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.690 
much bigger the reflector is so that I
don't<00:04:37.840> want<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.050> blind<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.650> look<00:04:39.190> at<00:04:39.370> how<00:04:39.520> much

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
don't want to blind you look at how much

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.830 
don't want to blind you look at how much
bigger<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
bigger the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.370 
bigger the
is<00:04:41.199> just<00:04:41.530> more<00:04:42.400> diameter<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.419> deeper<00:04:43.870> as<00:04:44.020> well

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
is just more diameter and deeper as well

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.300 
is just more diameter and deeper as well
and<00:04:44.770> because<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.520> giganto<00:04:46.330> reflector

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and because of that giganto reflector

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.719 
and because of that giganto reflector
they<00:04:48.310> say<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.850> lei<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.330> specially<00:04:49.990> made<00:04:50.020> for

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
they say this lei is specially made for

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.129 
they say this lei is specially made for
search-and-rescue<00:04:52.680> hunting<00:04:53.680> or<00:04:55.020> mounting<00:04:56.020> on

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
search-and-rescue hunting or mounting on

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.430 
search-and-rescue hunting or mounting on
a<00:04:56.169> firearm<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.160> know<00:04:57.970> for<00:04:58.270> security<00:04:58.840> purposes

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
a firearm you know for security purposes

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.760 
a firearm you know for security purposes
as<00:04:59.650> well<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.880> lumens<00:05:01.360> max<00:05:02.020> lumens<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:03.330> 975

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
as well the lumens max lumens is 975

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
as well the lumens max lumens is 975
however<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:07.180> know<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.510> around<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.020> same

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
however you know it's around the same

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.700 
however you know it's around the same
max<00:05:08.560> lumens<00:05:09.040> as<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:09.690> but<00:05:10.690> lumens<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.320> not<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
max lumens as this but lumens is not the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.190 
max lumens as this but lumens is not the
only<00:05:11.949> thing<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.580> know<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.510> defines<00:05:13.990> a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
only thing you know that defines a

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.100 
only thing you know that defines a
flashlight<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.220> said<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:16.300> reflector

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
flashlight as I said that reflector

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.280 
flashlight as I said that reflector
gives<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.830> much<00:05:17.979> more<00:05:18.220> range<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.970> much

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
gives you so much more range a much

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.710 
gives you so much more range a much
tighter<00:05:20.290> hot<00:05:20.710> spot<00:05:21.190> yeah<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.270> see<00:05:22.570> that

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
tighter hot spot yeah so you see that

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.379 
tighter hot spot yeah so you see that
hot<00:05:23.020> spot<00:05:23.290> I<00:05:23.650> mean<00:05:23.680> it<00:05:24.130> has<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> very<00:05:24.880> intense

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
hot spot I mean it has a very intense

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.890 
hot spot I mean it has a very intense
hot<00:05:25.720> spot<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.590> over<00:05:26.950> longer<00:05:27.400> ranges<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.750> know

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
hot spot so over longer ranges you know

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.840 
hot spot so over longer ranges you know
that<00:05:29.110> hot<00:05:29.470> spot<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.010> essentially<00:05:30.580> going<00:05:30.760> to

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
that hot spot is essentially going to

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.080 
that hot spot is essentially going to
bracket<00:05:31.350> bracket<00:05:32.350> your<00:05:32.860> target<00:05:33.400> for<00:05:33.639> you

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
bracket bracket your target for you

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.620 
bracket bracket your target for you
as<00:05:34.389> for<00:05:34.870> operation<00:05:35.470> very<00:05:35.770> simple<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.430> has

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
as for operation very simple it has

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.300 
as for operation very simple it has
right<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.840> tail<00:05:38.080> switch<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.620> has<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:38.830> memory

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
right the tail switch it has a memory

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.180 
right the tail switch it has a memory
function<00:05:39.910> so<00:05:40.120> it'll<00:05:40.360> turn<00:05:40.570> it'll<00:05:41.530> turn<00:05:41.740> on<00:05:41.800> in

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
function so it'll turn it'll turn on in

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.570 
function so it'll turn it'll turn on in
whatever<00:05:42.430> mode<00:05:42.910> you<00:05:43.120> turned<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.600> off<00:05:43.780> in<00:05:44.139> and

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
whatever mode you turned it off in and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.640 
whatever mode you turned it off in and
once<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.729> is<00:05:45.760> on<00:05:46.320> there's<00:05:47.320> five<00:05:47.620> different

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
once it is on there's five different

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.520 
once it is on there's five different
modes<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.669> brightness<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.479> one<00:05:49.720> stroke

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
modes of brightness and one stroke

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.719 
modes of brightness and one stroke
yeah<00:05:51.340> there's<00:05:51.580> moonlight<00:05:54.600> up<00:05:55.600> to<00:05:55.930> turbo<00:05:56.200> and

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
yeah there's moonlight up to turbo and

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.270 
yeah there's moonlight up to turbo and
their<00:05:57.729> stroke<00:05:59.700> and<00:06:00.700> to<00:06:00.910> get<00:06:01.090> that<00:06:01.270> stroke<00:06:02.280> you

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
their stroke and to get that stroke you

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.029 
their stroke and to get that stroke you
just<00:06:03.610> do<00:06:04.450> a<00:06:04.479> long<00:06:04.840> press<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:05.260> you'll<00:06:05.650> get<00:06:05.860> the

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
just do a long press and you'll get the

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.940 
just do a long press and you'll get the
strobe<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:07.150> it's<00:06:07.300> also<00:06:07.510> very<00:06:07.950> flexible

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
strobe and it's also very flexible

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.279 
strobe and it's also very flexible
because<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.400> can<00:06:09.580> take<00:06:09.820> out<00:06:10.080> right<00:06:11.080> the

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
because you can take out right the

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.140 
because you can take out right the
battery<00:06:11.680> tube<00:06:11.889> extension<00:06:12.370> if<00:06:12.639> you<00:06:12.760> need<00:06:13.000> this

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
battery tube extension if you need this

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.570 
battery tube extension if you need this
to<00:06:13.360> be<00:06:13.389> shorter<00:06:14.050> right<00:06:14.800> if<00:06:14.889> you<00:06:15.010> need<00:06:15.220> this<00:06:15.370> to

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
to be shorter right if you need this to

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.700 
to be shorter right if you need this to
be<00:06:15.610> shorter<00:06:16.180> but<00:06:16.330> still<00:06:16.389> have<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.810> lot<00:06:17.110> of<00:06:17.139> throw

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
be shorter but still have a lot of throw

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.370 
be shorter but still have a lot of throw
you<00:06:18.490> know<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:18.820> is<00:06:19.000> not<00:06:19.150> specifically<00:06:20.080> made

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
you know this is not specifically made

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.200 
you know this is not specifically made
to<00:06:21.090> function<00:06:22.090> as<00:06:22.479> a<00:06:22.510> bludgeon<00:06:23.430> but<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:25.120> know

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
to function as a bludgeon but you know

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.760 
to function as a bludgeon but you know
just<00:06:25.389> the<00:06:25.599> reach<00:06:25.840> of<00:06:25.870> it<00:06:26.200> I<00:06:26.289> mean<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.590> could

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
just the reach of it I mean you could

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.390 
just the reach of it I mean you could
see<00:06:27.039> in<00:06:27.310> an<00:06:27.760> emergency<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:29.830> know<00:06:29.950> that<00:06:30.130> could

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
see in an emergency you know that could

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.490 
see in an emergency you know that could
be<00:06:30.550> quite<00:06:30.789> useful<00:06:30.820> having<00:06:31.450> a<00:06:31.720> light<00:06:31.930> this<00:06:32.229> long

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
be quite useful having a light this long

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.310 
be quite useful having a light this long
like<00:06:32.800> I<00:06:32.830> said<00:06:33.250> you<00:06:33.970> know<00:06:34.090> not<00:06:34.660> specifically

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
like I said you know not specifically

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.520 
like I said you know not specifically
meant<00:06:35.710> as<00:06:35.919> a<00:06:35.950> as<00:06:36.280> a<00:06:36.669> club<00:06:37.180> but<00:06:37.599> but<00:06:38.080> yeah<00:06:38.410> I<00:06:38.440> mean

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
meant as a as a club but but yeah I mean

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.860 
meant as a as a club but but yeah I mean
that<00:06:38.770> could<00:06:39.070> that<00:06:39.400> could<00:06:39.460> have<00:06:39.789> some<00:06:40.060> uses<00:06:40.599> and

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
that could that could have some uses and

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.790 
that could that could have some uses and
it's<00:06:41.500> got<00:06:41.710> more<00:06:42.220> than<00:06:42.280> a<00:06:42.610> two<00:06:42.910> hour<00:06:43.180> runtime<00:06:43.800> in

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
it's got more than a two hour runtime in

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.790 
it's got more than a two hour runtime in
turbo<00:06:45.729> okay<00:06:46.660> that's<00:06:46.960> the<00:06:47.169> benefit<00:06:47.620> of<00:06:47.680> that

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
turbo okay that's the benefit of that

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.159 
turbo okay that's the benefit of that
extension<00:06:48.460> more<00:06:48.940> than<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.270> two<00:06:49.479> hour<00:06:49.690> runtime

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
extension more than a two hour runtime

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.700 
extension more than a two hour runtime
in<00:06:50.770> turbo<00:06:51.760> mode<00:06:51.789> that's<00:06:52.479> crazy

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
in turbo mode that's crazy

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.409 
in turbo mode that's crazy
