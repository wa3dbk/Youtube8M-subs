flight<00:03:02.650> into<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> corner<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.390> want

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
flight into the corner and then you want

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.360 
flight into the corner and then you want

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
to hold the target button and look down

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.539 
to hold the target button and look down

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
so when he spawns you should come target

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.750 
so when he spawns you should come target
and<00:03:09.700> hold<00:03:09.940> forward<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:12.370> that's<00:03:12.519> it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
and hold forward and that's that's it

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.240 
and hold forward and that's that's it
guys<00:03:12.910> simple<00:03:13.780> as<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.349> it's<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:14.830> easy

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
guys simple as that so it's really easy

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.490

to<00:03:17.590> get<00:03:17.709> 10<00:03:17.890> kill<00:03:18.070> streak<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.489> recon<00:03:19.000> drop

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
to get 10 kill streak with a recon drop

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.590
