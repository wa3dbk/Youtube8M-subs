00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 here in the recording studio of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 pm positive music school of Rome for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.830
 present you this guitar which is a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 eco evo 0 18 the series vo is part of the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.080
 new catalog of eco 2014 that is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.779
 was presented at the nab of los angeles a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 January and was entirely designed e 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 designed by massimo varini as written 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 indeed in the catalog and in 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.120
 every guitar concept vision and design 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.520
 by massimo varini eco guitars woods 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 used are solid cedar for the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 top magano laminated for bottom and sides 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
 also the mahogany handle while the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 rosewood fingerboard plus woods 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 they have been seasoned in four 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 different steps during construction 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.980
 of the guitar the open port finish 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.290
 ie unpainted open pore allows 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 in addition to the wood to vibrate freely 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 without being weighed down precisely by 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.729
 paint let's see the dimensions 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.490
 of this guitar the scale is short 630 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.830
 mm which results in the strings of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.229
 addario factory 0 12 really a lot 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 soft to be 0 12 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.240
 the lowered thickness is very important 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.040
 let's go from 82 to 102 mm then one 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
 very comfortable guitar very wearable 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.439
 both because he uses it sitting and for whom 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.329
 sounds standing and the thickness at the nath is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.630
 of 42 mm the rosette is in wood and le 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.540
 mechanical parts are made entirely of metal 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.930
 another novelty of this catalog is 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.399
 the former echoed this fishman 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 guitar mounts the isis prices model 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.759
 301 that precisely with an equalizer e 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.689
 chromatic tuner that works a lot 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.670
 well the jack jack and moved here more 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.890
 low compared to the pin tears a thing 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 which I personally find very comfortable and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700
 next to the jack there is the seat 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.129
 the usual nine-goal battery if 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.830
 let's listen to the guitar now 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.930
 I will play on a bass and drums base 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 first I 'll play straming 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.270
 using a dunlop plectrum in 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 celluloid 0 50 mm we will take the sound 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.100
 both from the jack output via one of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 in the pits both from this microphone a 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 capacitor and will be shown in the video 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.830
 when the sound you hear is that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.830
 precisely the dia and the microphone 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.450
 now I'll always play on the same base 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.859
 but a part in arpeggio using a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.870
 plectrum always of the dunlop in 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.200
 celluloid with a thickness of about one 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 millimeter 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.519
 now 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.400
 to play a solo part using a 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.290
 the spi of coconut is much thicker 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.290
 then in coconut of the stp 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.970
 so far we've heard the guitar on 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.280
 a base of bass and battery 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.320
 let's go now to hear how it is 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.320
 involves in a guitar solo context 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.010
 so we saw a guitar that is 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.340
 behaves very well in the parts in 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.410
 straming not discounted for 1 0 18 e 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.970
 which certainly gives the best of itself in the 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.640
 arpeggiated parts or even in 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.650
 fingerpicking flatpicking a tool 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.400
 which I think has no rival in his 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.400
 price range
