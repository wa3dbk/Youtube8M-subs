00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.109
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.440
 This theme is 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.140
 Stop up servings short 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.500
 I will try to do about the point 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.199
 It is difficult to stop the up serve 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.519
 It will turn up if it hits it because it is upper rotation 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 Or by saying that you fly away 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.810
 It is hard to stop, but remember this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.609
 When you get an up serve during the game 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.509
 If you can do it at least one game, it will be quite effective 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:39.160
 I can advance 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.000
 The other party is up-minded 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 Waiting for a long receive and want to attack the third ball 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.030
 Most of the time I think 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.940
 So I'm thinking of hitting the third ball Bitter 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.410
 I can not hit the third ball if it is stopped 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.801
 Up serve to this player 

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.680
 The sense that it does not work so much 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.170
 If you can plant it, then the service will be 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.600
 Because there is also the possibility of becoming monotonous 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.930
 I think I want you to remember by all means 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.910
 It will be the best receive to remove the other party's wait 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.750
 I will explain the point 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.500
 The first point is vertical racket 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.409
 Please hold on When stopping normally 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.990
 When stopping the lower rotation serve 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.220
 It's a top-end but I'm up-served 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 It will float when it turns up 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.510
 I'm going up so I can't 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.140
 Please vertical Please the second point 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.799
 Your opponent's serve bounces once 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.220
 Aim for the moment you fell down Here after bouncing 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.860
 If you do not take it firmly, the hit point will bounce and the hit point will 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.640
 It becomes easy to float up when it rises 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.479
 Because I will 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.330
 The moment I fell down 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.150
 It is the timing, being aware of this 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.580
 Please try to take a third point 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.900
 It is how to swing, but how to swing 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.350
 Please try to swing sideways 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.569
 If you say this why and swing to the front 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.550
 For up-served coming 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.730
 It's easy to get out of the stand because it's hit hard with bread 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.940
 I'm going to go ahead and have the power 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.220
 Because it is a strong serve, it affects it 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.970
 It is an image that moves sideways so as not to receive power 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670
 When you do it with such an image 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.210
 It is these three points that I think it is easy to stop 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.790
 Especially where you can catch it at the moment it fell 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 You won't succeed unless you enter quickly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.010
 Please practice while being aware of that area 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.030
 So here are the three points actually 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.830
 As we tried practice, please see
