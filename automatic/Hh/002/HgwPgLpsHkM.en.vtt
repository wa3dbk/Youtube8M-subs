00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
plate off on a lot of engines it'll

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
plate off on a lot of engines it'll
break<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> skirt<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> piston<00:01:55.770> off<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
break the skirt of the piston off so you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.440 
break the skirt of the piston off so you
want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.460> sure<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.759> piston<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.299> up

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
want to make sure the piston is up

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.359 
want to make sure the piston is up
towards<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.439> top<00:01:58.500> doesn't<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.250> all

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
towards the top doesn't have to be all

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
towards the top doesn't have to be all
the<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.610> now<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.750> these<00:02:00.869> back<00:02:01.140> plates

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the way now some of these back plates

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
the way now some of these back plates
got<00:02:01.560> pretty<00:02:01.799> tight<00:02:01.950> o-ring<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> alphas<00:02:03.119> got

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
got pretty tight o-ring these alphas got

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
got pretty tight o-ring these alphas got
pre-title<00:02:03.719> rings<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.130> turn

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
pre-title rings so all you just turn

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.760 
pre-title rings so all you just turn
that<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> side<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.200> then

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that to the side a little bit and then

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.529 
that to the side a little bit and then
it<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.369> better<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> use<00:02:08.729> plastic<00:02:09.360> or

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
it would be better to use plastic or

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.070 
it would be better to use plastic or
brass<00:02:10.080> or<00:02:10.410> aluminum<00:02:10.440> here

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
brass or aluminum here

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.720 
brass or aluminum here
but<00:02:11.200> these<00:02:11.650> usually<00:02:11.860> don't<00:02:12.160> mark<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.580> very

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
but these usually don't mark it up very

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.290 
but these usually don't mark it up very
much<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.120> give<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.540> bit<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.900> a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
much you just give a little bit of a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.490 
much you just give a little bit of a
ridge<00:02:16.300> there<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.660> once<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.900> get<00:02:16.990> that<00:02:17.170> far

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
ridge there and once you get that far

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.570 
ridge there and once you get that far
you<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.800> that's<00:02:21.280> what

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
you just get that out and that's what

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.340 
you just get that out and that's what
we'll<00:02:21.790> catch<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.180> bottom<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.600> piston

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
we'll catch the bottom with a piston

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
we'll catch the bottom with a piston
right<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.830> break<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> skirt<00:02:24.850> every

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
right there and break the skirt every

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.750 
right there and break the skirt every
time<00:02:25.680> you're<00:02:26.680> talking<00:02:26.830> 100<00:02:27.280> dollars<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.640> most

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
time you're talking 100 dollars and most

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.900 
time you're talking 100 dollars and most
engines<00:02:28.180> -<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.960> because<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.380> mistake

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
engines - just because of that mistake

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.710 
engines - just because of that mistake
so<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:31.210> once<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.980> plate<00:02:33.220> off

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
so then once you have the back plate off

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.770 
so then once you have the back plate off
sleeve<00:02:34.720> out<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.710> grab<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.190> piston

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
sleeve out you can just grab the piston

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.370 
sleeve out you can just grab the piston
rod<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:40.270> kind<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.600> wiggle<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:40.930> off<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> little

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
rod just kind of wiggle it off a little

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.020 
rod just kind of wiggle it off a little
bit<00:02:41.560> there<00:02:41.830> off<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.400> crank<00:02:42.670> pin<00:02:45.030> piston

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
bit there off to the crank pin piston

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.340 
bit there off to the crank pin piston
comes<00:02:46.210> out<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.100> then<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.640> crank<00:02:48.910> last<00:02:49.350> just

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
comes out and then the crank last just

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.780 
comes out and then the crank last just
pushes<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.830> from<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> back<00:02:53.340> sometimes<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
pushes out from the back sometimes it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.340 
pushes out from the back sometimes it
does<00:02:54.940> require<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.360> little<00:02:55.540> bit<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.750> tapping<00:02:56.230> on

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
does require a little bit of tapping on

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.410 
does require a little bit of tapping on
a<00:02:56.410> Banshee<00:02:57.010> trying<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.520> something<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.300> know

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
a Banshee trying you something you know

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.230 
a Banshee trying you something you know
wood<00:02:58.720> or<00:02:58.959> something<00:02:59.520> it<00:03:00.520> can<00:03:00.760> be<00:03:00.880> hard<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
wood or something it can be hard on the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.320 
wood or something it can be hard on the
bearings<00:03:01.570> also<00:03:02.910> another<00:03:03.910> thing<00:03:04.120> too<00:03:04.300> is

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
bearings also another thing too is

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.760 
bearings also another thing too is
carburetors<00:03:04.990> guys<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.320> trouble<00:03:05.709> getting

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
carburetors guys have trouble getting

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.830 
carburetors guys have trouble getting
the<00:03:05.920> carburetors<00:03:06.400> out<00:03:06.550> though<00:03:06.760> twist<00:03:07.540> on

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the carburetors out though twist on

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.900 
the carburetors out though twist on
these<00:03:08.050> things<00:03:08.280> what<00:03:09.280> I've<00:03:09.370> found<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.850> best

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
these things what I've found the best

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.470 
these things what I've found the best
way<00:03:10.240> is<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.990> loosen<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:12.180> loosen<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.270> car

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
way is to just loosen the loosen the car

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.770 
way is to just loosen the loosen the car
bolt<00:03:13.750> get<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.920> wrap<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:16.420> pushes

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
bolt get this little wrap that pushes

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.080 
bolt get this little wrap that pushes
the<00:03:16.900> back<00:03:17.050> side<00:03:17.350> all<00:03:18.510> pushes<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:20.850> pinch<00:03:21.850> bolt

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
the back side all pushes the pinch bolt

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.870 
the back side all pushes the pinch bolt
on<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.360> side<00:03:22.570> out<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.840> then<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.380> turn

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
on this side out and then as you turn

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.400 
on this side out and then as you turn
this<00:03:24.880> way<00:03:25.060> it'll<00:03:25.209> unwedge<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.019> one<00:03:26.140> on<00:03:26.290> this

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
this way it'll unwedge the one on this

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.780 
this way it'll unwedge the one on this
side<00:03:27.989> which<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.140> did<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:29.519> another<00:03:30.519> way<00:03:30.730> to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
side which it did there another way to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.600 
side which it did there another way to
is<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.360> get<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.380> loosen<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.310> way<00:03:33.459> up

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
is that get this loosen all the way up

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.210 
is that get this loosen all the way up
get<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.970> side<00:03:34.959> out<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.350> then<00:03:35.440> take<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> wrench

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
get this side out and then take a wrench

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.520 
get this side out and then take a wrench
and<00:03:36.400> tap<00:03:36.760> out<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.510> both<00:03:37.780> sides<00:03:37.989> out<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:39.000> then

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and tap out get both sides out and then

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.080 
and tap out get both sides out and then
then<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.650> usually<00:03:41.830> comes<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.370> with<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:42.850> little

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
then it usually comes out with a little

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.090 
then it usually comes out with a little
twisting<00:03:43.480> action<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:45.130> about<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:47.100> proper

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
twisting action that's about it proper

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.470 
twisting action that's about it proper
