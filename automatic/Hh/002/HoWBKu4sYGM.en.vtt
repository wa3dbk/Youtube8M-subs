too I was a big fan of the original game
and<00:00:10.610> I<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:12.120> saddened<00:00:12.389> when<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.929> company<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
was it earlier this year but they've

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
was it earlier this year but they've
apparently<00:00:19.350> got<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> same<00:00:20.220> producer<00:00:20.640> from

hoping<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.170> good<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.529> better

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
hoping it's a just as good if not better

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.590 
hoping it's a just as good if not better
than<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:30.019> all<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.199> I'm<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:32.329> yep<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
than the first all right I'm in yep you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.729 
than the first all right I'm in yep you
can<00:00:33.780> jump<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.980> shallow<00:00:35.280> um<00:00:36.590> okay<00:00:37.590> it's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
can jump but it's a shallow um okay it's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
can jump but it's a shallow um okay it's
a<00:00:37.829> little<00:00:38.100> less<00:00:38.430> shallow<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.030> jump

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
a little less shallow when you jump

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
a little less shallow when you jump
straight<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.870> jumping<00:00:40.140> across<00:00:40.379> things

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
straight up but jumping across things

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
straight up but jumping across things
you're<00:00:41.790> way<00:00:41.940> better<00:00:42.149> off<00:00:42.300> using<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> bionic

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you're way better off using the bionic

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
you're way better off using the bionic
arm<00:00:43.379> still<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.309> reach

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
arm still you can get a lot more reach

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
arm still you can get a lot more reach
on<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.260> few<00:00:49.410> seconds<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
on it just a few seconds in there

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
already requesting a little bit more

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.689

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
game and I'm already kind of wishing

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.850 
game and I'm already kind of wishing
there<00:01:16.590> wasn't<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> jump<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.259> graphics<00:01:19.500> are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
there wasn't a jump but the graphics are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.950 
there wasn't a jump but the graphics are
better<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:21.000> ground<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.659> lot

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
better there's a lot for ground a lot

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.520 
better there's a lot for ground a lot
more<00:01:22.140> foreground<00:01:22.680> activity<00:01:24.200> feels<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.470> like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
more foreground activity feels more like

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.929 
more foreground activity feels more like
a<00:01:25.710> full<00:01:26.340> world<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.970> opposed<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> flat<00:01:27.720> world

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
a full world as opposed to a flat world

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.620 
a full world as opposed to a flat world
see<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.090> background<00:01:30.479> activity<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:32.630> yeah

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
see some background activity there yeah

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
see some background activity there yeah
the<00:01:33.780> graphics<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.470> definitely<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> step<00:01:35.369> up

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the graphics are definitely a step up

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.820 
the graphics are definitely a step up
the<00:01:35.909> character<00:01:36.420> models<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> lot<00:01:36.960> better<00:01:37.140> too
