thought were human beings but

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.259 
thought were human beings but

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
and especially when we're talking about

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.170 
and especially when we're talking about
what<00:00:49.360> God<00:00:49.930> has<00:00:49.960> commissioned<00:00:50.890> us<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.129> do<00:00:51.790> and

what God has commissioned us to do and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.880 
what God has commissioned us to do and
