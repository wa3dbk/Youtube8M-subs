turn that into a true bedside activity

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.299 
turn that into a true bedside activity
and<00:01:01.379> bedside<00:01:02.100> measurement<00:01:03.710> our<00:01:04.710> chip<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and bedside measurement our chip is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
and bedside measurement our chip is
designed<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

small amount of blood from the patient

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
small amount of blood from the patient
and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.869> specifically<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and then they can just specifically just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.760 
and then they can just specifically just
pick<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:15.119> particular<00:01:15.509> immune<00:01:16.200> cell<00:01:16.439> type

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
pick up some particular immune cell type

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.969 
pick up some particular immune cell type
we<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.580> stimulate<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> cells<00:01:19.470> on

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
we can stimulate these in the cells on

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.899 
we can stimulate these in the cells on
the<00:01:20.610> chip<00:01:20.880> using<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:22.340> chemical<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.580> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the chip using some chemical which just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
the chip using some chemical which just
the<00:01:24.060> mimicking<00:01:24.540> some<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.990> viral<00:01:25.320> attack<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the mimicking some a viral attack and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.660 
the mimicking some a viral attack and
then<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.540> optically<00:01:28.380> detect<00:01:28.950> really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
then we can just optically detect really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
then we can just optically detect really
accurate<00:01:30.240> information<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.680> immune<00:01:32.100> see

ideas I'm very excited about this
project<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.769> feel<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.610> our

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
project because we can feel that our

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.140 
project because we can feel that our
engineering<00:02:28.110> skills<00:02:28.680> were<00:02:29.250> technology<00:02:29.940> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
engineering skills were technology that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.630 
engineering skills were technology that
we<00:02:30.480> are<00:02:30.780> developing<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.099> have<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we are developing here are really have a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.420 
we are developing here are really have a
huge<00:02:32.940> impact<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.930> clinical<00:02:34.319> applications<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
huge impact on clinical applications and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.229 
huge impact on clinical applications and
that<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.120> feel<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.019> are<00:02:37.049> contributing<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
that we feel that we are contributing to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.520 
that we feel that we are contributing to
the<00:02:39.239> development<00:02:39.870> or<00:02:40.310> advancement<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.519> new

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the development or advancement of new

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.220 
the development or advancement of new
medical<00:02:43.530> technologies<00:02:44.280> which<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.659> hope<00:02:45.930> will

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
medical technologies which we hope will

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.360 
medical technologies which we hope will
save<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:47.040> lot<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.310> patients<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.829> babies<00:02:49.829> who

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
save a lot of patients and babies who

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.079 
save a lot of patients and babies who
are<00:02:50.430> suffering<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:51.030> infectious<00:02:51.480> diseases
