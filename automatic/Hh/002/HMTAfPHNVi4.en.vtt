00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 two 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.820
 my name is juan soler explorer and 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.469
 adventurous for 20 years I have traveled all 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.020
 the continent discovering places 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.000
 magical and incredible but I have also 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.010
 had to face high situations 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.630
 risk that I can raffle thanks to my 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
 experience and knowledge of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 basic survival techniques 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 now I want to teach some of your 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 survival tips which will 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 they can save their lives when they face 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.680
 an emergency at the least 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.680
 expected 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.210
 today I am in a forest in the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.309
 high concentrations of water in the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.620
 environment the climate can be quite 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.840
 unpredictable the mountainous environment can 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.120
 be dangerous because of the elevation already 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.430
 the difficult of the terrain between more height 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.650
 lower temperature this increases the risk 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.750
 of suffering hypothermia freezing and bad 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.980
 of height the ability to light and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.930
 keeping fire can be a factor 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.430
 psychological determinant at the time of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 survive the three elements 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.559
 primordials of fire are oxygen heat 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.870
 and fuel once the fire is lit 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.970
 you will have to have enough at hand 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 fuel by wood dry leaves 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.930
 to keep the fire alive now 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.789
 I will teach you towards the fire with the paper 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.560
 metalized and a chewing gum and batteries 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.149
 mini internal metallic foil 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.220
 chewing gum will serve as driver of 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.320
 electricity and combustion source and the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.330
 battery power will provide the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.430
 heat source first put the batteries 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.110
 on a piece of foil the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.300
 positive side up and the other 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.340
 down cuts the remaining paper in 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.590
 butterfly shape and with this some 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.479
 contact bridge between the strips the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 heat generated will learn the most 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.940
 thin paper with what the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 disk 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 the preparation is as important as 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.330
 our desire to survive the days that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 as bad as the picture is if you 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.180
 you keep focused and optimistic you can 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.070
 overcome any obstacle 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.440
 come back soon with another capsule 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.010
 experience here the moment of discovery 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.010
 with one soles
