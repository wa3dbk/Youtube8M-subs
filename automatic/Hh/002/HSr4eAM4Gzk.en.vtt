00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
this this is a game I think they could

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
this this is a game I think they could
go<00:00:58.820> 1-nil<00:00:59.149> yeah<00:00:59.329> yeah<00:00:59.780> don't<00:01:00.199> think<00:01:00.530> that's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
go 1-nil yeah yeah don't think that's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.900 
go 1-nil yeah yeah don't think that's
going<00:01:00.859> to<00:01:00.920> make<00:01:01.039> too<00:01:01.219> much<00:01:01.339> difference<00:01:01.399> when

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
going to make too much difference when

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.810 
going to make too much difference when
you've<00:01:02.030> got<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.210> armory<00:01:02.659> in<00:01:02.780> there<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.409> their

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
you've got the armory in there in their

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.130 
you've got the armory in there in their

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.480 
know I got it I think so Alex got the
team<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.290> only<00:01:45.500> way<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.740> maniac<00:01:46.070> don't<00:01:46.310> play

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
team the only way that maniac don't play

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.220 
team the only way that maniac don't play
well<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.790> when<00:01:46.940> he<00:01:47.030> gets<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.630> team<00:01:47.840> formation

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
well is when he gets the team formation

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.780 
well is when he gets the team formation
wrong<00:01:48.590> but<00:01:48.860> he<00:01:48.950> sets<00:01:49.190> them<00:01:49.340> up<00:01:49.490> wrongly

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
wrong but he sets them up wrongly

next<00:02:50.300> get<00:02:50.600> you've<00:02:50.720> got<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> thing<00:02:51.110> rolled<00:02:51.320> on

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
next get you've got a thing rolled on

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.810 
next get you've got a thing rolled on
we've<00:02:51.560> got<00:02:51.680> main<00:02:51.830> city<00:02:52.130> he's<00:02:52.310> taking<00:02:52.700> me<00:02:52.790> off

because<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.050> only<00:02:54.200> one

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
because of that I think the only one

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.230 
because of that I think the only one
problem<00:02:54.770> i<00:02:54.980> see<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.400> many<00:02:55.550> light<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:55.970> year

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
problem i see for many light this year

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.330 
problem i see for many light this year
is<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.020> loss<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.350> Rooney<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.710> just<00:02:58.100> think<00:02:58.280> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
is the loss of Rooney I just think that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.070 
is the loss of Rooney I just think that
that<00:02:58.580> would<00:02:58.730> leave<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> massive<00:02:59.450> hole<00:02:59.630> for<00:02:59.900> them

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that would leave a massive hole for them

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.050 
that would leave a massive hole for them
so<00:03:00.470> he's<00:03:00.620> got<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.860> be<00:03:01.130> managed<00:03:01.430> properties<00:03:01.880> got

because<00:03:51.140> we've<00:03:51.620> proposed<00:03:52.010> both<00:03:52.190> teams<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
because we've proposed both teams to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.970 
because we've proposed both teams to
score<00:03:52.750> source<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:53.990> there<00:03:54.140> are<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> lot<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.740> four

score source if there are a lot of four

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.230 
score source if there are a lot of four
words<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.160> are<00:03:55.340> out<00:03:55.459> from<00:03:55.730> whence<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.060> you've

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
also going to look at that one again so

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.320 
also going to look at that one again so
have<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> look<00:03:58.490> at<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.670> teams<00:03:58.880> before<00:03:59.030> you

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
have a look at the teams before you

actually<00:03:59.450> belt<00:03:59.810> this<00:03:59.959> game<00:04:00.170> but<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.680> is

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
actually belt this game but it is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.290 
actually belt this game but it is
undoubtedly<00:04:01.100> one<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.670> people<00:04:01.880> will<00:04:02.150> have

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
undoubtedly one that people will have

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.060 
undoubtedly one that people will have
strong<00:04:02.510> opinions<00:04:02.660> okay<00:04:03.320> so<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.560> first<00:04:03.590> bet<00:04:03.950> is

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070
