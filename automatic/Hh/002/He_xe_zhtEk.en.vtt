00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.250
 well we go back to our circle 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.110
 chromatic today we touch the colors 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.110
 cold those on this side 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.260
 the cold colors we use them 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.300
 very much very much very much and I am going to 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.610
 say why especially this piece of 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.820
 here here because these are the colors 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.809
 of the denim in front of the shake and we use 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.809
 very much the denim fabric 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.010
 we can use blue colors of very 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 varied tones combined with each other 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 and it looks very good here I would say the same 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.050
 that with the black that when you go for a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.210
 single color will bring any complement one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.799
 little breaker just to give it a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 contrast to give something fun to 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.229
 that is not too monochromatic 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 but as you can see the blue jeans 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.220
 we have them very present in our 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.799
 safe wardrobe we open the wardrobe 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.500
 and black and blue are the colors that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.730
 more predominate 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.260
 but there is another thing that has been said to 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
 times about cold colors and it's that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.380
 blue and green do not combine well 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.869
 I do not agree 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.049
 here we return to the same theory for me 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.299
 than with black and blue or with 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.850
 black and the manual everything depends on the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.920
 contrast if the blue and the green that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 we use go inside it 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 intensity of color as it will seem 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.310
 boring we did not like the combination 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.039
 but if the blue and green that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.470
 we use as here contrasts a lot the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.819
 combination will earn interest and this what 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.789
 I said in other videos about 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.700
 color combinations I insist on it 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.280
 if we combine the colors that contrast 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.920
 more we will always like the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.289
 combination but the blue and the green 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.599
 they look pretty in fact we see it in 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.240
 some patterns as I said in the 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.530
 previous video of warm colors 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.670
 starting from a pattern that has some 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.950
 colors 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.470
 What we do is continue the styling 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.780
 following those colors here the green and 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.250
 the blue are present there is even a 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.770
 little bit of beige that we can see 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.140
 shoes then are these three colors that 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.940
 she has the blouse and we set the rest 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.770
 of the combination 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.810
 we can also use the green 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.569
 simply as a stop 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.810
 here in this case we have used it in 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.599
 the shoes and in the bag and as you see 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.060
 are two shades of green and blue that 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.260
 they distinguish very well then they do not win 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.370
 our combination 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.370
 and the cold colors 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.160
 combined with white is also very 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.959
 well combined with black certainly 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.990
 but combined with white gives a lot 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.170
 feeling of freshness a lot 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.340
 as well as with the warm colors with the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.560
 white were like more were turned off plus a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.770
 to another cold colors with white 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.960
 they are greatly enhanced we can also 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.030
 add for a touch of color when 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.170
 the accessories for all 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.360
 I would enjoy in the end but you see white and 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.490
 cold is very good after all the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 bank is a cold is a cold color 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.710
 if we go to winter 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.460
 the cold colors 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.170
 with a touch of warm and in tones to the 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.450
 grays the grays could be considered 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.190
 the closer they get to the black they would be 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.160
 warmer the closer the color 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.200
 Silver would be colder 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.150
 we can play because here we have a 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.150
 little white or a darker gray and a 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.140
 gray even darker 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.400
 then the cold colors in winter all 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.819
 depends a little on what the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.349
 let's combine if we hit them a little 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.170
 make them a little warmer 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.640
 Well, we find it more, I'm telling you 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.439
 so that we do not have ideas 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.790
 preconceived of these colors are for 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.390
 the winter these colors are for the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.000
 summer 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.500
 we do not have to play always say so 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.720
 than playing with colors you have to 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.840
 combine you have to do tests and always 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.940
 try to get a little spark 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.310
 to the set that looks gracefully not 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.169
 always think of one thing if what you 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
 you have put it we photographed it in 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.699
 black and white would be the same hue 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.880
 of grays that would come out then is that 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.610
 let's go one color 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.230
 the image is god only that now if 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.210
 you think of a black and white photo of 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.130
 your styling and there would be many ranges 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.020
 of gray is that you have made a 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.409
 much more fun combination with 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.779
 much more 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:49.439
 so there you are cold warm with the 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:50.670
 white and you want us with the colors of 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.540
 7 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.540
 until next time
