00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.750 
causes it to throw up as you can see and
I<00:02:21.600> twist<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.110> section<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.250> move<00:02:23.580> on

I twist that section and then I move on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.560 
I twist that section and then I move on
to<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> next<00:02:24.120> section<00:02:26.000> alright<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.240> so

let's<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:28.560> more<00:02:28.590> time<00:02:29.480> step<00:02:30.480> one

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
let's see that one more time step one

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.940 
let's see that one more time step one
condition<00:02:32.600> step<00:02:33.600> 2<00:02:33.960> divided<00:02:34.530> hair<00:02:34.830> into

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
condition step 2 divided hair into

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.180 
condition step 2 divided hair into
sections<00:02:35.450> step<00:02:36.450> 3<00:02:36.840> divide<00:02:37.200> each<00:02:37.380> section<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
sections step 3 divide each section and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.350 
sections step 3 divide each section and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
detangle step 4 add heat protectant step

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.440 
detangle step 4 add heat protectant step
5<00:02:42.690> detangle<00:02:43.560> again<00:02:44.330> step<00:02:45.330> 6<00:02:45.720> blow-dry<00:02:46.940> step<00:02:47.940> 7

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450

detangle<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> final<00:02:49.620> time<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.400> step<00:02:51.120> 8

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
detangle for a final time and step 8

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
detangle for a final time and step 8
twist<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.930> section<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.710> you're<00:02:53.550> ready<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
twist that section and you're ready to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.170 
twist that section and you're ready to
style<00:02:54.800> for<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.460> unraveled<00:02:57.120> my

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
style for this look I unraveled my

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.050 
style for this look I unraveled my
twists<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.989> added<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.530> oil<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.250> add<00:02:59.700> chain

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
twists and I added more oil to add chain

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.090 
twists and I added more oil to add chain
because<00:03:00.270> my<00:03:00.630> hair<00:03:00.840> tends<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.350> look<00:03:01.530> dull<00:03:01.800> and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
because my hair tends to look dull and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100 
because my hair tends to look dull and
it<00:03:02.220> state<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.820> think<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.390> had<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:03.930> with

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it state I think it just had to do with

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.290 
it state I think it just had to do with
the<00:03:04.260> color<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.950> hair<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.220> dark<00:03:05.489> brown<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.209> it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
the color my hair is dark brown so it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.990 
the color my hair is dark brown so it
just<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.810> looks<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.550> dull<00:03:08.550> Brown

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
just kind of looks like the dull Brown

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.870 
just kind of looks like the dull Brown
so<00:03:09.600> after<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.500> spread<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.130> oil<00:03:11.160> throughout<00:03:11.670> my

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
so after I spread the oil throughout my

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.990 
so after I spread the oil throughout my
hair<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.480> start<00:03:12.900> picking<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.380> out<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.970> make<00:03:14.970> sure

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
hair I start picking it out I make sure

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
hair I start picking it out I make sure
to<00:03:15.330> be<00:03:15.450> very<00:03:15.720> gentle<00:03:16.050> because<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.680> hair<00:03:16.890> tends

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
to be very gentle because my hair tends

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.280 
to be very gentle because my hair tends
to<00:03:17.370> shed<00:03:17.640> more<00:03:17.910> easily<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.720> state<00:03:18.989> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
to shed more easily in this state and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.190 
to shed more easily in this state and
also<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.130> gets<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.550> tangled<00:03:21.180> at<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.600> end<00:03:21.780> so

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
also it gets more tangled at the end so

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.860 
also it gets more tangled at the end so
I<00:03:22.230> don't<00:03:22.650> blow<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:23.100> my<00:03:23.130> hair<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.610> often<00:03:24.360> this

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
I don't blow out my hair very often this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080 
I don't blow out my hair very often this
is<00:03:25.019> actually<00:03:25.560> only<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.100> second<00:03:26.610> time<00:03:26.820> I've

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
is actually only the second time I've

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.460 
is actually only the second time I've
blown<00:03:27.300> out<00:03:27.480> my<00:03:27.630> hair<00:03:27.870> since<00:03:28.110> I've<00:03:28.290> been

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
blown out my hair since I've been

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.340 
blown out my hair since I've been
natural<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:30.030> hit<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.660> year<00:03:30.840> mark<00:03:30.870> on

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
hair when it's this big is a lot of fun

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.920 
hair when it's this big is a lot of fun
and<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.370> was<00:03:38.910> thinking<00:03:38.970> about<00:03:39.390> wearing<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.810> like

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930

and I was thinking about wearing it like
this<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:41.010> decided<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.320> just<00:03:43.830> add

a<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.550> bit<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.910> gel<00:03:45.269> because<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.660> wanted

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
a little bit of gel because I wanted

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
a little bit of gel because I wanted
everything<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.410> look<00:03:46.800> real<00:03:47.310> slick<00:03:47.760> around<00:03:48.090> my

little<00:03:51.360> bit<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.600> baby<00:03:51.810> hair<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.100> then<00:03:53.310> I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
little bit of baby hair and so then I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.850

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.110 

and<00:04:29.840> then<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:31.260> use<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> toothbrush<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.550> sculpt<00:04:32.940> my

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
edges and I add a head scarf because I

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.690 
edges and I add a head scarf because I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
found out that if I just add a head

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.129 
found out that if I just add a head
scarf<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.419> little<00:04:39.570> while<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.400> really

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
scarf for a little while that it really

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.280 
scarf for a little while that it really
makes<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.260> big<00:04:43.290> difference<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.630> while<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.840> hit<00:04:46.110> my
