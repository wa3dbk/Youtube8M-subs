call of duty and the only time I've

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
call of duty and the only time I've
actually<00:02:12.270> played<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> game<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.110> real

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
actually played the game for real

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.920 
actually played the game for real
is<00:02:13.799> when<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> ranked<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:15.150> hardcore<00:02:15.690> mode

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is when I ranked up to get hardcore mode

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.820 
is when I ranked up to get hardcore mode
and<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:17.010> video<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.670> put<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.299> my<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.480> channel

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and that video I put on my other channel

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.199 
and that video I put on my other channel
which<00:02:19.830> are<00:02:20.010> done<00:02:20.099> surprisingly

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
which are done surprisingly

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.420 
which are done surprisingly
okay<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:22.170> great<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.250> check<00:02:23.400> that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
okay not great but you can check that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.880 
okay not great but you can check that
video<00:02:23.640> out<00:02:23.849> on<00:02:24.269> my<00:02:24.540> other<00:02:24.750> channel<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.349> shall

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
video out on my other channel I shall

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.820 
video out on my other channel I shall

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
put a link in the description anyway I'm

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.949 
put a link in the description anyway I'm
looking<00:02:29.220> forward<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.549> modern<00:02:30.090> warfare<00:02:30.329> free

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
looking forward to modern warfare free

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.869 
looking forward to modern warfare free
so<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.560> hoping<00:02:32.040> that's<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.700> good

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
so I'm hoping that's going to be good

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.390 
so I'm hoping that's going to be good
for<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.629> do<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:34.590> grief<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.250> that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
for what I do not grief in and that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.789 
for what I do not grief in and that
although<00:02:35.970> I've<00:02:36.120> had<00:02:36.239> mixed<00:02:36.599> rumors<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
although I've had mixed rumors and I

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.680 
although I've had mixed rumors and I
guess<00:02:38.129> they<00:02:38.310> are<00:02:38.459> rumors<00:02:38.849> I've<00:02:39.150> taken<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.629> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
guess they are rumors I've taken with a

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.300 
guess they are rumors I've taken with a
pinch<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.989> salt<00:02:40.170> there's<00:02:40.769> people<00:02:40.980> saying

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
pinch of salt there's people saying

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
pinch of salt there's people saying
there's<00:02:41.610> not<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> hardcore<00:02:42.629> mode

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
there's not going to be a hardcore mode

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.809 
there's not going to be a hardcore mode
there's<00:02:43.530> people<00:02:43.709> saying<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.640> don't

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
there's people saying there is I don't

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.479 
there's people saying there is I don't
really<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> guess<00:02:46.950> we'll<00:02:47.099> find<00:02:47.340> out

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
really know so I guess we'll find out

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.150 
really know so I guess we'll find out
when<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> games<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> shelf<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.160> if

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
when the games on the shelf and if

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.800 
when the games on the shelf and if
you're<00:02:50.340> an<00:02:50.459> early<00:02:50.670> subscriber<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.569> mine

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
you're an early subscriber of mine

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.539 
you're an early subscriber of mine
you'll<00:02:52.319> remember<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.920> used<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.280> put<00:02:53.430> up

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
you'll remember that I used to put up

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.690 
you'll remember that I used to put up
say<00:02:53.760> two<00:02:53.819> or<00:02:54.450> three<00:02:54.840> videos<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.319> week<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.950> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
say two or three videos a week and you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.699 
say two or three videos a week and you
may<00:02:56.849> have<00:02:56.940> noticed<00:02:57.359> that<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.930> don't<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.349> up<00:02:58.470> as

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
may have noticed that I don't put up as

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.210 
may have noticed that I don't put up as
many<00:02:59.099> grief<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.849> videos<00:03:00.180> as<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.690> used<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.159> and<00:03:02.159> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
many grief in videos as I used to and I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.670 
many grief in videos as I used to and I
think<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> reason<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.780> kind<00:03:04.620> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
think the reason for that is I kind of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.460 
think the reason for that is I kind of
want<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.890> focus<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.400> quality<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:06.569> also<00:03:06.750> with

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
want to focus on quality but also with

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.680 
want to focus on quality but also with
black<00:03:07.620> ops<00:03:07.920> I'm<00:03:08.250> finding<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.819> harder<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.269> find

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
black ops I'm finding it harder to find

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.170 
black ops I'm finding it harder to find
people<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.349> annoy<00:03:10.829> now<00:03:11.129> I<00:03:11.370> mean<00:03:11.909> there's<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.090> lot

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
people to annoy now I mean there's a lot

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.110 
people to annoy now I mean there's a lot
of<00:03:12.239> people<00:03:12.390> with<00:03:12.480> microphones<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:14.120> not

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
of people with microphones but not

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.210 
of people with microphones but not
everyone<00:03:15.450> reacts<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.409> think<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.920> get<00:03:17.129> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
everyone reacts and I think I get the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.409 
everyone reacts and I think I get the
feeling<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.609> people<00:03:17.760> getting<00:03:18.030> bored<00:03:18.209> of

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
feeling that people getting bored of

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.140 
feeling that people getting bored of
black<00:03:18.599> ops<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.650> coming<00:03:20.310> harder<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.940> get

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
black ops so it's coming harder to get

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
black ops so it's coming harder to get
the<00:03:21.239> footage<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:22.290> never<00:03:22.919> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> quit
