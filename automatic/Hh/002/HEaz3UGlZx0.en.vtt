update video my name is John and this is
the<00:00:09.750> alkaloid<00:00:10.320> desert<00:00:10.790> mixed<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.880> with

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
the alkaloid desert mixed in with

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.299 
the alkaloid desert mixed in with
probably<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.630> duel<00:00:12.929> arena<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.070> see

here is we brought it to life a lot this
was<00:00:22.920> mostly<00:00:23.279> Matt<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.699> will<00:00:24.029> admit<00:00:24.930> thank<00:00:25.619> you

was mostly Matt I will admit thank you
Matt<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.130> building<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.699> phenomenal<00:00:28.039> all

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
Matt for building it was phenomenal all

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.120 
Matt for building it was phenomenal all
of<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:30.349> barriers<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> canyon

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of these barriers here with the canyon

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
of these barriers here with the canyon
were<00:00:32.550> him<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> does<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> lot<00:00:33.870> more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
were him and it does make a lot more

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.160 
were him and it does make a lot more
sense<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.160> terms<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.610> actual

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
sense now still in terms of actual

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
sense now still in terms of actual
geography<00:00:37.399> weird<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.300> runescape<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
geography weird but for runescape is

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
geography weird but for runescape is
cool<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.950> yeah<00:00:41.129> there's<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> canyon<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
cool so yeah there's the canyon that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
cool so yeah there's the canyon that
basically<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.719> completely<00:00:43.379> cuts<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.950> off

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
basically just completely cuts you off

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.369 
basically just completely cuts you off
from<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> real<00:00:46.079> world

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
from what you would think the real world

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.709 
from what you would think the real world
when<00:00:46.980> you're<00:00:47.160> down<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.149> really<00:00:48.390> does

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
when you're down here it really does

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
when you're down here it really does
feel<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.620> forever<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
feel like you're in a forever kind of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.240 
feel like you're in a forever kind of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
zone it's really awesome especially with

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
zone it's really awesome especially with
longer<00:00:53.610> distance<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.379> sure<00:00:55.469> than

full feel for you bro now we've put

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
full feel for you bro now we've put
cactuses<00:00:59.730> around<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> give<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> some<00:01:00.480> life<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cactuses around to give it some life the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
cactuses around to give it some life the
dead<00:01:01.770> brushes<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.579> bushes<00:01:03.149> even<00:01:03.420> although

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
dead brushes and bushes even although

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
dead brushes and bushes even although
they're<00:01:04.260> dead<00:01:04.470> give<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> some<00:01:05.129> life<00:01:05.280> because

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
they're dead give it some life because

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080 
they're dead give it some life because
it<00:01:06.330> doesn't<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.810> flat<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> dull<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.490> hills

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it doesn't look flat and dull the hills

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
it doesn't look flat and dull the hills
have<00:01:09.330> been<00:01:09.479> completely<00:01:10.110> remade<00:01:10.590> again<00:01:10.979> as

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
have been completely remade again as

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
have been completely remade again as
normal<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.479> roll<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:13.369> towards<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
normal so that they roll up towards a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
normal so that they roll up towards a
certain<00:01:15.000> point<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:16.080> don't<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.530> go<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
certain point they don't just go up down

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.359 
certain point they don't just go up down
up<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.360> they're<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.930> blocked

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
up down and they're not just blocked

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
up down and they're not just blocked
what<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.490> did<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.080> areas<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.560> well

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
what we did is for other areas as well

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.830 
what we did is for other areas as well
is<00:01:23.040> we've<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.240> hand<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
is we've put them down by hand now that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
is we've put them down by hand now that
may<00:01:24.990> sound<00:01:25.200> silly<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.710> may<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.860> another<00:01:26.189> way

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
may sound silly there may be another way

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
may sound silly there may be another way
to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> can't<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> precision

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to do but you can't get the precision

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.880 
to do but you can't get the precision
that<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.710> wanted<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.689> any<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> program

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that we wanted with any kind of program

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
that we wanted with any kind of program
that<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.390> doubt<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> outside

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that we know of so we doubt the outside

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.819 
that we know of so we doubt the outside
we<00:01:34.560> use<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.420> voxel<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.720> make<00:01:36.930> bedrock

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
we use for a voxel to make bedrock

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
we use for a voxel to make bedrock
circles<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> shape<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.509> then

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
circles in the shape that we want then

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
circles in the shape that we want then
we<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.590> hand<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.820> stack<00:01:42.090> up

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
we go over them with hand or we stack up

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
we go over them with hand or we stack up
the<00:01:42.390> bedrock<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.380> mean<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.220> loads<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the bedrock and I mean there's loads of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
the bedrock and I mean there's loads of
ways<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.420> make<00:01:45.659> sure<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
ways to do and but we make sure that it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
ways to do and but we make sure that it
only<00:01:47.040> goes<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.729> five<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.240> six<00:01:48.390> blocks

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
only goes up by about five or six blocks

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350 
only goes up by about five or six blocks
it<00:01:48.930> goes<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.090> plays

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it goes down by one or two so it plays

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.590 
it goes down by one or two so it plays
well<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.140> flat<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.100> makes<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
well it's not flat and it just makes the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.709 
well it's not flat and it just makes the

all of the mind to do we've not focused

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
all of the mind to do we've not focused
on<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.729> we've<00:01:59.880> just<00:01:59.909> focused<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.600> pure

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

on that we've just focused on pure
aesthetics<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> corner<00:02:02.909> here<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> nice

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
aesthetics now in the corner here a nice

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
aesthetics now in the corner here a nice
little<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.990> water<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.640> little

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
little bit of water and the little

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
little bit of water and the little
Canyon<00:02:06.180> break<00:02:06.570> down<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.530> breaks<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.950> up

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
Canyon break down it just breaks it up

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
Canyon break down it just breaks it up
from<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.670> sand<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> look<00:02:09.780> into

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
from all of this sand if you look into

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.180 
from all of this sand if you look into
the<00:02:10.080> corner<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.979> instead<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the corner you can see that instead of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.430 
the corner you can see that instead of
Finn<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.490> mean<00:02:12.670> there's<00:02:13.450> no<00:02:13.570> point<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.080> but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
Finn I mean there's no point in it but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.110 
Finn I mean there's no point in it but
again<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.070> makes<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.580> look<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.880> lot<00:02:16.060> nicer

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
again it just makes you look a lot nicer

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.940 
again it just makes you look a lot nicer
from<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.810> distance<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.350> over<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.830> can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
from a distance like over here you can

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.040 
from a distance like over here you can
just<00:02:17.980> see<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.310> instead<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.210> just<00:02:19.420> sand<00:02:19.870> to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
just see that instead of just sand to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.030 
just see that instead of just sand to
the<00:02:20.170> end<00:02:20.320> it's<00:02:20.860> amazing<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.460> nice<00:02:22.420> fire

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the end it's amazing a nice fire

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.500 
the end it's amazing a nice fire

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
talisman here we are going to change the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.730 
talisman here we are going to change the
ones<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:25.870> varrock<00:02:26.200> there<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> earth

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
ones in varrock there the earth

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.100

talismans and stuff with the things on

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.860 
talismans and stuff with the things on
top<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.500> them<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:31.360> be<00:02:31.480> honest<00:02:31.720> they're

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
top of them because to be honest they're

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.440 
top of them because to be honest they're
quite<00:02:32.050> pointless<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:33.190> don't<00:02:33.910> really<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.120> them

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
quite pointless I don't really like them

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.540 
quite pointless I don't really like them
anymore<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.040> breaks<00:02:36.400> you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
anymore and it kind of just breaks you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.220 
anymore and it kind of just breaks you
up<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.880> when<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.150> look<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.570> you'll<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:38.050> see

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
up so when you look in you'll just see

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.080 
up so when you look in you'll just see
that<00:02:38.410> above<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.860> instead<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> area<00:02:39.970> behind

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that above it instead of the area behind

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.380 
that above it instead of the area behind
not<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> coolest<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.680> ideas<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.160> again<00:02:43.060> here

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
not the coolest of ideas and again here

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.200 
not the coolest of ideas and again here
this<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:44.430> what<00:02:45.430> they've<00:02:45.550> done<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.060> new

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
this is what they've done to the new

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.880 
this is what they've done to the new
jewel<00:02:46.420> arena<00:02:46.720> obviously<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.710> have

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
jewel arena obviously we have

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.760 
jewel arena obviously we have
incorporated<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:50.320> take<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
incorporated this because we take the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.600 
incorporated this because we take the
good<00:02:50.950> ideas<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:52.450> goes<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:52.990> way<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
good ideas it goes all the way up to the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.700 
good ideas it goes all the way up to the
duel<00:02:55.030> arena<00:02:55.240> instead<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.350> being<00:02:56.380> just

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
duel arena instead of it being just

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.800 
duel arena instead of it being just

can't get past it looks awesome and also
you<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.330> run<00:03:10.540> round<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.850> then<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.000> can

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you can run round here and then you can

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.270 
you can run round here and then you can
go<00:03:13.240> over<00:03:13.270> there<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.770> over<00:03:15.040> here

go over there and this bit over here

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.640 
go over there and this bit over here
would<00:03:15.460> be<00:03:15.640> where<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.970> mages<00:03:16.239> guild<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:17.500> or

this<00:03:41.890> from<00:03:42.630> doing<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.690> load<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.930> detail<00:03:44.350> in

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
this from doing a load of detail in

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.670 
this from doing a load of detail in
while<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:45.640> was<00:03:45.760> asleep<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.600> yeah<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
while I was asleep so yeah and this is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.979 
while I was asleep so yeah and this is
the<00:03:47.920> entrance<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.940> duel<00:03:49.510> arena<00:03:49.660> which<00:03:49.870> is

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
the entrance to the duel arena which is

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.110 
the entrance to the duel arena which is
a<00:03:50.019> lot<00:03:50.440> nicer<00:03:50.470> than<00:03:50.830> what<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.070> used<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.459> it's

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
a lot nicer than what it used to be it's

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.940 
a lot nicer than what it used to be it's
got<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.360> walking<00:03:52.989> path<00:03:53.200> towards<00:03:53.739> its<00:03:53.860> you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
got the walking path towards its you

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.130 
got the walking path towards its you
just<00:03:54.190> see<00:03:54.430> where<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.269> that<00:03:55.540> works<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.870> lot

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
just see where is and that works a lot

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.870 
just see where is and that works a lot
nicer<00:03:56.380> especially<00:03:57.040> with<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.340> updated

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
nicer especially with the updated

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.300 
nicer especially with the updated
updated<00:03:58.330> updated<00:03:58.959> alkyd<00:03:59.470> with<00:03:59.500> much<00:04:00.100> more

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
updated updated alkyd with much more

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.690 
updated updated alkyd with much more
detail<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:02.470> basically<00:04:02.680> looks<00:04:03.280> like<00:04:03.580> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
detail and it basically looks like the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.640 
detail and it basically looks like the
most<00:04:03.850> expensive<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.750> richest<00:04:05.170> place<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
most expensive and richest place in the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.240 
most expensive and richest place in the
on<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:05.980> planet<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> those<00:04:08.680> are<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.830> change<00:04:09.070> to

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
on the planet so those are the change to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.550 
on the planet so those are the change to
the<00:04:09.340> desert<00:04:09.790> I'm<00:04:09.970> really<00:04:10.900> happy<00:04:11.080> about<00:04:11.290> what

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
the desert I'm really happy about what

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.990 
the desert I'm really happy about what
the<00:04:11.650> desert<00:04:11.980> turned<00:04:12.190> out<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.519> be<00:04:12.670> because<00:04:12.910> it

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
the desert turned out to be because it

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.360 
the desert turned out to be because it
is<00:04:13.150> at<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> end<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> day<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.230> sand<00:04:14.590> so

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
is at the end of the day just sand so

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.729 
is at the end of the day just sand so

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
desert now there's still a bit of canyon

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.430 
desert now there's still a bit of canyon
because<00:04:35.080> at<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.440> time<00:04:35.470> we<00:04:36.010> were<00:04:37.260> doing<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.350> on

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
because at the time we were doing it on

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.810 
because at the time we were doing it on
this<00:04:38.620> one<00:04:38.860> then<00:04:38.980> we<00:04:39.100> were<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.310> hold<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.640> we'll

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
this one then we were like hold on we'll

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.130 
this one then we were like hold on we'll
just<00:04:39.970> make<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.090> new<00:04:40.300> world<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.780> make<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.020> look

as well you can really see the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.700 
as well you can really see the
difference<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:45.280> old<00:04:45.520> Jew<00:04:45.850> no<00:04:46.030> jewelry<00:04:46.570> no<00:04:46.710> my

difference the old Jew no jewelry no my
god<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.460> looks<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:48.850> bad<00:04:49.540> it's<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:50.350> flat<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:51.040> just

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
god it looks so bad it's so flat it just

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.740 
god it looks so bad it's so flat it just
looks<00:04:52.150> old<00:04:53.730> it's<00:04:54.730> not<00:04:54.970> as<00:04:55.120> good<00:04:55.300> as<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.510> new

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
looks old it's not as good as the new

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.080 
looks old it's not as good as the new
one<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:55.990> my<00:04:56.110> opinion<00:04:56.380> anyway<00:04:56.760> you<00:04:57.760> can<00:04:57.910> see<00:04:58.060> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
one in my opinion anyway you can see a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.060 
one in my opinion anyway you can see a
massive<00:04:58.720> amount<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.080> change<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.800> ground

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
massive amount of change in the ground

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.950 
massive amount of change in the ground
now<00:05:00.610> again<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.360> what<00:05:01.480> I'm<00:05:01.570> talking<00:05:01.630> about

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
now again this is what I'm talking about

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960 
now again this is what I'm talking about
with<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.290> hills<00:05:02.500> which<00:05:03.310> one<00:05:03.550> was<00:05:03.670> put<00:05:03.880> in

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
with the hills which one was put in

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.630 
with the hills which one was put in
first<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.510> path<00:05:05.500> or<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.890> hills<00:05:06.190> you're<00:05:06.490> right

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
first the path or the hills you're right

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.700 
first the path or the hills you're right
it's<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.880> path<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:07.540> tell<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.080> because

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
it's the path you can tell that because

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.890 
it's the path you can tell that because
we've<00:05:09.010> not<00:05:09.220> tried<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.730> lift<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.180> or<00:05:10.360> lower<00:05:10.660> it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
we've not tried to lift it or lower it

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.510 
we've not tried to lift it or lower it
in<00:05:11.020> any<00:05:11.230> way<00:05:11.380> we<00:05:11.680> just<00:05:11.890> started<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.310> hills

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
in any way we just started the hills

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.420 
in any way we just started the hills
from<00:05:13.120> as<00:05:14.110> close<00:05:14.500> as<00:05:14.710> possible<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.310> just

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
from as close as possible and it just

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.890 
from as close as possible and it just
goes<00:05:15.550> straight<00:05:15.700> up<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.150> can<00:05:16.300> tell<00:05:16.480> where<00:05:16.750> it

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
goes straight up you can tell where it

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.980 
goes straight up you can tell where it
starts<00:05:17.260> all<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.470> time<00:05:17.830> here<00:05:18.220> there<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.240> they

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
starts all the time here there and they

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.170 
starts all the time here there and they
just<00:05:20.200> really<00:05:20.680> really<00:05:21.040> really<00:05:21.460> badly<00:05:21.850> made

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
just really really really badly made

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.360 
just really really really badly made
there's<00:05:22.360> no<00:05:22.480> flowing<00:05:23.050> in<00:05:23.200> them<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.980> just<00:05:24.220> looks

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
there's no flowing in them it just looks

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.340 
there's no flowing in them it just looks
like<00:05:24.490> normal<00:05:24.910> generation<00:05:25.510> now<00:05:25.870> again<00:05:26.170> this

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
like normal generation now again this

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.050 
like normal generation now again this
bit<00:05:26.560> here<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.980> just<00:05:27.160> where<00:05:27.370> Matt<00:05:27.610> copied<00:05:27.970> and

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
bit here is just where Matt copied and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.770 
bit here is just where Matt copied and
pasted<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:29.880> cactus<00:05:30.880> finger<00:05:31.180> over<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.480> canyon

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
pasted the cactus finger over the canyon

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.080 
pasted the cactus finger over the canyon
so<00:05:32.050> that's<00:05:32.260> not<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.440> problem<00:05:32.650> but<00:05:33.220> look<00:05:33.820> here

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
so that's not a problem but look here

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.140 
so that's not a problem but look here
like<00:05:34.300> it's<00:05:34.660> just<00:05:34.840> fin<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:36.520> goes<00:05:36.700> up<00:05:36.910> for<00:05:37.090> no

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
like it's just fin it goes up for no

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.510 
like it's just fin it goes up for no
reason<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:37.870> back<00:05:38.050> down<00:05:38.290> you<00:05:38.920> can't<00:05:39.220> see

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
reason and it's back down you can't see

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.490 
reason and it's back down you can't see
where<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:39.790> go<00:05:39.970> in<00:05:40.120> much<00:05:40.300> because<00:05:40.810> everything

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
where you go in much because everything

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.010 
where you go in much because everything
is<00:05:41.590> just<00:05:41.800> even<00:05:42.370> though<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:43.210> doesn't<00:05:43.390> even

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
is just even though it doesn't even

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.200 
is just even though it doesn't even
though<00:05:44.170> it's<00:05:44.290> not<00:05:44.380> flat<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:44.950> looks<00:05:45.340> flat<00:05:45.970> in<00:05:46.150> a

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
though it's not flat it looks flat in a

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.230 
though it's not flat it looks flat in a
bad<00:05:46.450> way<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:47.320> in<00:05:47.530> my<00:05:47.710> opinion<00:05:47.800> anyway<00:05:48.130> you<00:05:49.030> guys

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
bad way so in my opinion anyway you guys

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.460 
bad way so in my opinion anyway you guys
may<00:05:49.450> have<00:05:49.540> a<00:05:49.600> different<00:05:49.780> opinion<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:50.320> looks

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
may have a different opinion it looks

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.470 
may have a different opinion it looks
fine<00:05:50.650> but<00:05:50.890> in<00:05:51.220> terms<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.700> what<00:05:52.060> we<00:05:52.180> were<00:05:52.210> going

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
fine but in terms of what we were going

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.110 
fine but in terms of what we were going
for<00:05:52.600> it<00:05:53.020> just<00:05:53.260> doesn't<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.740> spent<00:05:54.400> ages<00:05:54.610> doing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
for it just doesn't I spent ages doing

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.910 
for it just doesn't I spent ages doing
that<00:05:55.300> for<00:05:55.540> no<00:05:55.630> reason<00:05:55.990> I<00:05:56.110> was<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.350> point<00:05:56.650> look<00:05:56.800> it

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
that for no reason I was a point look it

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.950 
that for no reason I was a point look it
looks<00:05:57.070> awful<00:05:57.660> really<00:05:58.660> should<00:05:58.840> waste<00:05:59.020> my<00:05:59.230> time

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
looks awful really should waste my time

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.020 
looks awful really should waste my time
that's<00:06:01.960> bad<00:06:02.140> and<00:06:02.830> then<00:06:02.980> also<00:06:03.160> because<00:06:03.850> we

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
that's bad and then also because we

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.610 
that's bad and then also because we
didn't<00:06:04.300> have<00:06:04.330> any<00:06:04.510> ideas<00:06:04.930> for<00:06:04.990> stuff<00:06:05.350> because

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
didn't have any ideas for stuff because

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.220 
didn't have any ideas for stuff because
it<00:06:05.680> was<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:05.890> bland<00:06:06.220> in<00:06:06.400> color<00:06:06.460> we<00:06:07.390> just<00:06:07.630> put<00:06:07.810> am
