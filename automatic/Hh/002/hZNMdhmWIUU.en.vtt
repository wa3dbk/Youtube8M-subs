00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
here's a few things we've noticed from

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.780 
here's a few things we've noticed from
what<00:00:01.770> in<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:01.949> world<00:00:02.100> cup<00:00:02.310> over<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.639> last

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
what in the world cup over the last

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.519 
what in the world cup over the last
couple<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.149> days<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.629> think<00:00:04.110> Scotland

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
couple of days that I think Scotland

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.769 
couple of days that I think Scotland
could<00:00:04.950> have<00:00:05.040> beaten<00:00:05.310> Morocco<00:00:05.730> if<00:00:06.270> only<00:00:06.569> they'd

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
could have beaten Morocco if only they'd

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.330 
could have beaten Morocco if only they'd
tip<00:00:07.049> their<00:00:07.319> heads<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.830> bench<00:00:13.130> maybe<00:00:14.130> one

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
tip their heads on the bench maybe one

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.890 
tip their heads on the bench maybe one
of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> reasons<00:00:14.519> why<00:00:14.910> Spain<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.630> gone<00:00:15.780> out

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of the reasons why Spain have gone out

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.630 
of the reasons why Spain have gone out
of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> world<00:00:16.230> cup<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.710> their<00:00:17.130> tendency<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of the world cup is their tendency to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
of the world cup is their tendency to
reveal<00:00:18.150> their<00:00:18.420> formation<00:00:19.020> before<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
reveal their formation before the
