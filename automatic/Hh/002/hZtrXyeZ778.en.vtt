00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.690
 hello hello today I bring you this look is a 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.510
 normal smoker but you have 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.059
 written request many times that 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.369
 did the smoking so today finally 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.600
 I record it and here I bring it to you I hope that 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.600
 enjoy and enjoy the video 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.710
 to begin with I am going to put this base of 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 makeup that is matte mineral mate 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 of gullón mousse mythology of 86 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.719
 with a brush of with the bristles so very 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.410
 long and loose I will apply the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.410
 corrector 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 I'm going to use the long lasting of kiko 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 in tone 4 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.700
 I'm going to use this slip paddle 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 to little touches I'm going to apply 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 matte black on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.300
 with a brush to blur clean I'll 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 catch the chocolate brown tone that comes 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.570
 and I'm going to blur all the above 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.570
 black 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.550
 Now let's take the colored clarito 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.319
 with a brush to blur to clean and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.319
 let's light the arch of the eyebrows 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.310
 eliminating the cut with the brown shadow 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.420
 now I'm going to take the color black tatum 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.790
 and put together what is the whole part below 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.610
 of the eyelashes 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.770
 I know that delineating the coming to the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 lacrimal is to say completing the line 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.090
 when done, I'm going to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.780
 delineate the top part with a 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.880
 soft eyeliner and making a roller 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.580
 that ends in peak 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.330
 we can not forget to delineate the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.330
 water on line 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.930
 Well I have just given me realize that 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.880
 while I finished, I had not 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.280
 finished the battery and was not recording 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.760
 so I'm going to show you what I've 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.370
 put and so it's exactly the same 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.320
 I have used this blush woods 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.320
 is the tone 05 sand 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.030
 Then I used the illuminator 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 georges of the heron and I have used it in 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.630
 this zone 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.640
 in the central area and here a little dot 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.080
 and on the lips I used this lip 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.140
 of the wonderwoman collection that is the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.240
 sea ​​cyst 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.220
 and I'm going to show you the tone because as 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.520
 It is limited edition but well so 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.010
 you can see is a level 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.530
 candy color with some touch like that 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.360
 golden and remains as you see it in the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.430
 I hope you liked the lips 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.680
 video that's how I usually do 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.540
 the smoked I know there are many 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.700
 smoked tutorials already by the network of 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.560
 good as I have received many 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.150
 petitions telling me to make a 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.930
 smoked video at the end I say 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:31.170
 good total is a basic like who says 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.550
 in the channel so I'm going to do it and that 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.470
 nothing that I hope you liked and 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.290
 that above all be useful we see ourselves in the 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.140
