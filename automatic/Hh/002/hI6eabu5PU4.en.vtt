00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.060
 hello my name is daniela 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 it comes completely on the content 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.660
 now first in this question and indeed 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.850
 the next user really asks one 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.190
 interesting question and that is daniel 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
 you can just be effective 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.570
 imagine training exercises and yes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.239
 I'll do that orally and I will 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.830
 I'm close to sewing is just mine 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.230
 to film training and then all 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.920
 over loudspeakers so far too 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.180
 but first of all comment 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.030
 a training I really do from 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.700
 effective attitude may indeed be fundamental 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.530
 I tell you to go away from cable trains 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.160
 goes away from appliances 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.149
 I think a lot about it 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.520
 degrees of freedom, therefore, accordingly 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.170
 all freedom to exercise 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 and you can just achieve that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.640
 by acting about course or 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.670
 free trade and then specially, of course 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.850
 the whole reason about so always 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.100
 Complex complex exercise is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.289
 it was bank presses to pull it off 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.899
 squat or be it cross that are 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.000
 really so special and really 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.580
 also very good effective exercises 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.920
 why the whole because you have there 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.549
 simply the higher shares of many 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.500
 more complex creative processes that 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.659
 is called at bank press for example 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.580
 so there was another in the triceps 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.950
 as well as the pact oral share the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.290
 vote on both the wrist 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.659
 musculature the fine-tuning how 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.030
 further component the qualitative 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.579
 component symmetrical left and right 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.150
 move concentrically and eccentrically 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.220
 must, of course, is much higher 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.860
 more effective grace or mood of course 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.530
 old just by the muscle 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.430
 train in isolation and that's why I am 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.709
 quite clearly for that of the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.470
 stationary devices and more about the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.270
 First of all I want to have a free league as well 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.099
 still 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.860
 So first I have the hand of the hand 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.920
 basic exercise and, of course, continue 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.720
 as it is for example in trapezoid 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 always nice shoulder pull one too 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.319
 very effective exercise then continue over 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 the over the triceps is triceps back 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.150
 over head bicep curls isolated 45 degrees 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.730
 of course, the whole thing is also down 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.830
 very very effective exercise in that 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.780
 Of course he keeps the muscle in again and again 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.450
 movement and of course then into the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.600
 concentric phase so the follower 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.700
 So the full range of movement had 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.540
 Of course there if you always exactly 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.360
 So, first of all, the first one works 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.090
 called exercise and is definitely waiting 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 on the training video was then in 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.090
 the next few weeks in the next 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.799
 days depending on the time 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.360
 Of course, the whole thing will comment 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.920
 in that sense, when I do the whole thing 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.769
 like you give me in any case 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.769
 a village high and remains net
