with you this is not one of those

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.110 
with you this is not one of those
melodies<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.339> could<00:00:05.549> play<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.819> you

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
melodies that I could play to you

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.200 
melodies that I could play to you
starting<00:00:06.839> from<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.140> 15th<00:00:07.529> note<00:00:07.859> really<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.000> can

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
starting from the 15th note really I can

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.450 
starting from the 15th note really I can
only<00:00:09.330> play<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.750> from<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> first<00:00:10.260> note

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
only play it from the first note

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.370 
only play it from the first note
so<00:00:13.180> what<00:00:13.420> follows<00:00:13.600> is<00:00:13.990> going<00:00:14.230> to<00:00:14.290> be

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
so what follows is going to be

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.620 
so what follows is going to be
entertaining<00:00:14.860> to<00:00:15.040> say<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.460> least<00:00:15.640> but<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.450> can

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
entertaining to say the least but I can

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.350 
entertaining to say the least but I can
show<00:00:16.810> you<00:00:16.870> the<00:00:17.110> rough<00:00:17.320> idea<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.880> it<00:00:22.029> starts

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
show you the rough idea so it starts

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.120 
show you the rough idea so it starts
with<00:00:22.420> that<00:00:22.540> kind<00:00:22.990> of<00:00:23.050> idea<00:00:23.200> with<00:00:23.560> two<00:00:23.740> hands<00:00:24.040> of

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
with that kind of idea with two hands of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.609 
with that kind of idea with two hands of
mirroring<00:00:24.610> each<00:00:24.700> other<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.260> each<00:00:26.260> pair<00:00:26.560> of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
mirroring each other and each pair of

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.150 
mirroring each other and each pair of
notes<00:00:26.980> this<00:00:27.670> hand<00:00:27.939> is<00:00:28.090> leading<00:00:28.620> so<00:00:29.620> if<00:00:29.860> we<00:00:30.010> look

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
notes this hand is leading so if we look

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.330 
notes this hand is leading so if we look
at<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.370> tapping<00:00:30.760> lick<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.890> will<00:00:33.010> be<00:00:33.100> easy<00:00:33.220> to

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
at the tapping lick it will be easy to

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.090 
at the tapping lick it will be easy to
lose<00:00:33.520> track<00:00:33.879> of<00:00:33.910> this<00:00:34.270> but<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> try<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.680> bear<00:00:35.980> in

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
lose track of this but a try to bear in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.410 
lose track of this but a try to bear in
mind<00:00:36.129> that<00:00:36.430> you<00:00:36.699> should<00:00:36.940> be<00:00:37.030> able<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.239> squeeze

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
mind that you should be able to squeeze

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.960 
mind that you should be able to squeeze
six<00:00:37.900> of<00:00:38.110> these<00:00:38.290> notes<00:00:38.559> into<00:00:39.100> each<00:00:39.489> beat<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:39.940> you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
six of these notes into each beat so you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.280 
six of these notes into each beat so you
get<00:00:40.180> back<00:00:40.390> into<00:00:40.540> Digger<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.930> take<00:00:41.080> it<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:41.260> that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
get back into Digger to take it to that

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.450 
get back into Digger to take it to that
I<00:00:41.470> don't<00:00:41.710> thinking<00:00:41.920> that<00:00:42.010> they<00:00:42.100> can't<00:00:42.280> attack

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
I don't thinking that they can't attack

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.729 
I don't thinking that they can't attack
at<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.670> thick<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.989> let's<00:00:44.170> try<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.470> play<00:00:44.590> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
at the thick so let's try and play the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.250 
at the thick so let's try and play the
first<00:00:44.980> bit<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.700> is<00:00:45.910> two<00:00:46.090> hands<00:00:46.480> mirroring

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
first bit this is two hands mirroring

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
first bit this is two hands mirroring
each<00:00:47.470> other<00:00:47.770> so<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:51.340> kind<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.700> shape<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.300> as

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
each other so that kind of shape and as

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.060 
each other so that kind of shape and as
ever<00:00:55.210> I'm<00:00:55.480> wasting<00:00:56.020> one<00:00:56.140> of<00:00:56.260> my<00:00:56.380> best<00:00:56.620> fingers

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
ever I'm wasting one of my best fingers

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.229 
ever I'm wasting one of my best fingers
by<00:00:57.219> using<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:57.880> store<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.480> pic<00:00:58.719> and<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:01.059> you

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
by using it to store the pic and if you

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.240 
by using it to store the pic and if you
have<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> better<00:01:01.630> idea<00:01:01.780> go<00:01:02.380> for<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:02.950> for<00:01:03.130> me

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
have a better idea go for it but for me

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
have a better idea go for it but for me
it's<00:01:03.489> mostly<00:01:04.000> these<00:01:04.270> fingers<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:08.369> then

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.770 

that's<00:01:14.229> an<00:01:14.500> odd<00:01:14.649> bit<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.790> lot<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.630> it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
that's an odd bit because a lot of it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420 
that's an odd bit because a lot of it
looks<00:01:19.990> like<00:01:20.140> fourth<00:01:20.590> intervals<00:01:21.040> or<00:01:21.190> something

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
looks like fourth intervals or something

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.980 
looks like fourth intervals or something
close<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.640> fourth<00:01:22.030> interval<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:22.630> I'm<00:01:22.750> having

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
close to fourth interval so I'm having

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.760 
close to fourth interval so I'm having
to<00:01:23.140> climb<00:01:23.970> towards<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.060> lower<00:01:25.210> strings<00:01:25.770> using

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
to climb towards the lower strings using

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.130 
to climb towards the lower strings using
the<00:01:26.890> same<00:01:27.159> pair<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.520> fingers<00:01:27.909> for<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.090> lot<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.240> it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
the same pair of fingers for a lot of it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
the same pair of fingers for a lot of it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.660

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
and then so more stacked fourth kind of

and then so more stacked fourth kind of
ideas<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:58.870> might<00:01:59.870> like<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.050> on<00:02:00.320> its<00:02:00.500> own

ideas you might like that on its own

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.180 
ideas you might like that on its own
it's<00:02:00.890> quite<00:02:01.100> intervallic<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.270> amusing

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190

change string at the wrong time but

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
sound as huge as I can and what seems to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.009 
sound as huge as I can and what seems to
work<00:03:34.640> with<00:03:34.790> my<00:03:34.940> hand<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.510> if<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.840> use<00:03:35.989> two

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
work with my hand is if I use two

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.860 
work with my hand is if I use two
fingers<00:03:36.680> at<00:03:36.950> any<00:03:37.069> given<00:03:37.310> time<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.720> two

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
fingers at any given time and the two

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
pairings which keep cropping up are the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.059 
pairings which keep cropping up are the
middle<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.810> ring<00:03:41.930> fingers<00:03:42.290> together<00:03:42.620> or<00:03:42.890> the

middle and little fingers together and

middle and little fingers together and
those<00:03:45.290> two<00:03:45.530> pairs<00:03:45.739> seem<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.190> work<00:03:46.370> really<00:03:46.400> well

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
those two pairs seem to work really well

together will never be as good I will
try<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:52.880> avoid<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.209> pair<00:03:54.010> because<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> don't

think anyone's going to give me an award

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.180

for<00:03:56.720> trying<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.109> fret<00:03:57.410> two<00:03:57.590> notes<00:03:57.799> with<00:03:58.040> those

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
for trying to fret two notes with those

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.520 
for trying to fret two notes with those
fingers<00:03:58.609> if<00:03:58.850> there's<00:03:59.239> a<00:03:59.299> way<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.569> rearrange

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
fingers if there's a way to rearrange

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.379 
fingers if there's a way to rearrange
everything<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.400> use<00:04:01.609> those<00:04:01.910> two<00:04:02.180> or

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
everything so I can use those two or

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.110 
everything so I can use those two or
these<00:04:02.569> two<00:04:03.099> generally<00:04:04.099> I<00:04:04.340> can<00:04:04.549> make<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:04.970> leg

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
these two generally I can make the leg

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.970 
these two generally I can make the leg
sound<00:04:05.389> good<00:04:05.569> with<00:04:05.720> less<00:04:05.989> gain<00:04:06.290> on<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.590> amp<00:04:06.739> I

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
sound good with less gain on the amp I

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.379 
sound good with less gain on the amp I
can<00:04:07.130> get<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.280> bigger<00:04:07.489> sounding<00:04:07.940> note<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
can get a bigger sounding note and

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.430 
can get a bigger sounding note and
everyone's<00:04:09.170> happier<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:12.019> definitely

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
everyone's happier and it's definitely

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.809 
everyone's happier and it's definitely
important<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:12.859> try<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.099> get<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.310> much<00:04:13.459> force

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
important to try and get as much force

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.339 
important to try and get as much force
as<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.389> into<00:04:16.900> each<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.169> those

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
as you can into each one of those

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.990 
as you can into each one of those
fingers<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:18.979> get<00:04:19.549> them<00:04:19.669> feeling<00:04:19.910> as

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
fingers and get them feeling as

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.750 
fingers and get them feeling as
independent<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:20.690> possible
