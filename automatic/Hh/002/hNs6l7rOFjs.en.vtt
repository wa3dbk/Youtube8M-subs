00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.050
 firm with a silver border and 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.910

 Always use your foot as a wall bracket 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.610

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.070
 he also has ambilight spectra 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.380
 2 and he honors the project on both sides 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.449
 off the tv and glow on the wall 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 the television is 3 centimeters thick such that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.810
 that hangs nicely on the wall 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 and as you see here on the side and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 also on the other side of the screen 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.159
 so sees the ambilight 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.869
 all connections and via the 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.060
 headphone connection the common 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.649
 interface so that you can use a module and module 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.240
 smart card digital television is possible 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.049
 without having to use 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.639
 from a digital decoder he has 3 usb 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.229
 you put connections here 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.789
 for example a USB stick in this case 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.439
 in and so you can immediately 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.469
 movies or photos on the big screen 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.569
 view he has no less than five hdmi 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.859
 connections for a blu-ray player 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.600
 for instance 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.819
 and they all have audio 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.880
 return channel so that is nice too 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.189
 here is the audio vga dvi in the die 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.229
 also an optical connection all 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.119
 component connections 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.889
 so this is the network connection here 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.600
 the television is also provided with a 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.609
 wireless adapter 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.109
 so you also just yes wireless 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.119
 can receive internet 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.880
 it a satellite and antenna connection 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.310
 scart connection a vga connection 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.810
 so for example you can on your computer 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.990
 and can use it as 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.099
 monitor screen and here are all the points 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.750
 for wall mounting 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.780
 but like I said you can just as well 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.980
 the sauce is always ahead 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 wall mount we have the tv now 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 connected to a blu-ray via HDMI and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.980
 I can tell you that the television and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 is edge led television and that means 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
 so that there are LED lights on the side of it 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.620
 sit on the screen and reflectors on the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.989
 back so that for an even 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.940
 breakdown worry it's a full 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.920
 HD television with a perfect pixel HD 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.239
 engine making it a whopping 4 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.410
 trillion different colors can 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.030
 view 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.840
 and he has an 800 hertz perfect 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.190
 motion rate 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.260
 allowing fast moving images 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
 for example in action scenes nice and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 sharply displayed 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.489
 The television is a 3D TV and view 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
 so movies with much more depth actually 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.550
 you can do any program with much more 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 view depth because it is a 2d 3d 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.290
 has concerts after you must of course 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.720
 for watching 3D movies and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.850
 active 3D goggles 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.930
 he also uses dual gaming and 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.910
 for example, you play one 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.930
 computer game with a friend 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.120
 then you no longer have to use it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.989
 of split screen but you can therefore 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.540
 fullscreen 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 driving your own racing car, for example 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.989
