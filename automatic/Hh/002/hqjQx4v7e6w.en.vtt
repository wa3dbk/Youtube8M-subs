00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.779
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 welcome to 5 x 1 answer let's go to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.809
 continue answering more questions than 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.190
 to leave you can leave us in the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 comments of each one today Luis 8 us 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 ask where will it arrive for the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 iphone 5 and ipad mini since we are 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.350
 we can say for what equipment is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.779
 Compatible dais as if specifically 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.260
 for your question for the ipad the iphone 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.240
 5 and the iPad mini if they are compatible 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 fact is one of the maxims of the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 greater improvements that we know the system 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.239
 operative that are old devices 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.239
 and for which it seems that they 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 the iphone 4s if they are all of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 Same equipment that is compatible with 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 he is eight canvases with them 9 is to say 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 from the iphone 4s onwards from the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 ipad mini 1 onwards from ipad's 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.110
 fourth from ipad 2 onwards 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 and the whole range of pleasure also by 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.339
 Of course filly fifth overall 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.520
 generation so good news for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.950
 we all hope it goes better than the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.130
 summary of the event we did of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 wwdc at 18 minutes on board all the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.160
 world saw it but if you are is maybe a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.229
 of the great subjects to tell us to 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.910
 respect that is still supported by 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.500
 the same equipment that I already mounted in 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 air about big apart from me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.410
 it seems that like to consume enough 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.540
 less battery will occupy much less 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.000
 then it seems that performance can 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 be frankly good 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 we will see we will take here we will be 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 to tell it and nothing to ask us questions 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.740
 and comments your opinion what 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.930
 you want because you know we'll read it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.729
 we put aside this is all see you 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 in another little while with more questions 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 here in apple 5 x 1 and the 5 for now 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.580
 answer because you already know what you are and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.000
 fernando from the time and we promise 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.000
 do what
