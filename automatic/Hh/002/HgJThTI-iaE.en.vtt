 further through 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.860
 the seven-time Formula 1 world champion has a clear message, especially for the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.080
 younger alcohol consumers 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 in Soweto 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.070

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.760
 go 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.410

 in times of alcopops and flatrate parties, the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.890
 Alcohol abuse among teens steadily 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.479
 Experts therefore criticize that the superficial concern for alcoholized 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.060
 Car driver basically just the image of Burkhard i should polish up and one 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.040
 completely different purpose 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.650
 In the Indian sense, you can of course percent 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.780
 Do not distract from such campaigns the percent parka 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.330
 Manufacturer 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.870
 Algol produces Alcohol wants to sell the advertising will ultimately 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.160
 applies 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.750
 with these indirect in the beach Hani entry Dakar the not alone there 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.800
 numerous producers try to present themselves as responsible 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 although they produce exactly what is in the criticism 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.310
 Nuclear power plants suddenly protect the climate, and motorists too 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.219
 pure environmental conscience suggested if they had a new car with very little

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.580
 sold 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.300
 in the end it depends again on end consumers of such 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.529
 Advertisements not to be mislead 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.269
 Products should be advertised that should be in every respect in the criticism 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.809
 Why is the consumer asking why? 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.909
 because with this producer now sell that product 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.129
 does not represent a problem, so to speak 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.590
 After all, the discussion about such advertising is an important topic 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.289
 once again in the foreground 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.759
