00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.739
 Automatically translated by the machine. Good morning! 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.739
 Today, I will tell you how my hair is on a basic footstool. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.909
 This is the style I do most often. Brush your hair. 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.929
 The coal mine was a bit dirty, so I added a little scented talcum powder. 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.879
 This style of my style is by no means the best, only in this way, can achieve this style, but 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.780
 It is what works best for me. a small part of the hair from above 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 Your ears and move the top of your head to the top. 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:01:00.369
 The way it is clipped out is too side. For this version you will need a mouse "basically 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.449
 This is the same, you want your hair to be wet. 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 I am a turban wrapped around the hair extension. Behind the pin head 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.119
 The way your hair is partially cut off. So you can see that I am using a darker color 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.569
 What am I doing. On the front, back and sides, so the pins 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.819
 It is a truly safe place. Now open the front of the phone and brush 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 It is. It is divided into three parts: left, center, and right. 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.899
 Let the left and right parts go, so you just hold the middle. 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.959
 The combing brush section straightens forward and makes the back of it, so it will 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.030
 Better shape. Lay it at the base in the rat and pin. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.090
 Sprayed the hair gel and smoothed it down. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 Use your fingers to make it fan-shaped so that it covers as many rats as possible. 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.519
 From the right part, it brushes up. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Comb back with a comb to pick it up and over to the opposite side. 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.030
 Needle, on the basis of the rat, the curve of the needle remains at the top of the rat, so 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.030
 In place. Repeat on the other side. 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.590
 Pull out the section, tease through the brush, the top and bottom of the needle, spray and smooth. 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.489
 If your unhappy shape just crush it until you like it, spray it again. 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 The fused bottom hair is a bit bumpy and just grabs a part from the side, funny 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.190
 The foot is behind. Of course, spray it in place. 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.650
 Repeat on the other side, you can almost do it. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 This is the basic bumpy almost complete. From the back you can see that there are several 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 Rats can still see the gap. Just fan out hair with fingers 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:25.289
 Cover them and spray. If you use the same color as your hair 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.660
 It doesn't matter as much. Time curls the rest of it. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 I am using a mini hair straightener curl. Don't forget that the position is too behind. 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.710
 Add some accessories to the front and back and you're done! 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.720
 I like to use long ribbons at the back, so it looks even more impressive. 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.740
 If you think your hair is not big enough, you can comb some extra volume THR roots. 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:25.759
 The motto of my life, there is no such thing as too much hair gel. 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.780
 So now you have done what you just need and show it all. 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.810
