ridiculous stuff they brought back and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
ridiculous stuff they brought back and
then<00:01:15.030> worked<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> guys<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> team<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
then worked with the guys on the team to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.890 
then worked with the guys on the team to
put<00:01:17.580> together<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> encounters<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> test

put together the encounters and test

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
put together the encounters and test
them<00:01:19.110> most<00:01:19.830> recently<00:01:20.159> I've<00:01:20.340> been<00:01:20.430> working

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
them most recently I've been working

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
them most recently I've been working
with<00:01:20.759> beta<00:01:21.060> players<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> ton<00:01:22.430> following<00:01:23.430> them

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
with beta players a ton following them

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
with beta players a ton following them
through<00:01:23.729> raids<00:01:23.939> getting<00:01:24.330> their<00:01:24.450> feedback<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
through raids getting their feedback and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.220 
through raids getting their feedback and
then<00:01:25.500> improving<00:01:26.189> content<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:26.939> camp

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
then improving content which camp

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.470 
then improving content which camp
I<00:01:29.290> think<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.490> biggest<00:01:30.610> thing<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.940> be<00:01:31.090> excited

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
I think the biggest thing to be excited

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.880 
I think the biggest thing to be excited
about<00:01:31.630> with<00:01:31.870> our<00:01:32.020> raids<00:01:32.260> is<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:33.010> they<00:01:33.970> are

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
about with our raids is that they are

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.340 
about with our raids is that they are
the<00:01:35.890> best<00:01:36.190> blend<00:01:36.550> I've<00:01:36.850> seen<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.360> being<00:01:38.140> both

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
the best blend I've seen of being both

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940 
the best blend I've seen of being both
challenging<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.100> fun<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.620> fights

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
challenging and fun a lot of fights

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.740 
challenging and fun a lot of fights
sometimes<00:01:42.220> are<00:01:42.700> only<00:01:43.120> one<00:01:43.480> or<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.720> other

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
sometimes are only one or the other

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.810 
sometimes are only one or the other
they're<00:01:44.470> fun<00:01:44.800> but<00:01:45.130> they're<00:01:45.250> not<00:01:45.370> challenging

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
they're fun but they're not challenging

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.800 
they're fun but they're not challenging
at<00:01:45.970> all<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.300> then<00:01:46.390> they're<00:01:46.510> just<00:01:46.660> boring

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
at all and then they're just boring

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.870 
at all and then they're just boring
right<00:01:47.260> click<00:01:47.470> receive<00:01:47.770> loot<00:01:48.010> or<00:01:48.220> they're

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
right click receive loot or they're

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.940 
right click receive loot or they're
super<00:01:49.180> challenging<00:01:49.660> but<00:01:49.960> they're<00:01:50.260> not<00:01:50.500> fun<00:01:50.830> at

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
super challenging but they're not fun at

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.250 
super challenging but they're not fun at
all<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.460> then<00:01:51.640> it's<00:01:51.760> just<00:01:51.850> miserable<00:01:52.450> beating

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
all and then it's just miserable beating

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.960 
all and then it's just miserable beating
your<00:01:53.380> head<00:01:53.410> against<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> wall<00:01:54.010> I<00:01:54.280> really

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
your head against the wall I really

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.280 
your head against the wall I really
think<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.330> strongest<00:01:55.600> part<00:01:55.810> about<00:01:55.930> our<00:01:56.080> raids

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
think the strongest part about our raids

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.260 
think the strongest part about our raids
is<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.620> we've<00:01:56.740> we've<00:01:57.400> managed<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.000> really

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
is that we've we've managed to really

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.690 
is that we've we've managed to really
kind<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.720> pair<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.170> two<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.770> they're<00:02:00.070> they're

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
kind of pair the two so they're they're

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.520 
kind of pair the two so they're they're
really<00:02:01.240> challenging<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:01.930> they<00:02:02.020> push<00:02:02.260> players

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
really challenging and they push players

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.500 
really challenging and they push players
as<00:02:02.800> far<00:02:02.830> as<00:02:03.130> they<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.310> go<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:04.150> at<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.240> same

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
as far as they can go but at the same

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.180 
as far as they can go but at the same
time<00:02:04.720> they're<00:02:05.050> fun<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.380> they're<00:02:05.620> exciting

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
time they're fun and they're exciting

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.330 
time they're fun and they're exciting
and<00:02:06.520> there's<00:02:07.180> huge<00:02:07.740> moments<00:02:08.740> in<00:02:08.830> every<00:02:09.130> fight

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and there's huge moments in every fight

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.900 
and there's huge moments in every fight
and<00:02:09.580> stuff<00:02:09.790> like<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:11.400> after<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.490> graduated

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
actually probably during college I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
actually probably during college I
decided<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.610> was<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> first<00:02:15.910> time<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.150> really

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.270 
considered working in games as like a
viable<00:02:18.400> career<00:02:18.760> path<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.770> after<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.830> graduated

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
my position is seeing a concept or an

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
my position is seeing a concept or an
idea<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.890> literally<00:02:50.190> starts<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:50.940> a

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
idea that literally starts is like a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540 
idea that literally starts is like a
line<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.570> two<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.810> an<00:02:51.900> email<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.890> couple<00:02:53.460> of

line or two in an email or a couple of
badly<00:02:53.880> drawn<00:02:54.120> squares<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> whiteboard<00:02:54.900> go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
badly drawn squares on a whiteboard go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.940 
badly drawn squares on a whiteboard go
from<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.910> boring<00:02:57.600> core<00:02:57.930> concept<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.620> go<00:02:58.710> all

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
from that boring core concept and go all

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.650 
from that boring core concept and go all
the<00:02:59.070> way<00:02:59.100> through<00:02:59.400> art<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.910> design<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.570> then

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
the way through art and design and then

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.390 
the way through art and design and then
being<00:03:00.870> able<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.380> see<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.830> finished<00:03:02.010> product

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
being able to see the finished product

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.830 
being able to see the finished product
as<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> gets<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> players<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.600> stuff<00:03:03.750> like
