00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 check since my good hairstyle to me 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.649
 It's fascinated apart I did not take anything 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.660
 in doing it and I love it because I feel 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.320
 ready to go to something very glamorous and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.320
 vicent like this 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.440
 ok apart from this hairstyle will teach 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.420
 to make another also great and 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.520
 very easy and we are only going to need a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 comb or brush with plastic bristles and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.340
 that they are very separated a cream for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.309
 combing gauges of different thicknesses and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.949
 pins the first step is to moisten a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 little hair so it does not come out easier 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.230
 the hairstyle and now it's time for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.400
 put on our comb cream 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.440
 because apart from what it serves that is going to 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.629
 nourish the hair will make it more 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 easy to comb the and easier to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 focus our hair and let's take two 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.489
 strands of hair down the nape one 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.489
 left side and one right side 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.199
 ah 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 now he has done in his hair everything for 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.890
 back and let's take two again 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.040
 tufts one on each side but of 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 in front 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.729
 and we're going to make a half tail behind 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.549
 with the rest of the hair we will hold it 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.610
 in a very loose ponytail to the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.759
 half of what he receives and now we're going to 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.369
 sue this ponytail and we're going to put it 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.390
 inside the other league it sounds weird but 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.390
 the easy dry 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.760
 but do not be overwhelmed by everything that is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 happening here because we're going to cover it up 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.490
 our three appointments we are going to spend the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.620
 first one side 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.860
 very easy and we are going to hide it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.060
 within the shock and we hide and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.060
 we will adjust pin 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.489
 and now I 'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.959
 hairstyle that is very father and super easy 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.750
 we're also going to start moistening the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.170
 hair 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.820
 and we apply styling cream from as 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.220
 half down to not be too 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.800
 heavy our root for this hairstyle 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.020
 it's super good to make a streak 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.980
 on the side and we're going to start braiding 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.980
 from above 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.239
 and with a thin league we make a 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.239
 very short horse's tail 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.540
 and now if we incorporate our braid 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.540
 and we set them with past 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.960
 what remains the braid we can 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.420
 get in front like that you know 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.840
 work but with thinkers already what 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.620
 we adjust and if they can hide their league 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.620
 with the pin 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.880
 and natural and they stay that way I hope that they 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.010
 have liked very much look very 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.050
 beautiful with their new hairstyles and we 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.050
 let's continue to see in the videos goodbye
