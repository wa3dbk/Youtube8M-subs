it<00:02:00.580> did<00:02:00.759> have<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> smaller<00:02:01.539> magazine<00:02:02.140> size<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
it did have a smaller magazine size and

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.320 
it did have a smaller magazine size and
you<00:02:02.679> were<00:02:02.770> accustomed<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.490> with<00:02:03.640> pistols<00:02:04.119> only

you were accustomed to with pistols only
20<00:02:04.899> rounds<00:02:05.170> per<00:02:05.289> magazine<00:02:05.440> but<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.280> actually

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
20 rounds per magazine but it actually

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.460 
20 rounds per magazine but it actually
had<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.940> most<00:02:07.149> damage<00:02:07.569> among<00:02:07.810> pistols<00:02:08.259> in

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
had the most damage among pistols in

were<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.400> three<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:16.000> four<00:02:16.300> shot<00:02:16.599> kill<00:02:16.840> weapon<00:02:17.260> it

were a three to four shot kill weapon it

were a three to four shot kill weapon it
did<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.040> however<00:02:18.250> have<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> headshot

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
did not however have a headshot

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.490 
did not however have a headshot
multiplier<00:02:19.300> which<00:02:19.870> was<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> little<00:02:20.380> bit

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
multiplier which was a little bit

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940 
multiplier which was a little bit
strange<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.340> rathika<00:02:21.730> also<00:02:22.209> shot<00:02:22.450> at<00:02:22.950> 459

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
strange the rathika also shot at 459

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.830 
strange the rathika also shot at 459
rounds<00:02:24.340> per<00:02:24.520> minute<00:02:24.700> which<00:02:25.240> might<00:02:25.540> seem<00:02:25.810> like

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
rounds per minute which might seem like

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.690 
rounds per minute which might seem like
it's<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.319> lot<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.740> keep<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.160> mind<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
it's not a lot but keep in mind that the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's not a lot but keep in mind that the
Rafah<00:02:27.910> cos<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.750> three<00:02:29.020> round<00:02:29.200> burst<00:02:29.530> weapon

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
Rafah cos is a three round burst weapon

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.580 
Rafah cos is a three round burst weapon
which<00:02:30.489> means<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.209> were<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
which means that if you were to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.870 
which means that if you were to
continuously<00:02:32.590> shoot<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.430> would<00:02:33.550> be<00:02:33.700> at

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
continuously shoot it it would be at

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.520 
continuously shoot it it would be at
around<00:02:34.120> nine<00:02:34.480> hundred<00:02:34.900> rounds<00:02:35.050> per<00:02:35.380> minute

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
around nine hundred rounds per minute

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
around nine hundred rounds per minute
but<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.160> has<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> burst<00:02:36.640> delay<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.239> would

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
but it has a burst delay so you would

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.930 
but it has a burst delay so you would
expect<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.130> because<00:02:39.130> Lee<00:02:39.280> Roth<00:02:39.459> pika<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
expect that because Lee Roth pika is a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.570 
expect that because Lee Roth pika is a
burst<00:02:40.510> weapon<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.290> actually<00:02:41.709> has<00:02:41.860> very<00:02:41.890> low

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
burst weapon it actually has very low

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.700 
burst weapon it actually has very low
recoil<00:02:42.940> which<00:02:43.660> meant<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.170> weapon<00:02:44.530> was

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
recoil which meant that this weapon was

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.490 
recoil which meant that this weapon was
easy<00:02:45.040> to

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
easy to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.470

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
than the other maybe you just feel that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.199 
than the other maybe you just feel that
one<00:04:03.590> was<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:04.130> an<00:04:04.310> easier<00:04:04.670> weapon<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.180> use

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209

complain that the Rafi cos might be a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.620 
complain that the Rafi cos might be a
little<00:04:22.430> bit<00:04:22.580> more<00:04:22.729> versatile<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.360> fact

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
little bit more versatile in the fact

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.390 
little bit more versatile in the fact
that<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.080> use<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.560> close<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.100> at<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
that you can use it up close and at a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.120 
that you can use it up close and at a
distance<00:04:25.430> but<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.479> fact<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.960> b23r<00:04:27.650> had

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
distance but the fact that the b23r had

multiplier<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.250> shot<00:04:31.520> faster<00:04:32.060> than<00:04:32.270> the

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
multiplier and it shot faster than the

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.600 
multiplier and it shot faster than the
Rafi<00:04:32.780> cos<00:04:32.960> just<00:04:33.530> made<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> an<00:04:33.919> overall<00:04:34.400> better

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
