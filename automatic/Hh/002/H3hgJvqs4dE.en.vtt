some of them I can feel there's a lot of

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.740 
some of them I can feel there's a lot of
confidence<00:00:56.549> in<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.299> some<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.510> them

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
especially this year I can see it so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
especially this year I can see it so
much<00:01:14.420> yeah<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.689> girls<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.260> taller

much yeah the girls are much more taller

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.709 
much yeah the girls are much more taller
and<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:16.890> potential<00:01:17.820> compared<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> last<00:01:18.450> year

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
and more potential compared to last year

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.050 
and more potential compared to last year
very<00:01:19.350> less<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.770> Salazar<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.789> think

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
very less on Salazar about but I think

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.389 
very less on Salazar about but I think
this<00:01:21.390> year<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.960> addition<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:23.070> southern

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
this year the addition of the southern

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.399 
this year the addition of the southern
star<00:01:23.609> wall<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> think<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.899> creates<00:01:25.200> much

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
star wall I think it it creates much

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
star wall I think it it creates much
more<00:01:25.590> competition<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.579> girls<00:01:26.909> there

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
more competition because the girls there

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
more competition because the girls there
they<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.960> unique<00:01:28.380> looks<00:01:28.619> they're<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
they have unique looks they're not like

they have unique looks they're not like
as<00:01:29.369> Chinese<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> Indian<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:31.229> very<00:01:31.710> strong

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
as Chinese and Indian very very strong

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.010 
as Chinese and Indian very very strong
