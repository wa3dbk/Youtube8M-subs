00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.690
 the sticks 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.160
 two cucumbers 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 I cut 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 the figures gallery 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.290
 I will say that I bought 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.440
 athletic 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.110
 supermarket fall 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 the first is top 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.170
 it consists 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.280
 for the cake without tears 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.580
 it's different 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.560
 Very important 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.460
 and you put it in water 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 to soften it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.980
 we did not see at the ceremony 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.980
 I have on the cutting boards 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 it's a slice of ham 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 battle 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 it is a small editing quite fast enough and without parents 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 a little bit 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 to mount a master shot anything in it 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 a little bit of peanuts 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.790
 the goal is to roll fast and well targeted 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.060
 I take my fault 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 you have me 7 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 be careful 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 I fill every summer 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 there is little carbonaceous 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.849
 see the scroll 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.839
 my way 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.089
 these measures 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.739
 but at what cost 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.699
 I resume 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.689
 my slice of ham 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
 The paws 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.089
 I have 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.459
 a little bit of peanuts 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.459
 crunchy citigroup 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.829
 a little bit 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 I'm having trouble with the stable 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.309
 I turn 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.189
 I arrived here 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.189
 I am not taken back 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.509
 on the other side 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.509
 and I return 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 it was more than just letting it dry 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.779
 if spring my way 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.859
 it's super fast when you have all the ingredients 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.079
 so I watch the dish 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.019
 a simple pickup 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.729
 if this technique seems to roll I use mostly ham 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.889
 here are some pictures 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.929
