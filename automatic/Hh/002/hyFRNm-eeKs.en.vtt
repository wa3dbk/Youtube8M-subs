00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
pound rope winch and we decided to go

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.689 
pound rope winch and we decided to go
with<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> rope<00:00:52.800> winch<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> lot

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
with the rope winch because it's a lot

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
with the rope winch because it's a lot
safer<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.239> lot<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.510> secure<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
rope is under a lot less tension than a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
rope is under a lot less tension than a
cable<00:00:57.690> winch<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.559> metal<00:00:58.800> cable<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
cable winch would be a metal cable for

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
cable winch would be a metal cable for
any<00:00:59.910> reason<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> cable<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> snap<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
any reason that cable was to snap a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.930 
any reason that cable was to snap a
metal<00:01:02.010> cable<00:01:02.250> would<00:01:02.340> fly<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.609> over<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> place

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
metal cable would fly all over the place

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.030 
metal cable would fly all over the place
it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:03.840> dangerous<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it's a lot a lot more dangerous this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's a lot a lot more dangerous this
rope<00:01:05.460> winch<00:01:05.670> loses<00:01:06.030> its<00:01:06.150> kinetic<00:01:06.360> energy<00:01:06.750> much

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
rope winch loses its kinetic energy much

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
rope winch loses its kinetic energy much
faster<00:01:07.320> than<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.530> far<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> ground<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
faster than just far the ground so it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
faster than just far the ground so it's
much<00:01:08.369> safer<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:08.970> well

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
