 short close a good day 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.900
 during a new video of 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.340
 presentation video presentation of a 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.880
 brand new beautiful graphics card 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.580
 if nvidia the gtx 950 1 this is the last 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.739
 and annotate 2 GB 2 and DDR5 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.829
 we have about the entry level 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.870
 gamer a priori the map that we 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.269
 present comes to us from avg so has 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.220
 flawless finish with backplate and 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.470
 all this open the king of sinn all this 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.180
 we need to discover the map 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.320
 right now 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.089
 here is the map and how are you aiming 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.769
 can be found at vga and in terms of 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.350
 finish is simply splendid 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.979
 we find the e2 vga in the middle of the two 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 fans 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.479
 these are two 90 mm fans 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.699
 cool it only those of the 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.710
 chilling house aceists 2.0 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.409
 watch a little reminder the vga 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 I forged 10950 it's simply 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.619
 splendid 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.510
 the map needs pine friends for 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 operate hervÃ© on the top it's 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.460
 not and the finish is exemplary 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.260
 and then in the back the backplate with 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.380
 the vga engraved inside that's all 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.990
 just gorgeous a pcb and black 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.210
 to take no swear it's splendid 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.399
 at the video outputs we find 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.729
 an output dvi 3 output display port a 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.049
 hdmi output you still hope a ride 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.240
 of this graphics card which 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.920
 deduction 38 because she's really 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 just very very beautiful after we go 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 tackle the characteristics 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.420
 so this graphics card offers us 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 768 cuda cores 32 rop and 64 tenuous of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.040
 gigabyte of gddr5 interfaced in 128 bits 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.700
 the gpu is at 1203 but hardly basic 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.040
 with the boost going up to 1405 but my 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.930
 guys and memory and 1653 inadvertently the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.880
 pro card but especially that we had 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.180
 the chance to test it in is 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.250
 said and we did not have very good 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.489
 impressions 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.489
 see you soon
