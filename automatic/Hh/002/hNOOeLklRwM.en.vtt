only<00:06:15.229> the<00:06:15.349> white<00:06:15.530> was<00:06:15.800> available<00:06:16.069> I<00:06:16.370> don't

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
only the white was available I don't

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:17.879 
only the white was available I don't
have<00:06:16.789> a<00:06:16.819> big<00:06:16.970> problem<00:06:17.150> with<00:06:17.300> this<00:06:17.389> white

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
have a big problem with this white

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.930 
have a big problem with this white
because<00:06:18.889> it's<00:06:19.069> going<00:06:19.220> to<00:06:19.310> go<00:06:19.400> into<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.669> case

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
because it's going to go into a case

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.200 
because it's going to go into a case
anyway<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.780> hard<00:06:21.020> rigid<00:06:21.259> case<00:06:22.060> that'll<00:06:23.060> allow

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
anyway the hard rigid case that'll allow

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.790 
anyway the hard rigid case that'll allow
the<00:06:23.270> cameras<00:06:23.720> to<00:06:23.780> still<00:06:24.080> work<00:06:24.259> getting<00:06:24.620> the

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
the cameras to still work getting the

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.499 
the cameras to still work getting the
controls<00:06:25.160> that<00:06:25.280> still<00:06:25.520> work<00:06:25.699> but<00:06:25.729> my

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
controls that still work but my

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.240 
controls that still work but my
experience<00:06:26.990> with<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.169> iphone<00:06:27.500> taught<00:06:28.070> me

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
experience with the iphone taught me

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.890 
experience with the iphone taught me
that<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:28.490> need<00:06:28.639> a<00:06:28.669> hard<00:06:28.880> rigid<00:06:29.090> case<00:06:29.479> it<00:06:29.690> clips

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
that you need a hard rigid case it clips

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.379 
that you need a hard rigid case it clips
onto<00:06:30.110> the<00:06:30.320> phone<00:06:30.820> that'll<00:06:31.820> change<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.210> color

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
onto the phone that'll change the color

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.180 
onto the phone that'll change the color
of<00:06:32.449> the<00:06:32.690> phone<00:06:32.840> anyway<00:06:33.139> so<00:06:33.800> really<00:06:34.009> all<00:06:34.039> you're

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
of the phone anyway so really all you're

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.379 
of the phone anyway so really all you're
going<00:06:34.310> to<00:06:34.370> see<00:06:34.550> from<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:34.820> front<00:06:34.970> is<00:06:35.180> just

going to see from the front is just

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.170 
going to see from the front is just
these<00:06:35.539> little<00:06:35.720> edges<00:06:36.229> of<00:06:36.410> white<00:06:36.620> so<00:06:36.979> no<00:06:37.699> dramas

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
these little edges of white so no dramas

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.570 
these little edges of white so no dramas
not<00:06:38.419> a<00:06:38.449> big<00:06:38.630> deal<00:06:38.810> at<00:06:38.870> all<00:06:39.080> all<00:06:40.070> right<00:06:40.280> I<00:06:40.430> hope

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
so i'll show you which version it comes

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.140

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159 
all that sort of good stuff how much

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.580 
all that sort of good stuff how much
memory<00:06:58.340> it<00:06:58.490> has<00:06:58.580> what<00:06:59.479> the<00:06:59.690> quad<00:06:59.900> core<00:07:00.139> CPU<00:07:00.530> is

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
memory it has what the quad core CPU is

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.680 
memory it has what the quad core CPU is
actually<00:07:00.949> are<00:07:01.099> because<00:07:01.400> i'm<00:07:01.580> not<00:07:02.300> entirely

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
actually are because i'm not entirely

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.670 
actually are because i'm not entirely
sure<00:07:02.870> myself<00:07:03.110> i<00:07:03.590> think<00:07:03.830> that<00:07:04.630> 1.45<00:07:05.630> or<00:07:05.930> 1.40

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
sure myself i think that 1.45 or 1.40

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.620 
sure myself i think that 1.45 or 1.40
Giga<00:07:07.280> hurt<00:07:08.229> quad<00:07:09.229> core<00:07:10.000> so<00:07:11.000> they<00:07:11.120> bit<00:07:11.270> faster

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
Giga hurt quad core so they bit faster

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.620 
Giga hurt quad core so they bit faster
than<00:07:11.690> the<00:07:11.930> s2<00:07:12.710> I<00:07:12.919> did<00:07:13.310> consider<00:07:13.520> the<00:07:13.849> STS<00:07:14.389> to<00:07:14.570> it

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
than the s2 I did consider the STS to it

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.520 
than the s2 I did consider the STS to it
was<00:07:14.750> selling<00:07:15.050> for<00:07:15.880> 600<00:07:16.880> bucks<00:07:17.030> out<00:07:17.449> right<00:07:17.659> this
