00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:11.130
 story and david 1690 is unlikely this year 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.750
 I was born and here begins 10 seconds 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.380
 left now shorter we will see how i am 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 multiplayer crashing the very first turn 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.449
 I will not go far to the field here, so 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:32.219
 just want you to get ready for 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:34.910
 this moment here because the players are clearly 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 over 10 levels eighties level 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.520
 I do nâ€™t really believe against them 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.719
 and aching gamepad is holding a second term 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.649
 Well, she even this mass in an hour we will 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.360
 drive Vladimir ramming in the ass and need 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.660
 will turn off that fucking mic 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660
 have them 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.220
 so this is a peach round card even 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 the temperature is shown right there 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.860
 beetle in front of blue cool 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 try with a view from the steering wheel first let's 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.760
 come on let's get this burn he 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.300
 teleported cheater cheater anyway 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 lags brake lags and how to overtake 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.420
 interesting to know 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.810
 he is also underestimated some because of 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.710
 he brought me out of the track and not one 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:42.880
 me here it is multiplayer forza motorsport 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 5 3 teleport beetle and cheaters so on 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.450
 we will try to drive neatly 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 try to get at least to the finish with 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:02:02.860
 Scarlet is almost mad along the way so 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.039
 nothing happened all right yes all 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.750
 still not only oh you nifiga pavel 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.099
 teaches so still vibrates not only 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.459
 the gamepad itself is still under the crust 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:23.130
 small small engine points with a fig 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:23.130
 dacha lit such a need to call him back 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.209
 he turns us to God at all 0 then 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.590
 There is in this multiplayer about the very 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 big problem is not bump into 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.750
 people and try to pass cleanly 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.750
 turns that is in this whole thing 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.090
 optimal place maniac she about to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.260
 samsung there galaxy someone vkontaktik 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.260
 have written of them so well so come on let's 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.000
 neatly neatly 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:09.220
 neatly all the same vitus driving it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.800
 the most such class has the most 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.700
 informative the most convenient and most 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.640
 spectacular though then we won't see 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.540
 gorgeous model cars because 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.410
 model cars here are really 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:28.239
 gorgeous and all the other cars 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.180
 far so we admired our cars so 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 Well, it seems to me those are no longer catch up 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.750
 hell juliette from behind so so 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.750
 brake brake brake gas 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:52.030
 drift drift shorter forcing 3 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:53.709
 adam this gizmo rubber this 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.920
 blue then it is worth your trip 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.610
 From the game, well, then it's green but 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.610
 reach out to nature blue 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.710
 but those five of me hike not four 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.750
 I'm 5 4 I probably will not catch up 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:15.470
 so the main thing is to keep your place well 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.520
 hike judging by the map, I generally 2 from the end 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:23.030
 a third of the concert what's more behind us 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.190
 no one goes maybe me just 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.800
 the machine is so not powerful that I can not them 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.040
 catch up even on the straight lines 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 maybe the car here is not improving 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.130
 only externally but also by characteristics 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.710
 seemingly like 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.230
 come on come on come on and my path 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.640
 far from perfect to be able to catch up 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:53.980
 their here first came to us from 40 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:57.640
 seconds to get to the finish line 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:09.620
 let's gas gas and shit katun tattva 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:11.840
 afterburner 5 this green and very and finish 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.000
 Is there another circle ? 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.550
 we still have a chance they hike yes 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.490
 it's over it's already driving itself I'm still waiting 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.450
 press on gas motor masa-wakas himself 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.180
 already and so on me until then because then the fleet 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.960
 us grate black little machine then 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.960
 arrived 5 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:48.050
 but quite well here these headlights broke 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:49.490
 right on the lights still fight because 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.310
 that here is the right headlight we broke a 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:06:13.640
 left whole well for the first time not bad 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:16.960
 probably what it means to drive dorsing 3 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.230
 percent but we only know 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.440
