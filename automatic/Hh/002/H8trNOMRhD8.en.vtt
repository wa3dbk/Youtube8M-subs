00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.840
 ideas to decorate a rustic garden the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.600
 rustic style applied in any 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.300
 stay of our house manages to convert 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.960
 common and boring spaces in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.870
 complete wonders 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.420
 and this time we want to take advantage of 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.790
 all its attractions to deposit them 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.910
 in the garden that is where you can best 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.340
 appreciate 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.700
 there is no doubt that modern times 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.210
 little by little they are moving us away from the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.970
 nature the technology included in 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.660
 every area of our life and so too 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.420
 urbanization and pollution are 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.060
 some factors of this time that go 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 creating a distance between us and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.810
 nature 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 that's why those who have a garden 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 at home they should make the most of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.200
 this outdoor space and a good 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.340
 way to do it is decorating it in a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.520
 rural style 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.429
 but also to apply the rural style 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.460
 in the garden is also the best way 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.580
 to take advantage of this style 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.270
 decorative 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.270
 is the perfect combination one of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.240
 first ideas that we come up to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.060
 decorating a rustic garden is to create a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.670
 Orchard 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.210
 does not necessarily have to be a 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 large garden where we provide 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 but rather something small just 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.430
 Decorative border to give it a look 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.110
 more agricultural and integrated with other 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.650
 pretty plants 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.410
 with a few simple wooden drawers 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.230
 land fillings we can create 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.960
 a mini garden on a table for 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 to be able to move it where we have left more 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.000
 comfortable 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.690
 wood is a star material in 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.700
 decorations of rustic gardens 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.760
 always try to use materials 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.620
 own nature as well as 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.620
 it could be the stone 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.459
 the decorations with trunks are ideal 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.400
 for this purpose and best of all 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.860
 is that you can perform these 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 accessories that will contribute so much to the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.020
 aesthetics as to the functionality of the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.140
 space 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.690
 a common wooden planter becomes 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.510
 in an excellent complement for our 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.040
 rustic garden if we cut logs to the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.350
 medium and we adhere to its exterior 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.190
 You can also use the trunks in 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.870
 more complex creations as in hammocks 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.690
 built with dry trunks 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.110
 it is an element with an important value 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.170
 decorative but also we also 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.750
 It offers a space to relax and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.150
 rest outdoors while we have 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.209
 contact with the nature 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.209

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:06.480
