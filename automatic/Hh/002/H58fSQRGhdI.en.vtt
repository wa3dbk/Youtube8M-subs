00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.569 
hit enter it will run for about a minute
and<00:00:43.430> then<00:00:43.660> generate<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.840> report<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:45.739> this

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
and then generate a report now this

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.330 
and then generate a report now this
report<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.329> not<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:48.829> see<00:00:49.070> here<00:00:49.220> on

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
report is not just what you see here on

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.389 
report is not just what you see here on
the<00:00:49.370> screen<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:50.000> actually<00:00:50.329> saves<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.750> file

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399

file that it created that report on to

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.319 
file that it created that report on to
your<00:01:00.500> desktop<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.250> then<00:01:01.460> open<00:01:01.879> it<00:01:01.969> up<00:01:02.120> with

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
your desktop and then open it up with

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.600 
your desktop and then open it up with
your<00:01:02.420> browser<00:01:02.750> now<00:01:03.469> you'll<00:01:03.739> be<00:01:03.800> able<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.129> see

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
your browser now you'll be able to see

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.139 
your browser now you'll be able to see
this<00:01:04.940> report<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:05.899> actually<00:01:06.649> go<00:01:06.860> through<00:01:07.149> what

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
this report and actually go through what

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.719 
this report and actually go through what
it<00:01:08.330> found<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.680> example<00:01:09.740> i<00:01:10.190> overclocked

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
it found so for example i overclocked

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.940 
it found so for example i overclocked
this<00:01:10.970> machine<00:01:11.390> i<00:01:11.600> disable<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.470> lot<00:01:12.649> of<00:01:12.770> things

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
this machine i disable a lot of things

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.430 
this machine i disable a lot of things
on<00:01:13.130> purpose<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.390> analysis<00:01:14.960> here<00:01:15.289> is

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
on purpose so the analysis here is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.020 
on purpose so the analysis here is
saying<00:01:15.770> well<00:01:16.039> you've<00:01:16.310> got<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.729> things

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
saying well you've got a lot of things

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.630 
saying well you've got a lot of things
disabled<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.380> your<00:01:18.679> system<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.190> not<00:01:19.369> really

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
disabled so your system is not really

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.719 
disabled so your system is not really
energy-efficient<00:01:20.450> well<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:20.869> my<00:01:21.679> case<00:01:21.740> no<00:01:22.280> it's

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
energy-efficient well in my case no it's

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.699 
energy-efficient well in my case no it's
right<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.270> not<00:01:23.630> energy<00:01:24.140> efficient<00:01:24.560> because

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
right it's not energy efficient because

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.839 
right it's not energy efficient because
I<00:01:25.840> I'm<00:01:26.840> overclocking<00:01:27.709> on<00:01:27.830> purpose<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.429> need<00:01:28.700> to

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
I I'm overclocking on purpose I need to

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.760 
I I'm overclocking on purpose I need to
run<00:01:29.000> things<00:01:29.270> at<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> hundred<00:01:29.690> percent<00:01:29.929> i<00:01:30.380> have

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
run things at a hundred percent i have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.480 
run things at a hundred percent i have
my<00:01:31.190> energy<00:01:31.720> settings<00:01:32.720> set<00:01:33.080> too<00:01:33.229> high<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.099> in

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
my energy settings set too high so in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.180 
my energy settings set too high so in
your<00:01:35.240> case<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:36.020> might<00:01:36.200> find<00:01:36.440> things<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.890> you

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
your case you might find things that you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.240 
your case you might find things that you
have<00:01:37.369> disabled<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.179> you<00:01:38.330> wish<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.690> hadn't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
have disabled that you wish you hadn't

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.960 
have disabled that you wish you hadn't
disabled<00:01:40.250> them<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.520> maybe<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.729> want<00:01:40.910> to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
disabled them and maybe you want to

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.969 
disabled them and maybe you want to
enable<00:01:41.209> them<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.050> is<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.229> quick<00:01:42.530> easy<00:01:42.770> way

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
enable them so this is a quick easy way

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.859 
enable them so this is a quick easy way
of<00:01:43.160> getting<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.700> report<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.330> has<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.599> lot<00:01:44.840> of

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
of getting a report that has a lot of

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.199 
of getting a report that has a lot of
good<00:01:45.140> information<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.789> can<00:01:46.819> quickly

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
good information that you can quickly

and then you can go ahead then later on
and<00:02:00.080> change<00:02:00.289> your<00:02:00.470> energy<00:02:00.950> settings

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
and change your energy settings

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.150 
and change your energy settings
accordingly<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:03.229> what<00:02:03.410> it<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:04.039> you

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
accordingly to to what it is that you

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.300 
accordingly to to what it is that you
need<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.090> again<00:02:05.450> another<00:02:05.690> tip<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.380> windows<00:02:07.069> 7

need so again another tip on windows 7

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.370 
need so again another tip on windows 7
and<00:02:07.580> windows<00:02:07.670> XP<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.690> different<00:02:09.170> if<00:02:09.319> you
