00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.510
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.520
 fast from the name I think almost 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.830
 improbable or half-feathers 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.010
 puttanesca we go up with water where 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.270
 we will cook the pasta and go to cook 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.240
 these half pens 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.859
 in short, it is a pasta that cooks in approx 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.210
 11 minutes 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.179
 so in 11 minutes we will go to 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 finish this recipe here it is 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:40.110
 we light the fire under the patella 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.750
 let's put some oil in a clove of garlic 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.640
 whole that we will then remove and gods 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.609
 Salted anchovy fillets we have 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.190
 rinsed we removed the plug in the 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.649
 The central herringbone is kept in view 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.230
 so let's go and consider 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.390
 he made two ounces of pasta 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.350
 I will put about 56 fillets a chili pepper 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 fresh green if you have it are otherwise 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.330
 you can put the chili is normal 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.620
 I put the green one because it's less strong 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.170
 of the chili , however, is normal at that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.810
 that slight spicy taste that to me 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.730
 really like it and we're going to prepare the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.430
 tomatoes 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.990
 these are the tomatoes that we go to 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.880
 cut the 4 if you have some tomatoes 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.690
 the smaller you can see them 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.690
 quietly in half 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.929
 we raise the temperature so we have 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.700
 oil that is practically hot 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.359
 move the pan to focus and go to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:03.229
 throw the tomatoes like this and put it back 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:04.729
 immediately on the fire at this point we go 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.899
 add the capers 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:14.209
 these are pickled capers 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:20.450
 put two tablespoons let's do two 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.870
 spoons and a half but we must add 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.299
 you see it got a little too dry 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.390
 our on bettino so let's take a 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:34.790
 half a tablespoon of the cooking water there 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.230
 we go to come perfect let's go 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.790
 add the olives 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.099
 I'm using two types of olives 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 different I will put both green olives 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.109
 that still give a nice civita 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.220
 are there so that it is much sweeter 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:51.549
 I'm going to put at least two spoons 2 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.549
 3 tablespoons 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 we are going to test his cot for 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.810
 feel if the amount of salt is 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.489
 correct considering that it has that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.920
 we have anchovies inside I don't have 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:11.579
 added salt because the risk was 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:14.190
 that it was then too salty and not acid 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.500
 the right and in my opinion should not be added 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.099
 absolutely salt and quad to drain 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.049
 the pasta school always a little bit at 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.269
 tooth in such a way that I can then 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.849
 leave in the pot without the risk 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.440
 that shakes and adds to the 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.900
 his pan so you see I did 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.389
 a really rich but abundant sauce 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.909
 this pasta is good just because it is 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.799
 beautiful on what is here does not owe us 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.799
 be too liquid in this case 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.540
 you see it allows absorbed passing everything 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.120
 the liquid of his must be 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.609
 always so we are going to remove it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.379
 clove of garlic to avoid that then 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.980
 may end up on someone's plate 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.980
 does not appreciate it 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:18.340
 now only for those who like more than one 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.820
 light turn of oil that makes so much chef 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.920
 a pepper jelly and this is the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.080
 our version puttanesca the mezze 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.260
 pens that the botta ska 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.260
 enjoy your meal 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.860
