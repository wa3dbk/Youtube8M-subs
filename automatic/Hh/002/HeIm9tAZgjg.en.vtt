from<00:01:40.439> petzl<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.130> energizer<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.000> this

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
from petzl to some energizer and this

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.179 
from petzl to some energizer and this
actually<00:01:43.170> worked<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.009> one

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

much jess you imagine if they have some
depth<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.070> real<00:02:02.549> quick<00:02:02.759> let<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> show

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
depth to it so real quick let me to show

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
depth to it so real quick let me to show
you<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.360> easy<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> disassemble

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you how easy this was to disassemble

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
you how easy this was to disassemble
just<00:02:05.640> push<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.939> button<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.659> pops<00:02:06.930> out

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
just push this button here this pops out

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.779 
just push this button here this pops out
which<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.799> actually<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.099> breath<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.399> fresh<00:02:08.459> air

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
which is actually a breath of fresh air

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
which is actually a breath of fresh air
some<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.330> lights<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.200> very

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
some of these lights can be very very

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.100 
some of these lights can be very very
difficult<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:12.150> apart<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.930> add<00:02:13.080> new

the reason being if you bump it or
something<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.630> what<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> batteries

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
something they know what the batteries

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.720 
something they know what the batteries
you<00:02:16.200> go<00:02:16.320> spilling<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.580> one

so a lot of versatility in regards to
that<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.630> don't<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:46.110> many<00:02:46.350> kits<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.950> actually

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that I don't see many kits that actually

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.980 
that I don't see many kits that actually
come<00:02:47.490> with<00:02:47.520> everything<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.270> for<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> price
