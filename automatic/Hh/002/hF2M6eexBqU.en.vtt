boy<00:03:58.410> down<00:03:59.100> yeah<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> test<00:03:59.760> over<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> field<00:04:00.300> so

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
boy down yeah a test over the field so

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.670 
boy down yeah a test over the field so
we've<00:04:00.600> just<00:04:00.630> done<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.930> little<00:04:00.990> hill<00:04:01.350> session

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
we've just done a little hill session

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.060 
we've just done a little hill session
today

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
today

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.010 
today
obviously<00:04:02.970> we<00:04:03.030> had<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> tug-of-war<00:04:03.420> over<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
obviously we had a tug-of-war over the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.450 
obviously we had a tug-of-war over the
top<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.620> make<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.890> little<00:04:04.950> bit<00:04:05.130> harder

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
top just to make it a little bit harder

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.280 
top just to make it a little bit harder
so<00:04:05.610> it's<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> really<00:04:05.970> anaerobic<00:04:06.540> thing<00:04:06.750> these

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
so it's a really anaerobic thing these

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.660 
so it's a really anaerobic thing these
hills<00:04:07.560> are<00:04:07.680> hard<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.220> they've<00:04:08.370> all<00:04:08.490> run<00:04:08.610> on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
hills are hard and they've all run on

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.310 
hills are hard and they've all run on
really<00:04:08.970> well<00:04:09.150> become<00:04:09.570> good<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.900> pay<00:04:10.020> for<00:04:10.200> good

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
really well become good and pay for good

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.790 
really well become good and pay for good
boys

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
boys

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.699 
boys
now<00:04:10.920> past<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.459> hill<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.260> about<00:04:13.440> 10

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
now past the hill I think it's about 10

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.560 
now past the hill I think it's about 10
or<00:04:13.830> 50<00:04:14.100> meters<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.820> just<00:04:14.970> varies<00:04:15.300> in<00:04:15.450> its

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
or 50 meters and it just varies in its

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.479 
or 50 meters and it just varies in its
slope<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.080> not<00:04:16.170> too<00:04:16.320> bad<00:04:16.470> i<00:04:16.530> won<00:04:16.799> we've<00:04:17.370> got

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
slope it's not too bad i won we've got

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.979 
slope it's not too bad i won we've got
better<00:04:17.670> ones<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> good<00:04:18.900> one

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
better ones but this is a good one

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.390 
better ones but this is a good one
because<00:04:19.140> we<00:04:19.410> can<00:04:19.530> combine<00:04:19.859> things<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.250> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
because we can combine things like the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.150 
because we can combine things like the
tug-of-war<00:04:20.580> no<00:04:20.970> games<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:22.070> could<00:04:23.070> if

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
tug-of-war no games as well could if

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.130 
tug-of-war no games as well could if
they<00:04:23.280> were<00:04:23.370> coming<00:04:23.670> up<00:04:23.760> with<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.510> hands<00:04:24.810> join

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
they were coming up with a hands join

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.170 
they were coming up with a hands join
yes<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.800> had<00:04:25.950> rules<00:04:26.220> sometimes<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.760> had<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.910> join

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
yes I had rules sometimes I had to join

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.340 
yes I had rules sometimes I had to join
their<00:04:27.360> hands<00:04:27.540> sometimes<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.050> had<00:04:28.140> to<00:04:28.200> make<00:04:28.320> a

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
their hands sometimes I had to make a

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.260 
their hands sometimes I had to make a
pyramid<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.340> all<00:04:29.460> about<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.850> team

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
pyramid it was all about the team

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.580 
pyramid it was all about the team
bonding<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.750> team<00:04:30.960> because<00:04:31.140> we<00:04:31.230> got<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> lot<00:04:31.500> of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
bonding the team because we got a lot of
