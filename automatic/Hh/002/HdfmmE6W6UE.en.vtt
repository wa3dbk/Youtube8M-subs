00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello today we are going to learn to rid the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 machine and make quill machines 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 Sew sew with two threads one upper 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 that will come from the move and one lower 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 that comes from the tap so we have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.490
 to fill the thread bobbin to be able to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 insert the shuttle 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 we introduce the coil in the holder 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.259
 reels and we stretch the thread towards the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.259
 left side 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.350
 and we passed the thread through the screw 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.960
 sun from front to back inserting what 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.450
 in the notch making the end loose 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.739
 pass over the thread that comes from the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.510
 coil now we put the loose end down 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.809
 one of the side holes of the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.809
 quill 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.720
 we stretch the thread up 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.710
 we introduce the tap on the lever 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.690
 winner we move to its right position and 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.440
 step on the pedal holding the end 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.440
 loose up 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.800
 after a few turns we cut 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 the loose end flush with the tap and 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.430
 we continue to demand 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 this white cap tells us the capacity 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.180
 maximum of the tap when we see that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.790
 the volume of the thread is close to the top 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.640
 white we should stop as we see the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.160
 tap to the left and the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.470
 we bring the lever cut with 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.740
 scissors 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.990
 and we have the quill ready 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.500
 to thread the machine the first thing is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.630
 remove the thread from the tensioning screw e 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.840
 enter it in the thread guide to 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.509
 lower it down 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.299
 We passed the thread through the center of the 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.240
 tension discs now we had it 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.970
 around this tongue to go 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.460
 climbing up 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.590
 we keep it on the right side until 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.780
 get to the lever pulls threads and you 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.080
 we turn around from behind to go back to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 go down 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.490
 arrived at this point and depending on the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.470
 model and brand of your machine the thread 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.050
 You must go through a two or three tabs 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.660
 in this particular model you will go through 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 two one is this one and the other is a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.100
 little hook that is here in the part 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.100
 left 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.310
 now we celebrate the needle in front 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.359
 backwards it's easier if we go down 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.359
 first printed fabrics 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.530
 to insert the tap in the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.840
 We will hold the box of the following 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.450
 way with the thread coming out of the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 from above we will stretch and make sure 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.160
 that the tap rotates in the direction of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.500
 the hands of the clock we hold the thread 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.010
 and we introduce the bob pushing with 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.040
 the thumb sliding the thread 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.430
 by this notch to pass it underneath 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.220
 of the tab until it clicks subject 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.140
 the stretcher opening the tab to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.780
 make sure the tap is inside 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.959
 well clamped and does not fall 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.000
 enter the stretcher on the shuttle 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.660
 matching the top pinchito 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.970
 in the corresponding sample and without 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.020
 drop the tab make sure you're 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.450
 fitted in his now loose position 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.760
 to sew we need to raise the thread of 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.330
 the tap to the top for it 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.610
 we hold the thread with a finger 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.920
 and moving the steering wheel towards us 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.920
 we make the needle lower and raise once 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.470
 we stretch the thread from above 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.880
 and here we see that the bottom one comes out 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.680
 we must keep them both in the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.350
 space between the foot of prey 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.540
 fabrics and the needle plate and we stretch it 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.960
 backwards stretching about 15 or 20 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.130
 centimeters we have finished by hopefully 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.990
 that has served you everything that you 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.090
