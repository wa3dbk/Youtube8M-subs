the 8 inch piece flush on the bottom
side<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> start<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.110> putting<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
side and I'm going to start by putting a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
side and I'm going to start by putting a
screw<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.100> corner<00:00:41.399> making<00:00:41.820> sure<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> keep

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210

screw in one corner making sure to keep
it<00:00:42.390> flush<00:00:42.600> then<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> use<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it flush then I'm going to use a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950 
it flush then I'm going to use a
straight<00:00:44.309> edge<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.420> 2-inch<00:00:45.719> piece

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
straight edge because that 2-inch piece

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
straight edge because that 2-inch piece
can<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> skew<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.399> not

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
can get a skew a little bit if it's not

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
can get a skew a little bit if it's not
careful<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.690> double<00:00:48.960> checking<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
careful so I'm just double checking to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.959 
careful so I'm just double checking to
make<00:00:49.410> sure<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.860> nice<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.100> perfect<00:00:50.670> straight

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
make sure it's nice and perfect straight

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
make sure it's nice and perfect straight
and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.750> I'll<00:00:51.870> finish<00:00:52.079> putting<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> screws

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and then I'll finish putting the screws

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
and then I'll finish putting the screws
in<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> hold<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.640> place<00:00:53.760> while<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> glue

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
in to hold it in place while the glue

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:03.170 
in to hold it in place while the glue
dries<00:01:00.980> before<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> trim<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> excess<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.969> my

angle with the bed of the saw and then

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
angle with the bed of the saw and then
I'm<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> run<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:09.900> keeping

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I'm just going to run it down keeping

the left side of the saw up tight
against<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> fence<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.640> sure<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
against that fence to make sure I get a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.440 
against that fence to make sure I get a
nice<00:01:15.270> perfect<00:01:15.659> straight<00:01:16.320> line

going<00:01:23.980> to<00:01:24.130> slide<00:01:24.370> over<00:01:24.550> I<00:01:24.700> like<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.090> coat<00:01:25.300> it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
going to slide over I like to coat it

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.060 
going to slide over I like to coat it
with<00:01:25.570> furniture<00:01:25.990> wax<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.530> give<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.860> nice

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
with furniture wax to give it a nice

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.830 
with furniture wax to give it a nice
smooth<00:01:27.370> surface<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> tool<00:01:28.420> will<00:01:28.630> glide

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
smooth surface so the tool will glide

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.870 
smooth surface so the tool will glide
over<00:01:28.870> it<00:01:29.229> easily<00:01:29.530> now<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.400> make<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:33.700> even

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
over it easily now to make this even

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.310 
over it easily now to make this even
more<00:01:34.000> efficient<00:01:34.630> what<00:01:34.750> I'm<00:01:34.870> going<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.080> do<00:01:35.200> is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
more efficient what I'm going to do is

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.570 
more efficient what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:35.530> some<00:01:36.270> sticky<00:01:37.270> back<00:01:37.479> sanding<00:01:37.930> pads<00:01:38.580> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
take some sticky back sanding pads and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.850 
take some sticky back sanding pads and
I'm<00:01:40.060> going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> put<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.479> say<00:01:41.170> four<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.619> them<00:01:41.740> on

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
I'm going to put all say four of them on

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.160 
I'm going to put all say four of them on
the<00:01:41.979> back<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.190> here<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.630> great<00:01:43.960> blur

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the back of here so this is great blur

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.450 
the back of here so this is great blur

when you're cutting sheet goods
it<00:01:46.330> really<00:01:46.479> helps<00:01:46.840> hold<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.260> in<00:01:47.470> place<00:01:48.510> not

it really helps hold this in place not
in<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.750> clamp<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.229> you're<00:01:50.320> good<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.500> go

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
in the clamp and you're good to go

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.120 
in the clamp and you're good to go
and<00:01:51.100> if<00:01:51.280> you're<00:01:51.430> in<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.700> big<00:01:51.910> rush<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:53.950> put<00:01:54.100> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
and if you're in a big rush next put a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.590 
and if you're in a big rush next put a
little<00:01:54.340> down<00:01:54.460> pressure<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.000> not<00:01:55.119> use<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.300> clamp

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
little down pressure and not use a clamp

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.240 
little down pressure and not use a clamp
I<00:01:55.780> wouldn't<00:01:56.020> recommend<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.530> but<00:01:56.740> it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
I wouldn't recommend it but it's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.639 
I wouldn't recommend it but it's
possible<00:01:57.790> now<00:01:58.450> that's<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.810> bargain<00:01:59.050> under<00:01:59.350> here

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
possible now that's a bargain under here

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.080 
possible now that's a bargain under here
what<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.800> want<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.130> do<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.340> cut<00:02:00.550> some<00:02:00.700> rails<00:02:00.880> or

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
what I want to do is cut some rails or

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.999 
what I want to do is cut some rails or
styles<00:02:01.450> for<00:02:01.600> an<00:02:01.690> upcoming<00:02:01.810> furniture<00:02:02.530> project

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
styles for an upcoming furniture project

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.219 
styles for an upcoming furniture project
so<00:02:03.610> I've<00:02:03.729> set<00:02:03.970> my<00:02:04.119> tri<00:02:04.360> squared<00:02:04.720> in<00:02:04.869> just<00:02:05.080> over

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
so I've set my tri squared in just over

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.930 
so I've set my tri squared in just over
two<00:02:05.530> inches<00:02:05.770> because<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.160> want<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.520> thickness

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
two inches because I want the thickness

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.479 
two inches because I want the thickness
to<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.210> two<00:02:07.390> inches<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:07.990> I've<00:02:08.530> added<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.280> width

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
to be two inches so I've added the width

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.640 
to be two inches so I've added the width
of<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.729> blade<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.239> measurement<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.929> I'm

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
of the blade to my measurement and I'm

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.350 
of the blade to my measurement and I'm
just<00:02:11.860> going<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.040> set<00:02:12.280> just<00:02:13.060> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.239> use<00:02:13.330> my

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just going to set just going to use my

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.140 
just going to set just going to use my
try<00:02:13.750> quick<00:02:14.050> try<00:02:14.800> square<00:02:15.340> let<00:02:15.640> me<00:02:15.700> see<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:15.970> right

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
try quick try square let me see it right

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.900 
try quick try square let me see it right
as<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> guide<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.110> set<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.680> up<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.730> is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
as a guide to set this up now this is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.940 
as a guide to set this up now this is
for<00:02:22.090> demonstration<00:02:22.750> purposes<00:02:23.290> obviously<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
for demonstration purposes obviously you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.009 
for demonstration purposes obviously you
want<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> clamp<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.790> jig<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.420> this<00:02:25.810> down

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
want to clamp a jig like this down

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.990 
want to clamp a jig like this down
whenever<00:02:26.290> possible<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.610> want<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.820> show<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
whenever possible but I want to show you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.900 
whenever possible but I want to show you
how<00:02:28.180> well<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:29.019> works<00:02:29.320> with<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
how well it works with just the the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:47.679 
how well it works with just the the
sandpaper

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.000 

so<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.900> advantage<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.470> doing<00:02:49.560> something<00:02:49.890> like

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
so the advantage of doing something like

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
so the advantage of doing something like
that<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:50.939> just<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.180> an<00:02:51.269> axillary<00:02:51.720> piece

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that and I just have an axillary piece

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
that and I just have an axillary piece
behind<00:02:52.110> here<00:02:52.530> because<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:52.980> not<00:02:53.129> big<00:02:53.430> enough

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
behind here because it's not big enough

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.890 
behind here because it's not big enough
is<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.769> very<00:02:56.489> accurately<00:02:56.900> repeat

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
is that you can very accurately repeat

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:25.480 
is that you can very accurately repeat
that<00:02:58.110> cut<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:59.329> quickly<00:03:00.329> as<00:03:00.480> well

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.920 

so<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.670> quick<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:26.970> easy<00:03:27.240> I've<00:03:27.480> got<00:03:27.720> two

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
so that quick and easy I've got two

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.660 
so that quick and easy I've got two
rails<00:03:28.230> or<00:03:28.470> two<00:03:28.620> styles<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.400> use<00:03:29.550> them

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
rails or two styles that I can use them

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.400 
rails or two styles that I can use them
my<00:03:29.820> next<00:03:30.030> coming<00:03:30.270> project<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> are<00:03:30.990> exactly

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
my next coming project that are exactly

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:44.380 
my next coming project that are exactly
the<00:03:31.530> same<00:03:31.560> thickness

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.450
