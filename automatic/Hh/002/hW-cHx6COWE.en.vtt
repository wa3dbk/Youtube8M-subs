like<00:02:46.620> twins<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.880> go<00:02:48.090> into<00:02:48.270> this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
like twins we don't really go into this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.030 
like twins we don't really go into this
area<00:02:48.570> too<00:02:48.810> much<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> farmers

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
area too much is just from the farmers

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.310 
area too much is just from the farmers
and<00:02:50.459> their<00:02:51.060> kind<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.390> kick<00:02:51.540> her<00:02:51.840> hat<00:02:52.020> if<00:02:52.230> we

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
and their kind of kick her hat if we

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600 
and their kind of kick her hat if we
show<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.739> crops<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.250> being<00:02:53.400> so

on the floor for ugc as obstacles
everybody<00:03:44.820> we<00:03:45.030> take<00:03:45.269> apart<00:03:45.540> at<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.720> moment<00:03:46.110> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
everybody we take apart at the moment is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.650 
everybody we take apart at the moment is
from<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.440> UGC<00:03:46.560> community<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.390> look<00:03:48.510> at<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
from the UGC community and look at the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.970 
from the UGC community and look at the
second<00:03:48.989> floor<00:03:49.110> which<00:03:49.380> was<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.769> be<00:03:49.860> where

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
second floor which was going to be where

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.590 
second floor which was going to be where
the<00:03:50.100> chess<00:03:50.310> car<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.150> put<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.420> big

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
the chess car but because I put a big

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.530 
the chess car but because I put a big
thus<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.200> phallic<00:03:52.590> symbol<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.430> ceiling<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
thus a phallic symbol on the ceiling and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.750 
thus a phallic symbol on the ceiling and
I<00:03:54.720> decided<00:03:55.230> not<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.769> put<00:03:56.220> chest<00:03:56.459> in<00:03:56.610> here

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
I decided not to put chest in here

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.000 
I decided not to put chest in here
anymore<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:58.350> one<00:03:58.500> thing<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.799> need<00:03:58.950> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
anymore and the one thing you need to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.680 
anymore and the one thing you need to
remember<00:03:59.160> when<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.850> are<00:03:59.880> messing<00:04:00.329> with<00:04:00.360> lava

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
remember when you are messing with lava

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.949 
remember when you are messing with lava
and<00:04:01.200> would<00:04:01.950> obviously<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:03.120> does<00:04:03.420> sell<00:04:03.660> fire

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
and would obviously it does sell fire

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.380 
and would obviously it does sell fire
quite<00:04:04.320> easily<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:04.950> you've<00:04:05.610> really<00:04:05.880> really

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
quite easily so you've really really

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.539 
quite easily so you've really really
careful<00:04:06.840> tech<00:04:07.350> auto<00:04:07.590> setting<00:04:08.130> forth<00:04:08.340> because

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
careful tech auto setting forth because

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.400 
careful tech auto setting forth because
if<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.000> auto<00:04:09.180> saves<00:04:09.630> once<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.320> on

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
if the auto saves once you have it on

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.100 
if the auto saves once you have it on
fire<00:04:10.620> pretty<00:04:11.519> much<00:04:11.700> screwed<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.540> obviously

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
fire pretty much screwed and obviously

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.170 
fire pretty much screwed and obviously
save<00:04:13.440> regularly<00:04:13.799> yourself<00:04:14.519> when<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.030> know

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
save regularly yourself when you know

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.430 
save regularly yourself when you know

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
it is a very long one if you go to my

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.010 
it is a very long one if you go to my
previous<00:04:33.250> videos<00:04:33.819> the<00:04:34.240> loner<00:04:34.449> leader<00:04:34.599> in<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
previous videos the loner leader in the
