 Welcome once again to me 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.589
 channel how are all my beauties 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.200
 Latin American a great kiss for 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.200
 all of you here I am again with a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.410
 new tutorial and it's a little different 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
 may be making him the color of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 my friend's hair she did not want 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.570
 make yourself dance and we were looking for a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.029
 healthier way of doing hair without 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 have to mistreat both the tips and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.309
 this we decided to raise a little the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 color of the roots and that will combine a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.870
 little more with the rest of your hair without 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.290
 have to do all the work so 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 if you want to see as recreation as I did 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.539
 please keep ect fairy today I'm going to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 be using the colors of fly 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.309
 the mix that I've made to her for 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.770
 to lift the root a little without going 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 very clear and make it a little natural 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.219
 I'm going to use only the 7-2 that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.800
 It would be the mate as she does not have gray hair 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.960
 Well, you do not need a mix 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.360
 for gray hair or I'll leave it only 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 with this color this color helps me 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.380
 neutralize colors that we do not want 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.000
 like the very advanced colors or 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 yellowish I like this color a lot 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.490
 that's why because they neutralize a lot 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.020
 the colors that we do not want and I'm going to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.550
 start doing divisions as they are 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 watching at this moment and I'm going to 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.210
 start applying in the dark part of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.050
 the root only to break that color 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 dark and lift the base of the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.420
 my friend's hair are still dividing and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.650
 they keep putting the color logically 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.530
 until we finish with the whole head 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.049
 when we finish with the whole head what 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 what we do is that we wait between 35 to 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.049
 45 minutes in the case of her only 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.479
 I'm going to leave for 35 minutes and then what 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.180
 I'm going to wash now I'm going to proceed and I'm going to 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.789
 use this sebastian product that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.039
 It's a cellophane and the color is blond 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.819
 glacial the reason why I'm going to 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.310
 use this product is for two one is 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.400
 because it really gives a shine and a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 body and a hair life and spectacular 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 and the other one is because it's really good 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.739
 good to neutralize the colors that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.190
 we do not want at this time that they would be 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.610
 the colors yellowish or orange 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.480
 One way I'm going to apply it is the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.060
 next in this case I do not use the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.330
 brush because it is a short hair and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.489
 it really is not that abundant I 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.160
 placed in my hand and I proceed to take it 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.070
 in the hair in parts and I know 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.770
 but at the same time try to brush it 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.470
 with a strand brush is fine 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.020
 separated and in a very delicate way 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 because we do not want this to break the hair 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.250
 especially as we are doing a 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.580
 chemical after it finished being applied 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.460
 what in all your hair are we going to put a 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.680
 this plastic hat in this case 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.200
 I did not have a plastic hat and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.840
 we had to put a bag of tablets 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.150
 but it did not work 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.510
 in this case we were not even visiting 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.270
 we were still in the house so I grabbed 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.610
 a towel and the woman I put in the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.380
 microwave and I put it on top to 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.300
 warm up a bit the reason why 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.640
 I do this is to open a little 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.030
 cuticle part of the hair and that the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.030
 color penetrate this way I'm going to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.340
 refresh the color of the tips and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.670
 I will give a little more life without having 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.400
 what to put in the very strong chemical we go 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470
 to start cutting his hair I'm not going to 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.610
 put the whole cut because really not 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.530
 I'm doing nothing otherworldly 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.300
 simply what I am doing is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.610
 try 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.250
 clean a little and make it 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 maintenance to the cut so that the hair 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.540
 Look more alive then let's take what 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.810
 I 'm going to use this more than marro 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.020
 comfortable in all the hair and this product 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.400
 pixar requires is great for 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.860
 roots of truth that gives a volume 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.870
 spectacular we just put directly to 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.780
 the roots and then distribute them 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.880
 for the rest of life of the hair 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.020
 I'm going to start drying my hair and 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.510
 how we do is 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.350
 dividing it we're going to start from the part 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.240
 from behind the hair down we go to 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.160
 start going on that side after little to 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.890
 little we are going down the divisions and 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.780
 let's get the hair done make sure that the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.140
 hair is very dry do not leave anything 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.570
 wet because if it does not stay sponge 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.850
 I believe that this is the secret of a 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.360
 good drying make sure you hair 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.100
 stay dry as well as we 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.410
 continue to make their divisions and follow 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.850
 drying his hair making sure as I said 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.850
 before he thinks 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:48.220
 and I will pay a little more attention 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.630
 in what is the part of the crown for 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.820
 the simple reason that we want a 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.190
 little bit more volume up there 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.720
 I will not address in the sense 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.460
 opposite of where I'm going to place it 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.360
 just to give it a little more 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.240
 volume these are the final results 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.970
