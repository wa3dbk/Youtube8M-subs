00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 I think the effect time can already be a while 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.120
 in this process 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.979
 the collaboration actually arises a bit right 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.880
 what do you have our website i am so that my wardrobe go and there i found 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.940
 attorney de klippen the blocks just above 20 degrees zaandam is this news 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.520
 You can see he saw something during the month of July with the local

 And who no longer indicates the severity of the crisis that makes them get one already 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 done a few times and turning the upper chamber inside out 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.900
 and determined on the other side 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.569
 alonso on the map and in 2010 and that is why we were charged the load 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.770
 because it is therefore very easy 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.060
 the pov can save the land 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.670
 so that won't happen 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.040
 and otherwise it all writes a bit to take the pants that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 were working and managing 50 centimeters cut 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.420
 and then you can do your best and ask us 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.149

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.149

 on 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.540
 that is how it started 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.390
 now the drama series 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.740

 can no longer get a frame of the images 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.589
 parking at the operation became the Leiden reach 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.559
 if not then you walk 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.939

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.969
 If you handbag too much on the field if you reach your wrong job 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.229
 This one just takes me back I was waiting for Clijsters to sleep 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.489
