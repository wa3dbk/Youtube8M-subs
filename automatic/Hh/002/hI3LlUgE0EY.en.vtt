you get a bit of movement in a certain
direction

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.069 
Mason I backed the nicely brace really
clean<00:00:36.690> edges<00:00:37.310> but<00:00:38.310> it's<00:00:38.610> also<00:00:39.510> incredibly

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
clean edges but it's also incredibly

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
clean edges but it's also incredibly
smooth<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.820> an<00:00:41.910> art<00:00:42.090> board

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329

smooth they do put out an art board
which<00:00:42.720> I<00:00:42.810> think<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> bit<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.320> texture<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
which I think has a bit more texture I

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.210 
which I think has a bit more texture I
typically<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.530> tooth<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.070> my

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
typically like a bit of tooth to my

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.350 
typically like a bit of tooth to my
canvas<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.059> board<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:50.090> rather<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.300> just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
canvas and my board so rather than just

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.940 
canvas and my board so rather than just
scuff<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.200> bit<00:00:52.380> with<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.649> sandpaper

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
scuff this up a bit with some sandpaper

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.770 
scuff this up a bit with some sandpaper
I'm<00:00:53.370> gonna<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.640> ahead<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> thin<00:00:54.450> coat

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I'm gonna go ahead and put a thin coat

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
I'm gonna go ahead and put a thin coat
of<00:00:55.230> gesso<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.579> that's

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of gesso on here but in a way that's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
of gesso on here but in a way that's
gonna<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.540> textured<00:00:58.520> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
gonna make it a bit more textured so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.260 
gonna make it a bit more textured so
what<00:00:59.700> we're<00:00:59.850> gonna<00:00:59.969> need<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:01.579> gesso<00:01:02.579> you

shapes and sizes even tints one good

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
shapes and sizes even tints one good
thing<00:01:08.459> to<00:01:08.549> remember<00:01:08.639> is<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.299> better<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.719> do

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
thing to remember is it's better to do

thing to remember is it's better to do
several<00:01:10.259> coats<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.560> gesso<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:11.069> you're

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
several coats of gesso if you're

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.129 
several coats of gesso if you're
starting<00:01:11.399> with<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.639> raw<00:01:11.759> canvas<00:01:12.179> or<00:01:12.869> wah

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
board so just one large one but you

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.249 
board so just one large one but you
should<00:01:17.549> always<00:01:17.670> spin<00:01:17.999> it<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.209> and<00:01:18.630> sand<00:01:19.109> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
should always spin it out and sand in

I've<00:01:49.919> been<00:01:49.950> smoother<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:52.169> want

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
I've been smoother because I don't want

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.260 
I've been smoother because I don't want
that<00:01:52.469> board<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.399> texture<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> border<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that board the texture the border to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.839 
that board the texture the border to
detract<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.169> actual<00:01:55.560> painting<00:01:55.919> so

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
detract from the actual painting so

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.459 
detract from the actual painting so
let's<00:01:57.389> go<00:01:57.509> outside<00:01:57.749> and<00:01:57.899> I'll<00:01:57.990> show<00:01:58.169> you<00:01:58.289> how<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
let's go outside and I'll show you how I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.100 
let's go outside and I'll show you how I
do<00:01:58.709> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.920 

okay<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.160> we're<00:02:02.520> outside<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.720> went<00:02:03.870> ahead

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
okay so we're outside and I went ahead

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.500 
okay so we're outside and I went ahead
and<00:02:04.110> put<00:02:04.230> down<00:02:04.260> a<00:02:04.380> piece<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.650> cloth<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.160> to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
and put down a piece of cloth just to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.650 
and put down a piece of cloth just to
spare<00:02:06.510> my<00:02:06.720> rocks<00:02:07.590> from<00:02:07.800> getting<00:02:08.040> Jess<00:02:08.220> out

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
spare my rocks from getting Jess out

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.940 
spare my rocks from getting Jess out
first<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.780> I'll<00:02:09.869> usually<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.470> take<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
first thing I'll usually do is take a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.560 
first thing I'll usually do is take a
little<00:02:11.520> mouse<00:02:11.670> sander<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
little mouse sander and just kind of

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.150 
little mouse sander and just kind of
scuff<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.110> real<00:02:13.320> quick<00:02:13.500> I'm<00:02:13.950> gonna<00:02:14.070> go

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
scuff it up real quick I'm gonna go

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.940 
scuff it up real quick I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.340> show<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:16.470> doesn't<00:02:16.800> have

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
ahead and show you that it doesn't have

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.310 
ahead and show you that it doesn't have
to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.250> perfect<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.960> want<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.170> give

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
to be perfect it just you want to give

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.860 
to be perfect it just you want to give
it<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> little<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> make<00:02:21.750> sure

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it a little bit of you want to make sure

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.120 
it a little bit of you want to make sure
that<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> gesso<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.530> actually<00:02:22.770> stick<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
that the gesso can actually stick to a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:43.449 
that the gesso can actually stick to a
little<00:02:23.400> bit

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.190 

and<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.760> will<00:02:44.940> typically<00:02:45.450> use<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:45.959> rough

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and I will typically use a pretty rough

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.780 
and I will typically use a pretty rough
stamp<00:02:46.440> paper<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.459> know<00:02:47.550> you're<00:02:47.670> not

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
stamp paper for that you know you're not

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.920 
stamp paper for that you know you're not
trying<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> smooth<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.540> you're<00:02:48.720> trying<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
trying to smooth it out you're trying to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.690 
trying to smooth it out you're trying to
scuff<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.170> up

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
scuff it up

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.880 
scuff it up
so<00:02:50.700> I've<00:02:50.790> already<00:02:50.910> loaded<00:02:54.140> my<00:02:55.140> paint<00:02:55.680> sprayer

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
so I've already loaded my paint sprayer

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.580 
so I've already loaded my paint sprayer
with<00:02:56.489> some<00:02:56.640> gesso<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:01.200> cool<00:03:01.380> thing<00:03:01.530> about

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
with some gesso the cool thing about

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.830 
with some gesso the cool thing about
these<00:03:01.880> sprayers<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:02.970> come<00:03:03.360> out<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> bit<00:03:03.690> lumpy

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
these sprayers that come out a bit lumpy

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.420 
these sprayers that come out a bit lumpy
sometimes<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.100> what<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.400> looking

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
sometimes and that's what I'm looking

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.530 
sometimes and that's what I'm looking
for

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
for

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.809 
for
I<00:03:06.569> went<00:03:07.530> ahead<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.800> diluted<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.700> it's

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
I went ahead and diluted it and it's

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.490 
I went ahead and diluted it and it's
already<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.209> hearing<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.510> reservoir<00:03:09.870> all<00:03:10.440> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
already just hearing the reservoir all I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.600 
already just hearing the reservoir all I
have<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.680> do<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.860> pull<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.069> trigger<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.489> it's

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
have to do is pull the trigger and it's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.910 
have to do is pull the trigger and it's
going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.849> ahead<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.709> shoot<00:03:13.709> out<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to go ahead and shoot out the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.400 
going to go ahead and shoot out the
gesso<00:03:14.160> obviously<00:03:14.670> these<00:03:15.209> sprayers<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.230> meant

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
gesso obviously these sprayers I meant

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.620 
gesso obviously these sprayers I meant
to<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.620> when<00:03:17.430> you're<00:03:17.580> spraying<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.269> vertical

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
to be when you're spraying a vertical

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.000 
to be when you're spraying a vertical
surface<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.080> I'm<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.290> tilt<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.650> up<00:03:19.739> with<00:03:19.950> my

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
surface so I'm a tilt this up with my

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.340 
surface so I'm a tilt this up with my
hand<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.480> go<00:03:21.900> ahead<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.110> apply<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
hand but I go ahead and apply the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:04:05.910 
hand but I go ahead and apply the
testing<00:03:22.680> right<00:03:22.769> now

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.590 

jemelle<00:04:06.920> pretty<00:04:07.070> fast<00:04:07.310> there<00:04:07.460> at<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.670> end<00:04:07.790> but

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
jemelle pretty fast there at the end but

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.990 
jemelle pretty fast there at the end but
as<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.900> see<00:04:09.340> when<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.430> spray<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:13.000> don't

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
as you can see when you spray it I don't

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.280 
as you can see when you spray it I don't
if<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.240> catch<00:04:14.390> on<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.570> camera<00:04:14.960> maybe

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
if you can catch on the camera maybe

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.380 
if you can catch on the camera maybe
I'll<00:04:15.410> zoom<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.740> but<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.459> can<00:04:16.609> see<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.910> clumps

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
I'll zoom in but you can see this clumps

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.020 
I'll zoom in but you can see this clumps
and<00:04:17.510> there's<00:04:17.810> like<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> fine<00:04:18.650> bit<00:04:18.890> too<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:20.000> I

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
and there's like a fine bit too so I

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.310 
and there's like a fine bit too so I
think<00:04:20.180> it's<00:04:20.390> gonna<00:04:20.480> give<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.780> more<00:04:20.930> toothsome

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
think it's gonna give it more toothsome

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.380 
think it's gonna give it more toothsome
and<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.769> could<00:04:22.430> go<00:04:22.580> muck<00:04:22.760> around<00:04:22.880> with<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.210> I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
and I could go muck around with this I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.930 
and I could go muck around with this I
could<00:04:23.510> sand<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.650> several<00:04:24.920> coats

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
could sand it to do several coats

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.900 
could sand it to do several coats
if<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.110> were<00:04:27.200> spraying<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.560> panel<00:04:27.890> or<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> canvas<00:04:28.610> I

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
if I were spraying a panel or a canvas I

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.310 
if I were spraying a panel or a canvas I
would<00:04:29.030> use<00:04:29.180> several<00:04:29.510> coats<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.930> sanding

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
would use several coats of this sanding

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.220 
would use several coats of this sanding
in<00:04:30.380> between<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.630> one<00:04:32.750> thing<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.930> watch<00:04:33.050> out

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
in between the one thing to watch out
