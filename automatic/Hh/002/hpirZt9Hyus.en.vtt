00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
groundwork for where I'm coming from

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
groundwork for where I'm coming from
obviously<00:00:16.890> I've<00:00:17.279> got<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> few<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.029> facts<00:00:18.359> here

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
obviously it's the basis for a lot of my

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.390 
obviously it's the basis for a lot of my
work<00:00:22.470> yeah<00:00:23.010> sure<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.330> obviously<00:00:24.949> this<00:00:25.949> this

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
work yeah sure and obviously this this

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.689 
work yeah sure and obviously this this
number<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.910> 11<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.510> 11<00:00:27.930> 11<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:29.429> appears

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
number this 11 this 11 11 is it appears

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
number this 11 this 11 11 is it appears
it<00:00:30.210> seems<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> work<00:00:30.599> itself<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it seems to work itself into a lot of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.240 
it seems to work itself into a lot of
things

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
things

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090 
things
I<00:00:32.360> mean<00:00:33.360> predominantly<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> first<00:00:34.710> thing<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I mean predominantly the first thing is

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000 
I mean predominantly the first thing is
the<00:00:35.520> universe<00:00:35.940> itself<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.750> obviously<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the universe itself and obviously on the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.530 
the universe itself and obviously on the
11th<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> August<00:00:38.730> 1999<00:00:39.739> 11<00:00:40.739> 11<00:00:41.730> 11<00:00:41.790> a.m.<00:00:42.270> there

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
11th of August 1999 11 11 11 a.m. there

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
11th of August 1999 11 11 11 a.m. there
was<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> total<00:00:42.960> solar<00:00:43.320> eclipse

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
was a total solar eclipse

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.299 
was a total solar eclipse
there<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.309> observed<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:44.879> Europe<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.309> he

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
there was observed through Europe and he

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
there was observed through Europe and he
moved<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.640> further<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.780> end<00:00:48.930> date

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
moved that up further on on the end date

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.029 
moved that up further on on the end date
December<00:00:49.620> 21st<00:00:50.460> 2012<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.960> end<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> main

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
December 21st 2012 the end a of the main

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.160 
December 21st 2012 the end a of the main
calendar<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.120> winter<00:00:54.360> solstice<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
calendar the winter solstice which is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
calendar the winter solstice which is
when<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> calendar<00:00:55.739> ends<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.370> 11:11<00:00:57.090> a.m.

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
when the calendar ends is at 11:11 a.m.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
when the calendar ends is at 11:11 a.m.
so<00:00:57.719> obviously<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.190> we've<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.579> we've<00:00:59.910> got

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so obviously so we've got this we've got

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
so obviously so we've got this we've got
this<00:01:00.120> effect<00:01:00.510> where<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> university<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this effect where the university is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529 
this effect where the university is
ringing<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:01.859> numbers<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
ringing these numbers out you know in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
ringing these numbers out you know in
accordance<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> consciousness<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
accordance to the consciousness and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390 
accordance to the consciousness and
stuff<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> look<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.159> an

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
stuff and when you look at it in an

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.719 
stuff and when you look at it in an
astrological<00:01:08.880> sense<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
astrological sense with the you know the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
astrological sense with the you know the
precession<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> equinoxes<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
precession of the equinoxes and the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
precession of the equinoxes and the
26,000<00:01:14.189> years<00:01:14.340> cycle<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> earth<00:01:15.180> wobbling

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
26,000 years cycle of the earth wobbling

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.370 
26,000 years cycle of the earth wobbling
through<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
through the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
through the
12<00:01:17.250> signs<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> zodiac<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:19.380> said<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> be

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
12 signs of the zodiac and we said to be

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
12 signs of the zodiac and we said to be
moving<00:01:20.040> into<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> New<00:01:20.490> Age<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> Aquarius<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
moving into the New Age of Aquarius and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.399 
moving into the New Age of Aquarius and
Aquarius<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> 11th<00:01:23.340> astrological<00:01:24.090> sign

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
Aquarius is the 11th astrological sign

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.609 
Aquarius is the 11th astrological sign
and<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.909> go<00:01:26.909> further<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.500> at

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and so go further into it you look at

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
and so go further into it you look at
the<00:01:28.710> numbers<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.250> 21<00:01:30.150> 12<00:01:30.479> 2012<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> add

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the numbers of 21 12 2012 and you add

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
the numbers of 21 12 2012 and you add
all<00:01:32.189> those<00:01:32.369> numbers<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.570> 11

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
all those numbers up and you get an 11

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
all those numbers up and you get an 11
and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.220> into<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> Sun<00:01:35.939> for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and then you look into the Sun for

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
and then you look into the Sun for
instance<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> sunspot<00:01:37.200> cycles<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.829> 11

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
instance and the sunspot cycles for 11

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
instance and the sunspot cycles for 11
years<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.360> everything

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
years and basically everything

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
years and basically everything
everything<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.490> keep

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
everything that you can just keep

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
everything that you can just keep
finding<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.180> 11th<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.750> things<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
finding these 11th out things and you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.810 
finding these 11th out things and you
could<00:01:43.649> argue<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> looking<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
could argue that are you looking for

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.350 
could argue that are you looking for
them<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.170> basically<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:48.030> amount

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
them but basically when it's that amount

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
them but basically when it's that amount
of<00:01:48.450> things<00:01:48.659> within<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> universe<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.680> not

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
of things within the universe it's not

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.960 
of things within the universe it's not
like<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.070> looking<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.549> because<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:50.880> are

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
like I'm looking for a because they are

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
like I'm looking for a because they are
there<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> can't<00:01:51.990> deny<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there yeah you can't deny that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.950 
there yeah you can't deny that
and<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> start<00:01:54.390> moving<00:01:54.810> into

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and so then you like start moving into

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.249 
and so then you like start moving into
the<00:01:55.829> numerology<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.570> instance<00:01:57.930> if

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the numerology of it and for instance if

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
the numerology of it and for instance if
you<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.590> 11:11<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> multiply<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.270> by<00:02:00.420> 11

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you get 11:11 and you multiply it by 11

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
you get 11:11 and you multiply it by 11
11<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> number<00:02:01.770> 1<00:02:01.979> 2<00:02:02.159> 3<00:02:02.369> 4<00:02:02.700> 3<00:02:03.000> 2<00:02:03.090> 1

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
11 you get the number 1 2 3 4 3 2 1

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.950 
11 you get the number 1 2 3 4 3 2 1
which<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> pyramid<00:02:04.820> ok<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.180> you've<00:02:06.570> got<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
which is a pyramid ok so you've got a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.190 
which is a pyramid ok so you've got a
perm<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> numerology<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.459> out

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
perm in numerology that you can get out

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.119 
perm in numerology that you can get out
backtrack<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.709> bit<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.039> take

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
backtrack on that a little bit and take

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.840 
backtrack on that a little bit and take
a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.520> slower<00:02:11.819> for

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
a little bit slower for

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
a little bit slower for
okay<00:02:13.150> yeah<00:02:13.450> okay<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.400> time

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
okay yeah okay well if you got the time

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.000 
okay yeah okay well if you got the time
code<00:02:15.850> 1111<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.260> multiply<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.710> by<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
code 1111 and you multiply it by the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.160 
code 1111 and you multiply it by the
same<00:02:18.430> thing<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.940> eleven<00:02:19.390> eleven<00:02:19.720> times<00:02:20.020> eleven

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
same thing so eleven eleven times eleven

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.590 
same thing so eleven eleven times eleven
eleven<00:02:20.740> I'm<00:02:21.160> giving<00:02:21.400> them<00:02:21.490> one<00:02:22.030> two<00:02:22.270> three

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
eleven I'm giving them one two three

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.510 
eleven I'm giving them one two three
four<00:02:22.990> three<00:02:23.860> two<00:02:24.100> one

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
four three two one

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.580 
four three two one
okay<00:02:24.880> yeah<00:02:25.210> yeah<00:02:25.480> margin<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.050> as<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> visual

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
okay yeah yeah margin that as a visual

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.520 
okay yeah yeah margin that as a visual
you've<00:02:26.770> got<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> pyramid<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.690> one<00:02:29.020> step<00:02:29.320> us

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
you've got a pyramid so what one step us

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.680 
you've got a pyramid so what one step us
up<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.160> number<00:02:30.490> one<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.210> we<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.390> two

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
up that's number one then we have two

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.630 
up that's number one then we have two
that's<00:02:31.960> two<00:02:32.260> steps<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:32.740> its<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.400> what<00:02:33.520> you're

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that's two steps up its up what you're

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.860 
that's two steps up its up what you're
going<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.300> yeah<00:02:34.510> yeah<00:02:34.690> it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
going out here yeah yeah it's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.690 
going out here yeah yeah it's
essentially<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.560> you've<00:02:36.100> got<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.460> two

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
essentially like you've got the one two

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.610 
essentially like you've got the one two
three<00:02:37.000> four<00:02:37.270> three<00:02:37.600> two<00:02:37.720> one<00:02:38.170> if<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.470> would

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
three four three two one if you would

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.830 
three four three two one if you would
plot<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.070> on<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.280> graph<00:02:39.520> right<00:02:39.790> onyx<00:02:40.720> in

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
plot that on the graph right onyx in

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.720 
plot that on the graph right onyx in
awhile<00:02:40.930> you'd<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.470> pyramid<00:02:41.860> interest

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
awhile you'd have a pyramid interest

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.930 
awhile you'd have a pyramid interest
instead<00:02:43.020> see<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.980> same<00:02:45.160> two<00:02:45.310> crazy<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.880> if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
instead see it same two crazy so if

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.050 
instead see it same two crazy so if
you've<00:02:46.060> got<00:02:46.180> 111<00:02:46.960> new<00:02:47.170> times<00:02:47.410> by<00:02:47.620> 111<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.880> get

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you've got 111 new times by 111 you get

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.970 
you've got 111 new times by 111 you get
one<00:02:49.270> two<00:02:49.450> three<00:02:49.750> two<00:02:49.990> one<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.440> get<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> pyramid

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
one two three two one you get a pyramid

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.110 
one two three two one you get a pyramid
whichever<00:02:51.340> way<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.550> look<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.880> anything

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
whichever way you look at it anything

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.330 
whichever way you look at it anything
with<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.420> base<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:52.990> interesting<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.130> so

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
with a base of one interesting and so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.600 
with a base of one interesting and so
then<00:02:54.520> if<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.270> look<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.810> 11<00:02:56.080> itself<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.770> in

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
then if you look at the 11 itself and in

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.170 
then if you look at the 11 itself and in
binary<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.530> 11<00:02:59.530> stands<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.100> three<00:03:00.400> so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
binary and 11 stands for three so

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.610 
binary and 11 stands for three so
obviously<00:03:01.450> you've<00:03:01.600> got<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.720> Trinity<00:03:02.200> out<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.440> it

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
obviously you've got a Trinity out of it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.460 
obviously you've got a Trinity out of it
mmm<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:04.090> know<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.240> mean<00:03:04.420> Sir<00:03:04.690> Hugh<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.140> convert

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
mmm you know I mean Sir Hugh to convert

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.120 
mmm you know I mean Sir Hugh to convert
to<00:03:05.620> binary

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
to binary

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
to binary
it<00:03:06.370> would<00:03:06.580> mean<00:03:06.730> it'd<00:03:07.060> be<00:03:07.330> three<00:03:07.540> so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
it would mean it'd be three so

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.740 
it would mean it'd be three so
essentially<00:03:08.740> then<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.310> look<00:03:09.460> at<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
essentially then if you look at this

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.230 
essentially then if you look at this
idea<00:03:10.960> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.380> Trinity<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:13.120> know

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
idea of the Trinity with it you know

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.040 
idea of the Trinity with it you know
33rd<00:03:13.930> degree<00:03:14.020> Mason<00:03:14.200> won't<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:16.030> 30<00:03:16.270> 30<00:03:16.540> 33

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
33rd degree Mason won't be the 30 30 33

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.750 
33rd degree Mason won't be the 30 30 33
that<00:03:17.320> goes<00:03:17.410> around<00:03:17.530> obviously<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.520> turn

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
that goes around obviously if you turn

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.910 
that goes around obviously if you turn
that<00:03:18.790> into<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.270> Trinity<00:03:19.600> need<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.230> write<00:03:20.410> 33

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
that into the Trinity need to write 33

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.160 
that into the Trinity need to write 33
by<00:03:21.100> 3<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.550> get<00:03:21.670> 11<00:03:21.990> hmm<00:03:23.520> that's<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:25.030> yes<00:03:25.780> you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
by 3 you get 11 hmm that's it yes you

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.410 
by 3 you get 11 hmm that's it yes you
start<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.830> seeing<00:03:27.130> these<00:03:27.340> pigs<00:03:27.880> 11<00:03:28.210> times

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
start like seeing these pigs 11 times

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.510 
start like seeing these pigs 11 times
I'm<00:03:28.540> saying<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.260> then<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.470> move<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.920> recent

which was a transition of the ages kind
of<00:04:34.900> period<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.560> which<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:36.280> know<00:04:36.850> basically

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
of period in which you know basically

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.260 
of period in which you know basically
world<00:04:37.870> disasters<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.910> tension<00:04:39.910> would<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.060> on

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
world disasters and tension would be on

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.300 
world disasters and tension would be on
the<00:04:40.420> up<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.660> rise<00:04:40.870> constantly<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.710> this

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
the up and rise constantly and this

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.780 
the up and rise constantly and this
period<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.670> no<00:04:43.180> time<00:04:43.420> was<00:04:43.600> 1992<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.980> 2012<00:04:45.400> and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.220 
period of no time was 1992 to 2012 and
so<00:04:46.000> 9/11<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.980> September<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.370> 11th<00:04:48.670> 2001<00:04:49.240> was

so 9/11 in September the 11th 2001 was

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.710 
so 9/11 in September the 11th 2001 was
nine<00:04:50.560> years<00:04:50.710> from<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.040> start<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.400> no<00:04:51.550> time<00:04:51.850> 11

years till the end of no time mm-hmm

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.880 
years till the end of no time mm-hmm
think<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.630> know<00:04:55.750> synchronistically<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.770> was

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
think you know synchronistically it was

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.980 
think you know synchronistically it was
placed<00:04:57.220> bang<00:04:57.610> on<00:04:57.820> we're<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.480> know<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.750> should

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
placed bang on we're you know it should

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.260
