00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.170
 audience 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.880
 rising star peeling posthumus is one of them 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 those ambitious DJs 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240

 parts for music as I also have 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 otherwise, of course, you just have to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 be very motivated to play music 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.329
 to make 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
 I do not really shady yourself 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 casting horn I do it myself 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 just like it in our least youth 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.520

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 pelle is already busy with a new one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.160
 No. He would have been for me what 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.210
 to show is what you are doing 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.210
 this is in telephone number 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.210
 and then again 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.829
 now say it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 then indicate that maxim come 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 for the lord 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.299
 and then your records will be released 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.950
 what does something like that mean to you? 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.600
 do you get a booking and or a 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.610
 sign turned on the radio 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.130
 yes they just worry we are just whole 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 large network and are sending themselves 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.619
 but in just a week to too 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.560
 would be different labels 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.140
 for example, collaborate and chon houses 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.789
 and all that moulting season is fat 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 for example then 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.649
 space that is on the radio or somewhere else 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.460
 and that becomes then I then get one 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.960
 little money for it is fun 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.789
 predicted the new number of peeling 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.590
 in this much good 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.580
