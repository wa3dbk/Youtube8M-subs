00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:10.090
 hello kids here alfredo dÃ­az and today you 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.710
 I wanted to teach a tutorial about the cube 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.800
 from rubik 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:22.280
 in which I will show you how to take the cube 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 to be able to do it faster and for you 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:34.320
 to be able to use it faster and that's worth 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 with the curved thumbs here I 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.470
 then and with the color ones 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 so the cube would be taken 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 yes 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.710
 then now what we would have for 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.710
 that and to learn how to make it easier 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 A) Yes 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 consume doing so with the two with the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.210
 from below also 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210
 OK 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.120
 and good I'll show you an algorithm 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 for 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.850
 to recite and learn to do 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.740
 faster movements it's about 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 four movements that if we do them 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.090
 six times when the juice is done 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.810
 Of course, we do six times the course 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.350
 reassemble vale then it would be 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 up left down right right so a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.560
 Having thus serves private test left 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.190
 for down right two up arrives 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 down right three up you have down 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 right four top left down 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.450
 right five top left down 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.530
 right and six times and as a product 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.990
 It is completely rich 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.360
 and you will have to do it well enough 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.360
 times for each time make it faster to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.140
 I get it as fast as others but 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140
 good more or less 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 It's also because the juice is not very 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.430
 good and it moves worse and that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.540
 so that's why I recommend a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 diane that is the one that I am going to buy I do not 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.709
 well my next tutorial 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.010
 I will teach you how to assemble the cube as 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.230
 we have to lubricate and that 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.230
 Well, goodbye suns
