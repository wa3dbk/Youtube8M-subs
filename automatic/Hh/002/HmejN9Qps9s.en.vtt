00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
and vertical lines and I'm trying to get
them<00:00:46.949> evenly<00:00:47.400> spaced<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.390> sometimes<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
them evenly spaced but sometimes it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.310

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
then you wrap this circle into a cone

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.430 
then you wrap this circle into a cone
shape<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.940> give<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.390> bit<00:01:40.780> more<00:01:40.990> support

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
pressing it into the cone and that just

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.260 
pressing it into the cone and that just
makes<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.450> more<00:01:46.630> sturdy<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.970> you're<00:01:49.150> going

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
makes it more sturdy then you're going

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
to want to bake this for about 15

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.690 
to want to bake this for about 15
minutes<00:01:51.640> at<00:01:51.790> 275<00:01:52.690> degrees

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.680 

next<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.030> need<00:01:57.120> some<00:01:57.390> liquid

next you're going to need some liquid

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.630 
next you're going to need some liquid
clay<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.410> can<00:01:58.560> place<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.800> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.400> cone

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
clay and you can place that in the cone

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
clay and you can place that in the cone
and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.120> take<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> ball<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.810> white<00:02:00.990> clay<00:02:01.350> and

just kind of squish that on top of the
cone

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.210 

then<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.790> use<00:02:13.940> sandpaper<00:02:14.480> or<00:02:14.830> any<00:02:15.830> sort
