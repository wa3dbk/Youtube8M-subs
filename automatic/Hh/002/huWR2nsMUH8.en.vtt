00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
hello this is just a little setup i toss

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.230 
hello this is just a little setup i toss
together<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.880> rostra<00:00:06.480> pie<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.050> the

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
together with the rostra pie and the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.120 
together with the rostra pie and the
x100<00:00:09.240> expansion<00:00:09.720> board<00:00:09.930> from<00:00:10.230> sub<00:00:10.500> Tronics<00:00:10.890> i

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
x100 expansion board from sub Tronics i

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.660 
x100 expansion board from sub Tronics i
did<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.269> some<00:00:12.870> issues<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.670> getting

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
did have some issues with the getting

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.179 
did have some issues with the getting
the<00:00:15.349> rs-232<00:00:17.480> output<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.599> work<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.259> i<00:00:19.739> spent<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the rs-232 output to work and i spent a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.139 
the rs-232 output to work and i spent a
very<00:00:20.849> good<00:00:21.599> couple<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.230> hours<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:23.069> that<00:00:23.310> until

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
very good couple of hours on that until

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.149 
very good couple of hours on that until
i<00:00:24.210> did<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.960> measurement<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.589> realize<00:00:25.919> that

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:26.159 
i did the measurement and realize that

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.649 
i did the measurement and realize that
they<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> pin<00:00:26.999> out<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.329> it<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:27.659 
they up the pin out on it and

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.170 
they up the pin out on it and
they<00:00:28.499> flip<00:00:28.829> the<00:00:29.039> RX<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.579> TX<00:00:29.609> lines<00:00:32.180> backward

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
they flip the RX and TX lines backward

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840 
they flip the RX and TX lines backward
so<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> straight<00:00:35.250> cable<00:00:35.520> instead

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so how to use a straight cable instead

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.050 
so how to use a straight cable instead
of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.030> null<00:00:36.210> modem<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.220> so

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
of a null modem but that's all good so

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.500 
of a null modem but that's all good so
get<00:00:39.390> power<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.070> network<00:00:41.670> get

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
get power in and then we got network get

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
get power in and then we got network get
a<00:00:42.540> serial<00:00:43.080> terminal<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:44.660> let's<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
a serial terminal here let's see you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.780 
a serial terminal here let's see you
know<00:00:46.050> power<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.740> here<00:00:46.920> running<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.460> my

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
know power it on here running from my

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.830 
know power it on here running from my
modified<00:00:48.330> ATX<00:00:48.960> power<00:00:49.140> supply<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:51.690> got<00:00:51.810> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
modified ATX power supply and it's got a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.380 
modified ATX power supply and it's got a
boot<00:00:52.050> raspbian<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.400> get<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:53.850> random

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
boot raspbian I'm gonna get some random

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
boot raspbian I'm gonna get some random
crap<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.900> the<00:00:54.960> beginning<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
crap in the beginning and then it's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.800 
crap in the beginning and then it's
going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> start<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.130> boot<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.660> why

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
going to start to boot I don't know why

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.770 
going to start to boot I don't know why
it<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.110> that<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.980> read<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
the hdmi to vga converter it's actually

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.230 
the hdmi to vga converter it's actually
pretty<00:01:24.659> cold<00:01:24.929> right<00:01:25.109> now<00:01:25.139> because<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.829> used

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and the USB controller and the dc-dc

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.940 
and the USB controller and the dc-dc
converter<00:01:33.840> ship<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.229> were<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.499> really

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
converter ship they were only really

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.789 
converter ship they were only really
really<00:01:35.459> hot<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.479> made<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.959> couple<00:01:37.709> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
really hot so i made a couple of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.080 
really hot so i made a couple of
little<00:01:38.009> heat<00:01:38.189> sinks<00:01:38.459> and<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.819> on<00:01:38.909> there

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
little heat sinks and put them on there

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.870 
little heat sinks and put them on there
that's<00:01:39.719> all<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:39.899> nice<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:43.189> overall<00:01:44.189> after

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that's all very nice and overall after

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.599 
that's all very nice and overall after
been<00:01:45.299> using<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.810> board<00:01:46.109> a<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
been using this board a bit it's really

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.480 
been using this board a bit it's really
really<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:49.170> awesome<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.829> mean

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
really really awesome I mean

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.940 
really really awesome I mean
it's<00:01:50.819> sad<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.179> it<00:01:51.479> costs<00:01:51.869> almost<00:01:52.079> 40<00:01:52.740> bucks

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's sad that it costs almost 40 bucks

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
it's sad that it costs almost 40 bucks
but<00:01:53.249> it's<00:01:53.549> totally<00:01:53.729> worth<00:01:54.029> it<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.810> me<00:01:54.840> because

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
but it's totally worth it for me because

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
but it's totally worth it for me because
this<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.159> makes<00:01:56.399> everything<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.090> much

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
this just makes everything so much

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.149 
this just makes everything so much
easier<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.039> part<00:01:59.039> from<00:01:59.279> the<00:02:00.079> rs232<00:02:01.079> pan<00:02:01.950> out

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
easier and part from the rs232 pan out

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
easier and part from the rs232 pan out
being<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.819> wonky<00:02:03.229> it's<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.439> good<00:02:04.469> I'm

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
being a little wonky it's so good I'm

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.900 
being a little wonky it's so good I'm
gonna<00:02:05.639> log<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.119> here

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910

so<00:02:12.910> you're<00:02:13.360> booted<00:02:13.720> into<00:02:13.840> raspbian<00:02:14.440> we're

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so you're booted into raspbian we're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.960 
so you're booted into raspbian we're
going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.820> start<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.180> IRC<00:02:16.690> here<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.760> actually

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
going to start up IRC here I'm actually

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.090 
going to start up IRC here I'm actually
going<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.390> put<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.750> camera<00:02:23.290> down<00:02:23.320> for<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> bit

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
going to put the camera down for a bit

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.950 
going to put the camera down for a bit
and<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.640> look<00:02:24.820> at<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:27.240> blurry<00:02:30.630> very<00:02:31.630> blurry

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
