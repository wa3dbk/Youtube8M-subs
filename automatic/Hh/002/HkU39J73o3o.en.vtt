 [Music] 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 Only this is what keeps everyone alive today 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.910
 friend the feeling is something new 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.400
 the first wash is on good friends 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 and the second bottle will not work 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.630
 repent because people limit to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.210
 inserts the next evening 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.480
 real time and four days forget what we 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.280
 for estonia to translate back to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.640
 are up and down and long ago 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.210
 because today nobody on each and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 Everyone thought that in the pitch black 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.090
 city ​​our island of happiness and us 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.360
 see also in the last open point 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.030
 need over time 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.190
 to apply directly to life are like that 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.630
 Nobody makes us anything 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:45.390
 no matter if she or he is my friend 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:45.390
 [Music] 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.800
 despite more often we are strong and no matter 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.159
 where you are going broke 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.159
 [Music] 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 yesterday as today 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.560
 Every morning it sounds a bit new 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 moment that you are mortal you are in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.090
 this could happen next moment 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.450
 but we go out of the light together 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 But the end of the tunnel is always positive 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.690
 like a dark car euro for alcohol 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.040
 you and in a circle 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.620
 it's right thinking 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.780
 goes in sight 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.450
 left has the first otherwise purely by 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.299
 right with and lead the first 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.760
 bed and drink do not we discuss 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.310
 until the end only a slip occurs 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.189
 if you are already beautiful things to stand 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.370
 that are Handel's life to make 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:03:07.790
 and I thought my god 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:03:10.310
 [Music] 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.300
 Often we are unbeatable and no matter 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.670
 as you're there goes the life 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.890
 but somehow I know how 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.020
 no one does not expect to be expected 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.570
 Keep us often we have unbeatable 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.780
 and no matter where you are but if I am 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.120
 am there is life somehow 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.020
 I know we will not both 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.300
 fail 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:46.749
 head up we find each other 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:46.749
