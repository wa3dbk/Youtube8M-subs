starting<00:02:09.039> from<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.759> lower<00:02:10.300> outer<00:02:10.780> corner<00:02:11.650> of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
starting from the lower outer corner of

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.000 
starting from the lower outer corner of
my<00:02:12.069> eye<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.850> then<00:02:13.209> I'm<00:02:13.450> sweeping<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:14.140> line<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
my eye and then I'm sweeping a line and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.420 
my eye and then I'm sweeping a line and
then<00:02:15.670> following<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.510> natural<00:02:17.020> lash<00:02:17.260> line<00:02:17.620> so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
then following my natural lash line so

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.340 
then following my natural lash line so
the<00:02:18.610> inner<00:02:18.790> corner<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.420> eye<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.750> kind<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
the inner corner of the eye is kind of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.760 
the inner corner of the eye is kind of
tricky<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.190> what<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.910> do<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.560> drag<00:02:23.560> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
tricky so what you want to do is drag it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.210 
tricky so what you want to do is drag it
out<00:02:23.950> slowly<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.209> I'm<00:02:26.110> actually<00:02:26.290> leaving<00:02:26.830> a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
out slowly and I'm actually leaving a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.490 
out slowly and I'm actually leaving a
gap<00:02:27.490> on<00:02:27.760> my<00:02:27.880> lower<00:02:28.090> lash<00:02:28.390> line<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:29.080> like<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
gap on my lower lash line just like that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.100
