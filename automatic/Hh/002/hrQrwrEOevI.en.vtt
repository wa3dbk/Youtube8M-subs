very<00:00:43.770> apprehensive<00:00:44.100> my<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.760> time<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
very apprehensive my first time going

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
very apprehensive my first time going
out<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.079> even<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.500> climbing<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> ladder

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129

out I don't even like climbing a ladder
but<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.809> helped<00:00:49.020> me<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.320> my

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
but it really helped me get over my

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
but it really helped me get over my
fears<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.730> does<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.449> more

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
fears and it does get a little bit more

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
fears and it does get a little bit more
difficult<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.320> along<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> starts

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
difficult as you go along but it starts

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.900 
difficult as you go along but it starts
off<00:00:53.190> quite<00:00:53.430> easy<00:00:53.850> okay<00:00:54.329> perfect<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
off quite easy okay perfect and so I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.130 
off quite easy okay perfect and so I
believe<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.210> there's<00:00:57.539> something<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
believe that there's something that the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
believe that there's something that the
kids<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:58.980> absolutely<00:00:59.340> yes<00:01:00.090> it's
