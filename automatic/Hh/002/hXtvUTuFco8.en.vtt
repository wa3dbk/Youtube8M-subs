Mongoose first you're going to have to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.580 
Mongoose first you're going to have to
drive<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.000> down<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.630> then<00:02:28.290> drive<00:02:28.320> it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
drive it down here and then drive it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
get a armor lock and then you're going

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.400 
get a armor lock and then you're going
to<00:02:35.940> drive<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.390> mom<00:02:36.600> use<00:02:36.840> back<00:02:37.080> through<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
to drive this mom use back through the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.930 
to drive this mom use back through the
hole<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.860> don't<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.130> stuck<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
hole so you don't get stuck in there and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.300 
hole so you don't get stuck in there and
then<00:02:39.630> blow<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:41.010> you're<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
then blow it up and then you're going to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.100 
then blow it up and then you're going to
wait<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> respawn<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.780> through<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
wait for it to respawn so through the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
wait for it to respawn so through the
magic<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> editing<00:02:43.680> whoa<00:02:44.190> BAM<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.790> has<00:02:44.970> respawn

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
magic of editing whoa BAM it has respawn

magic of editing whoa BAM it has respawn
you're<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.460> go<00:02:47.460> into<00:02:47.610> armor<00:02:47.910> lock<00:02:48.060> right

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
you're going to go into armor lock right

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're going to go into armor lock right
next<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.810> try<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.940> push<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> across<00:02:51.180> the
