you're into open water that is protected
by<00:00:28.970> mangrove<00:00:29.970> Islands<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.710> pretty<00:00:31.949> easy

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
by mangrove Islands and it's pretty easy

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
by mangrove Islands and it's pretty easy
paddling<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.000> point<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:34.050> you're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
paddling at that point if you're

paddling at that point if you're
carrying<00:00:34.469> fishing<00:00:34.739> poles<00:00:34.950> make<00:00:35.280> sure<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
carrying fishing poles make sure that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.220 
carrying fishing poles make sure that
you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> lay<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.360> poles<00:00:36.630> down<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you have a way to lay your poles down I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.920 
you have a way to lay your poles down I
carried<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.040> GPS<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> see<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.390> far<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:39.690> went

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
carried a GPS just to see how far i went

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
carried a GPS just to see how far i went
to<00:00:40.050> mark<00:00:40.260> fishing<00:00:40.590> locations<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:42.090> were

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
to mark fishing locations but there were

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.819 
to mark fishing locations but there were
a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> people<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.719> their<00:00:42.960> families<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a lot of people out their families and

a lot of people out their families and
such<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.579> certainly<00:00:45.180> weren't<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.570> GPS

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
such that certainly weren't using GPS

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
such that certainly weren't using GPS
our<00:00:46.980> couple<00:00:47.250> areas<00:00:47.399> where<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.700> gets<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.879> little

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
our couple areas where it gets a little

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.020 
our couple areas where it gets a little
bit<00:00:48.120> difficult<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:49.010> paddle<00:00:50.010> either<00:00:50.700> because

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
bit difficult to paddle either because

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
bit difficult to paddle either because
there's<00:00:51.180> mangrove<00:00:51.660> roots<00:00:51.960> growing<00:00:52.289> into<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
there's mangrove roots growing into the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
there's mangrove roots growing into the
channel<00:00:53.719> or<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.379> simply<00:00:55.559> gets<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.070> narrow

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
channel or it just simply gets so narrow

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.410 
channel or it just simply gets so narrow
that<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> narrow<00:00:58.350> than<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.739> paddle<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
that it's narrow than your paddle and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.670 
that it's narrow than your paddle and
your<00:01:00.420> paddle<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.899> tendency<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.469> caught

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
your paddle has a tendency to get caught

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
your paddle has a tendency to get caught
in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.160> mangrove<00:01:02.760> roots<00:01:03.080> allowing<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> hit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
in the mangrove roots allowing it to hit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
in the mangrove roots allowing it to hit
you<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.559> face<00:01:04.820> you'll<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> next

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you in the face you'll see in the next

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.420 
you in the face you'll see in the next
segment<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.070> put<00:01:08.159> my

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
segment here that I actually just put my

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
segment here that I actually just put my
paddle<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.470> pulled<00:01:10.470> myself<00:01:10.650> along

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
paddle down and pulled myself along

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
paddle down and pulled myself along
using<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> Cypress<00:01:12.420> roots<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> branches

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
using the Cypress roots and the branches

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
using the Cypress roots and the branches
overhead<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.270> actually<00:01:15.270> moved<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:15.900> bit

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
overhead and actually moved a little bit

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
overhead and actually moved a little bit
more<00:01:16.200> efficiently<00:01:16.590> than<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.520> able<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
more efficiently than it I was able to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
more efficiently than it I was able to
do<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.180> paddling<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:19.560> very

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
do when I was paddling in these very

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
do when I was paddling in these very
tight<00:01:20.070> areas<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.960> August<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.470> extremely<00:01:22.950> hot

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
tight areas in August is extremely hot

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
tight areas in August is extremely hot
it's<00:01:23.939> nice<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> mangroves<00:01:25.020> but

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's nice to get in the mangroves but

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's nice to get in the mangroves but
once<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.439> get<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> mangroves<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
once you get out of the mangroves it

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
once you get out of the mangroves it
becomes<00:01:27.710> quite<00:01:28.710> hot<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.670> humid<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> certainly

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
becomes quite hot and humid so certainly

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660 
becomes quite hot and humid so certainly
