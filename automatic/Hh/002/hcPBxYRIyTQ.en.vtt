00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.510

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.760
 they had some chinacos but if you look 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.059
 the deputies and deputies that are 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.530
 to the people who meet the needs 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 in your diary the marriage that is no longer 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.469
 gay marriage is equal marriage 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 for times between people we are 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.449
 we like you have to use this type of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.280
 words to understand what is it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 what happens we lock ourselves in a world 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.210
 home I have my bed like every day 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.520
 when in reality there are people who 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 literally lives from the cock like 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.550

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 on tragedy 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.690
 on human rights and equity 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 social and in order is net that in this 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 period of the people that we chose that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 they will rule us they do not have in their 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.120
 calendar something of social equity a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.760
 right as basic as marriage 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.710
 that that is something that does not matter they continue to 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.690
 your mother we do taxes we fulfill 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 our duty as citizens we are a 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.800
 economic engine we leave them wool 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.010
 they steal that father we are still 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 persecuted extorted and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.910
 discriminated by the authorities and that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.700
 that in the constitution says clearly 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.530
 that you can not so tell me friend 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.260
 regiomontan from any other state and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.300
 it feels to have all your obligations and 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.770
 have the rights many you follow 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.840
 thinking that those who make this sit-down 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.580
 they are ridiculous, excuse me chingos 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 but I know those ridiculous are 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.630
 ridiculous studied they know and that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.740
 they have not worked for many years 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 more for the rights of the collective 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.050
 lesbian gay bisexual transsexual and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.080
 transgender are basic rights of 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.070
 equity that includes all women 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.960
 indigenous disabled children all not 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.600
 come to me with mom 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.870
 and ridiculous because they at least are 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.710
 trying to make a change in these 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.710
 doing that not doing dirty 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.710

 with those horrible people who think that in 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.570
 the marches the seedlings and these things 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.030
 they are white I know and I understand that sometimes 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.190
 be able to be a bit exasperating but it's 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 the point of exerting social pressure of 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.850
 I remember you do not need to be gay to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.570
 support this type of initiatives there 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.570
