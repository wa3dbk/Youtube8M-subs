 in all 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.130
 casey embedded timeline 85 71 is a laptop 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.200
 for business responding with strict 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.750
 light weight design 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.710
 for the model of this class the most important 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.680
 parameter is speed and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.350
 enough autonomy which 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.550
 users would allow 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.990
 platform regarding work 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.699
 the road 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.230
 P 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.429
 in the article 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.009
 this is what we caught 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.349
 complete with all items 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.859
 necessary for active 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.749
 use in the box except the very 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.219
 laptop user will find 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.199
 compact charger 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.949
 high capacity battery 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.120
 documentation software discs 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.280
 security and numbers as well 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.229
 partly SOCKER this modification 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.420
 comes with an operating 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 windows vista business system that fully 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 corresponds to its positioning 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.540
 and so 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.940
 suffered but timeline 85 71 refers to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.090
 corporate segment 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.140
 laptops and it immediately leads 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.740
 loans model is made in strict 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.500
 black case which is different 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.379
 straight lines and lack of closure

 child support all surface has 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.070
 matte finish it made the case more 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.009
 practical and durable in contrast 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.780
 from glossy laptops on panels 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.320
 which often remain not only 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 fingerprints but minor scratches 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 even with careful operation of the screen 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.330
 supports 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.030
 two massive hinges that don't 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.210
 give the laptop to open completely 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.430
 but at the same time reliably fixes the position 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.120
 even during 5 discounts work in the car 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.300

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 it allows you to use it 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.430
 trips and even despite 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.840
 fairly large standard sizes 6 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.800
 cell battery has a capacity of 5 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.260
 and hours in front of them hours of what's on the results 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.520
 testing credits to 2005 prof 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 enough to ensure more

 seven and a half hours autonomous 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.340

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.469
 This is a truly outstanding result.

 supplemented by a block of digital buttons 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.150
 the keys are made quite large that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.860

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.789
 and so 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.349
 to ensure a long time

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.279
 similar models but the price difference is quite 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.439
 justified by long autonomy and
