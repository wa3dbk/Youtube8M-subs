00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the lumber business so that we can take

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720 
the lumber business so that we can take
these<00:02:58.959> trees<00:02:59.379> that<00:03:00.040> are<00:03:00.159> growing<00:03:00.400> and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
these trees that are growing and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.140 
these trees that are growing and
value-add<00:03:01.659> them<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> thousand<00:03:02.739> percent

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
value-add them a thousand percent

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.449 
value-add them a thousand percent
suddenly<00:03:04.150> we<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.200> value<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:05.980> forest

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
suddenly we have value in the forest

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.030 
suddenly we have value in the forest
suddenly<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.389> forest<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.959> worth<00:03:08.349> stewarding

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
suddenly the forest is worth stewarding

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.909 
suddenly the forest is worth stewarding
see<00:03:09.879> that's<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.419> point<00:03:10.689> here<00:03:10.930> our<00:03:11.260> county<00:03:11.799> is

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
see that's the point here our county is

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.220 
see that's the point here our county is
building<00:03:12.250> eight<00:03:12.459> hundred<00:03:12.939> houses<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.419> year<00:03:13.840> not

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
building eight hundred houses a year not

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.559 
building eight hundred houses a year not
two<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.560> them<00:03:14.859> uses<00:03:15.250> lumber<00:03:15.639> this<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.359> that's

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
two of them uses lumber this that that's

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.539 
two of them uses lumber this that that's
cut<00:03:16.870> within<00:03:17.260> two<00:03:17.590> thousand<00:03:18.069> miles<00:03:18.219> of<00:03:18.459> our

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
cut within two thousand miles of our

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.420 
cut within two thousand miles of our
county<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.409> farmers<00:03:20.859> just<00:03:21.040> view<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
county and so the farmers just view the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.220 
county and so the farmers just view the
trees<00:03:21.730> as<00:03:22.030> something<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.629> gets<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.109> way

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
of the cows or the hay bond so they

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.119 
of the cows or the hay bond so they
destroy<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.840> woods<00:03:26.049> nobody<00:03:26.590> takes<00:03:26.799> care<00:03:26.889> of

the<00:03:29.200> diseased<00:03:29.500> trees<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.730> NI<00:03:31.030> PF<00:03:31.480> land

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the diseased trees and so the NI PF land

the local resource base suddenly we've

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.629 
the local resource base suddenly we've

all<00:05:08.770> sleeping<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.699> so<00:05:10.539> they<00:05:10.660> don't<00:05:10.840> want<00:05:11.020> to

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
all sleeping and so they don't want to

all sleeping and so they don't want to
eat<00:05:11.229> at<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:11.710> point<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:12.550> what<00:05:12.669> we<00:05:12.759> want<00:05:12.940> to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
eat at that point and so what we want to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.870 
eat at that point and so what we want to
do<00:05:13.210> is<00:05:13.509> is<00:05:14.050> have<00:05:14.319> a<00:05:14.590> carbonaceous<00:05:15.310> diaper

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
do is is have a carbonaceous diaper

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.770 
do is is have a carbonaceous diaper
under<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.630> volatile<00:05:17.349> nutrient<00:05:17.919> load<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:19.330> to

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
under that volatile nutrient load to to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.890 
under that volatile nutrient load to to
Pat<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.740> up<00:05:20.889> 50<00:05:21.699> pounds<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.120> day<00:05:22.150> per<00:05:22.509> cow<00:05:22.690> that's

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
Pat it up 50 pounds a day per cow that's

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.879 
Pat it up 50 pounds a day per cow that's
that's<00:05:23.259> big<00:05:23.470> diaper<00:05:23.710> all<00:05:24.400> right<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.680> that

that's big diaper all right and so that
so<00:05:27.069> the<00:05:27.220> cows<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.460> can<00:05:27.789> see<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.000> bedding

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
so the cows you can see the bedding

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.700 
so the cows you can see the bedding
building<00:05:28.630> up<00:05:28.690> there<00:05:28.840> where<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.080> cows<00:05:29.259> are<00:05:29.470> the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
building up there where the cows are the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.170 
building up there where the cows are the
hay<00:05:29.830> stack<00:05:29.889> here<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.550> just<00:05:30.699> put<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.060> down

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
hay stack here you just put it down

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.499 
hay stack here you just put it down
there

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
there

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.210 
there
and<00:05:31.659> then<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.139> walk<00:05:32.319> home<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.830> read<00:05:33.009> your

and then you walk home and you read your

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.309 
and then you walk home and you read your

it doesn't make the front page of the
