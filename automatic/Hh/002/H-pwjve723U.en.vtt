here so I was hoping you could help me
out<00:00:07.460> we're<00:00:08.460> looking<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.290> front

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
out we're looking at the front

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.120 
out we're looking at the front
derailleur<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.639> bike<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.679> I'm

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
derailleur of my bike here and I'm

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.560 
derailleur of my bike here and I'm
having<00:00:14.280> difficulty<00:00:14.759> setting<00:00:15.210> up<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
having difficulty setting up the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
having difficulty setting up the
derailleur<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.440> doesn't<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.010> goes<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.550> all

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
derailleur so it doesn't it goes to all

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.330 
derailleur so it doesn't it goes to all
three<00:00:17.910> gears<00:00:18.150> basically<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.800> I've<00:00:19.920> set<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> up

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
three gears basically so I've set it up

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.849 
three gears basically so I've set it up
right<00:00:20.520> now<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> lowest<00:00:21.900> gear<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
right now it's in the lowest gear the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.160 
right now it's in the lowest gear the
one<00:00:22.980> towards<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.539> right<00:00:24.539> guess<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> smallest

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one towards the right guess the smallest

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.240 
one towards the right guess the smallest
I<00:00:25.289> don't<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.529> its<00:00:25.680> lowest<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> highest

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
I don't know if its lowest to highest

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670 
I don't know if its lowest to highest
but<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> smallest<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:28.199> closest<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
but it's the smallest it's closest to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.639 
but it's the smallest it's closest to
the<00:00:28.859> frame<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.769> there's<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.420> good

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
the frame you can see there's a good

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
the frame you can see there's a good
decent<00:00:34.649> size<00:00:34.950> captain<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.550> really<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.980> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
decent size captain not really but it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
decent size captain not really but it
doesn't<00:00:38.879> hit<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> doesn't<00:00:39.930> hit<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> day<00:00:40.350> rip

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
doesn't hit the doesn't hit the day rip

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.220 
doesn't hit the doesn't hit the day rip
derailleur<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:42.360> got<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> set<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
derailleur and I've got it set it up so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
derailleur and I've got it set it up so
the<00:00:43.379> cable<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.120> lose

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the cable here you know it's not lose

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
the cable here you know it's not lose
but<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.410> tight<00:00:49.410> enough<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.710> it'll

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
but it's it's a tight enough that it'll

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
but it's it's a tight enough that it'll
change<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> Edit<00:00:51.480> gears<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:57.770> don't<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
change the Edit gears so I don't want to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.979 
change the Edit gears so I don't want to
cover<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> microphone<00:01:00.329> i<00:01:00.359> did<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.809> last

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
cover the microphone i did that my last

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.429 
cover the microphone i did that my last
video<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:01.500> couldn't<00:01:01.800> hear<00:01:01.920> anything<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.439> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
video and i couldn't hear anything so so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.270 
video and i couldn't hear anything so so
I<00:01:04.830> close<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> second<00:01:05.760> gear<00:01:05.970> great<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I close to the second gear great and the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.940 
I close to the second gear great and the
problem<00:01:11.210> try<00:01:12.210> third<00:01:12.540> year<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> goes

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
problem try third year here and it goes

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910 
problem try third year here and it goes
in<00:01:17.100> third<00:01:17.310> gear<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:19.470> hear<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
in third gear but you can also hear that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
in third gear but you can also hear that
scraping<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.670> sweeps<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
scraping it sweeps a little bit on the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.429 
scraping it sweeps a little bit on the
side<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.740> every<00:01:23.159> once<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> while<00:01:24.439> not

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
side here every once in a while not

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
side here every once in a while not
thrilled<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.700> that's<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.299> really

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
thrilled with that but that's not really

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.100 
thrilled with that but that's not really
even<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> main<00:01:28.350> problem<00:01:28.710> main<00:01:29.700> problem<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
even the main problem main problem is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
even the main problem main problem is
that<00:01:32.040> once<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:34.790> put<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> back<00:01:36.180> down<00:01:36.600> into<00:01:38.180> low

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that once I put it back down into low

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.249 
that once I put it back down into low
gear<00:01:39.240> you'll<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> big<00:01:40.500> button<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.009> more

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
gear you'll see the big button here more

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.840 
gear you'll see the big button here more
yeah<00:01:43.640> um<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:47.220> doesn't<00:01:47.280> even<00:01:47.579> go

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
yeah um it doesn't it doesn't even go

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.789 
yeah um it doesn't it doesn't even go
doesn't<00:01:49.630> push<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.900> over<00:01:50.080> far<00:01:50.320> enough<00:01:50.350> to

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
doesn't push it over far enough to

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.950 
doesn't push it over far enough to
switch<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.520> lowest<00:01:51.880> gear<00:01:52.090> there<00:01:52.299> see

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
switch to that lowest gear there see

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.649 
switch to that lowest gear there see
there's<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:56.470> here's<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.159> gear

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
there's the you can see here's the gear

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's the you can see here's the gear
right<00:01:58.659> down<00:01:58.810> here<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.210> chain<00:02:01.540> just<00:02:01.720> won't

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
right down here and the chain just won't

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.289 
right down here and the chain just won't
go<00:02:02.399> keep<00:02:03.399> pushing<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:06.820> not<00:02:07.000> exactly

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
go keep pushing it so I'm not exactly

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.359 
go keep pushing it so I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:07.690> what<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> problem<00:02:08.319> is<00:02:08.619> I've<00:02:09.100> adjusted

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
sure what the problem is I've adjusted

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.140 
sure what the problem is I've adjusted
this<00:02:09.910> low<00:02:10.360> screw<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.800> when<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.100> when<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
this low screw so that when it when this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.090 
this low screw so that when it when this
derailleur<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.319> position<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.920> the

derailleur is in this position in the
chain<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.520> actually<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> lowest<00:02:16.989> gear

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
chain is actually on the lowest gear

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
chain is actually on the lowest gear
that<00:02:18.040> there's<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> good<00:02:18.550> enough<00:02:18.970> gap<00:02:19.239> between

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that there's a good enough gap between

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.350 
that there's a good enough gap between
the<00:02:19.780> derailleur<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.650> derailleur<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.459> the

the derailleur this derailleur and the
chain<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.840> doesn't<00:02:23.290> hit<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> chain<00:02:24.190> but

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
chain that doesn't hit this chain but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170 
chain that doesn't hit this chain but
when<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> try<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.380> from<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.130> medium<00:02:27.910> gear

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
when I try to go from this medium gear
