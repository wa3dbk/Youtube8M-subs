00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.700
 good dear 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.700

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.080
 chancellors 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 and we established despite the difference 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.970
 of political projects 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.000
 and from the visions we established a good 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 and deep friendship that we have continued 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200
 now as president 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.160

 Heads and Heads of State and Government 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.010
 We are without a doubt in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.270
 history times 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.470
 but not from any story 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.480
 in times of a new history 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.690
 that sometimes for being protagonists and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 be in the eye of the hurricane in our 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 respective countries 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.020
 we may not be able to assess in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.210
 all its magnitude 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.670

 Panama 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.400
 and then I visited 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.040

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.960

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.969
 where our grandparents were 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 summoned by the liberator Simon 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 bolivar 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.950
 visualized first as a dream 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 visualized as a dream 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.210
 in the letter of jamaica 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.020
 just in 1815 president 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 a loving greeting to the prime minister 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.349
 by itself has been his great friend of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.330
 venezuela will give bolivariana soon 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.910

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.930
 petrocaribe 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.079
 companions in september 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.299
 commemorating 200 years of the letter of 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.780
 jamaica hopefully they could accompany us 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.630
 some heads of government and state 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.630
 because it really is very important 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.460
 Bolivar at that time was defeated 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.760
 only the address we could call it 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.050
 in modern terms 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 dear president raúl castro 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.880
 the military political leadership of the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.700
 independence struggle was 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.750
 fractionated divided they did not know 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.580
 Bolivar as boss and came to Jamaica 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.210
 saving his life miraculously and then 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.960
 was Haitian to receive the loving hug and 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.040
 salvador david sanders petión liberator 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.140
 from haiti 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.160
 the great Haitian of the republic of the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.160
 Black Jacobins 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.190
 and defeated bolivar writes the famous 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.700
 letter from jamaica 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.250
 almost like a prophet but a prophet of 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.910
 faith and commitment 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.700
 then he had to travel the years 16-17 and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.700
 he found the way to victory and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.860
 then he had to find and direct 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.960
 personally 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.410
 a gigantic epic 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.270
 lament of our president obama that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.260
 here respect even though you have 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.260
 threatened my homeland 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.069
 because for us the story is not 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.189
 past testimonies 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.650
 hidden and dead for us in the 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.840
 history a living force 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.299
 and we talk about the story because we're 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.760
 proud of our history of which 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.790
 they built the liberators in which 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.549
 we are building today we do not have a 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.250
 dark story of which to repent 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.220
 because we have never bombed and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.750
 murdered peoples brothers in no 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.410
 Place of the world 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.410
 because
