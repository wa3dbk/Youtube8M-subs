you're<00:02:33.270> not<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.450> fan<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.050> actually<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
you're not a fan but I actually think I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.860

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
hurt or a read an interview where you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.930 
hurt or a read an interview where you
said<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.250> crossover

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
said you really don't like crossover

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.900 
said you really don't like crossover
that's<00:02:39.450> okay<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.890> no<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that's okay but no because it's the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.820 
that's okay but no because it's the
whole<00:02:42.060> sort<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.510> fusion<00:02:42.780> thing<00:02:43.200> yes<00:02:43.560> because

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
whole sort of fusion thing yes because

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.070 
whole sort of fusion thing yes because
fusion<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.209> fusion<00:02:45.570> restaurants

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
fusion like just like fusion restaurants

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.720 
fusion like just like fusion restaurants
it<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.410> amazing<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.519> be

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
it can be amazing and then it can be

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.520 
it can be amazing and then it can be
really<00:02:47.880> lousy<00:02:48.180> hit<00:02:48.660> or<00:02:48.780> miss<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.320> it's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
really lousy hit or miss you know it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.660 
really lousy hit or miss you know it's
really<00:02:49.769> hit<00:02:49.920> or<00:02:50.010> miss<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.580> with

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
really hit or miss and I think with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.220 
really hit or miss and I think with
crossover<00:02:51.090> music<00:02:51.390> especially<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.959> for

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
crossover music especially like for

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.170 
crossover music especially like for
classical<00:02:53.100> musicians<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:53.820> many<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.090> us

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
classical musicians and so many of us

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.620 
classical musicians and so many of us
are<00:02:54.300> purists<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.250> anything<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.670> either

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
are purists that anything that is either

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.410 
are purists that anything that is either
different<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.769> has<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> twist<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.970> things<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
different or has a twist on things that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.840

it's a really cool sort of groovy mix of
what<00:03:57.610> we<00:03:57.849> normally<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.360> so<00:03:58.660> for<00:03:59.290> me<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.620> was

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
what we normally do so for me it was

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.160 
what we normally do so for me it was
really<00:04:00.819> interesting<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.660> bit<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.959> risk

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
really interesting and a bit of a risk

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.350 
really interesting and a bit of a risk
to<00:04:02.319> do<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.590> but<00:04:02.860> I'm<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.280> glad<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:03.909> let's<00:04:04.150> be

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
to do this but I'm so glad so let's be

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.789 
to do this but I'm so glad so let's be
doing<00:04:04.569> something<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.959> little<00:04:04.989> bit<00:04:05.440> different

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
doing something a little bit different

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.400 
doing something a little bit different
because<00:04:05.890> I'm<00:04:06.819> never<00:04:07.390> going<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.870> sort<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.170> throw

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
because I'm never going to sort of throw

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.869 
because I'm never going to sort of throw
away<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:08.709> classical<00:04:09.099> roots<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.459> mean<00:04:09.579> it's<00:04:09.700> what

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
away my classical roots I mean it's what

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.390 
away my classical roots I mean it's what
I<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.540> Who<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.900> am<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.530> will<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.250> day

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
I do it's Who I am so I will to the day

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.809 
I do it's Who I am so I will to the day
I<00:04:12.430> die

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
I die

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.569 
I die
always<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.989> playing<00:04:14.290> Brahms<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.010> Tchaikovsky

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
always be playing Brahms and Tchaikovsky

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.189 
always be playing Brahms and Tchaikovsky
and<00:04:15.609> Mendelssohn<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.630> think<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.079> know

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
and Mendelssohn but I think you know

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.449 
and Mendelssohn but I think you know
occasionally<00:04:17.769> especially<00:04:17.949> at<00:04:18.250> my<00:04:18.430> age

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
occasionally especially at my age

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.830 
occasionally especially at my age
because<00:04:18.789> I'm<00:04:18.970> still<00:04:19.090> young<00:04:19.150> enough<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.510> do

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
because I'm still young enough to do

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.750 
because I'm still young enough to do
stuff<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.199> get<00:04:20.320> away<00:04:20.410> with<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.310> think

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
stuff and get away with it and I think

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760 
stuff and get away with it and I think
it's<00:04:22.120> okay<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.389> just<00:04:22.720> try<00:04:22.990> new<00:04:23.169> things<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.620> try

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
it's okay to just try new things and try

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.870 
it's okay to just try new things and try
new<00:04:23.800> colors<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.639> try<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.120> explore<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:25.840> know
