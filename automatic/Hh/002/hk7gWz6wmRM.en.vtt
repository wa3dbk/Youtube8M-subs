obviously you want to hold it like this
this<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.210> what<00:00:25.509> it<00:00:25.630> looks<00:00:25.779> like<00:00:25.960> when<00:00:26.169> you're

holding it you want to hold it between
your<00:00:28.540> index<00:00:29.050> finger<00:00:29.529> and<00:00:29.680> your<00:00:29.769> middle<00:00:30.279> finger

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
your index finger and your middle finger

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.939 
your index finger and your middle finger
you<00:00:31.090> want<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.330> stick<00:00:31.539> it<00:00:31.630> between<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:32.140> two<00:00:32.320> you

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
you want to stick it between the two you

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.950 
you want to stick it between the two you
want<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:33.220> hold<00:00:33.400> it<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.699> upper<00:00:34.510> left-hand

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
want to hold it in the upper left-hand

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.619 
want to hold it in the upper left-hand
corner<00:00:35.199> or<00:00:36.010> right<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:36.760> just<00:00:37.000> find<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.330> it's<00:00:37.570> a

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
corner or right I just find that it's a

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.240 
corner or right I just find that it's a
lot<00:00:37.720> more<00:00:37.750> accurate<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.530> get<00:00:38.680> more<00:00:38.860> spin

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
lot more accurate and you get more spin

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.759 
lot more accurate and you get more spin
if<00:00:39.430> it's<00:00:39.610> in<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> left<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:41.260> want<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.500> stick<00:00:41.650> it

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
if it's in the left you want to stick it

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.220 
if it's in the left you want to stick it
between<00:00:41.890> fingers<00:00:42.610> like<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:44.050> want

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
between fingers like that and you want

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.130 
between fingers like that and you want
to<00:00:44.320> keep<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.620> card<00:00:44.920> on<00:00:45.070> an<00:00:45.280> angle<00:00:45.700> so<00:00:46.390> I<00:00:46.809> don't

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
to keep the card on an angle so I don't

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.630 
to keep the card on an angle so I don't
know<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.379> just<00:00:47.410> helps<00:00:47.800> them<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.100> spin<00:00:48.370> like

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
know it just helps them to spin like

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.529 
know it just helps them to spin like
this<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.840> when<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:50.590> go<00:00:51.309> you're<00:00:52.180> going<00:00:52.390> to

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539

more options you could want to choose

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.949 
more options you could want to choose
from<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.830> show<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.509> either<00:01:28.660> go

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
from is how you show you can either go

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.230 
from is how you show you can either go
like<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.709> flick<00:01:30.399> with<00:01:30.610> your<00:01:30.759> wrist<00:01:30.970> or

you can bring up towards your shoulder

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.880 
you can bring up towards your shoulder
and<00:01:33.700> throw<00:01:34.330> straight<00:01:34.690> down<00:01:34.929> or<00:01:35.229> kind<00:01:35.619> of<00:01:35.740> like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
and throw straight down or kind of like

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.359 
and throw straight down or kind of like
this<00:01:36.340> if<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.360> throw<00:01:37.690> straight<00:01:37.990> down<00:01:38.369> usually

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
this if you throw straight down usually

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.240 
this if you throw straight down usually
the<00:01:39.550> card<00:01:39.849> will<00:01:40.479> just<00:01:40.720> write<00:01:41.050> itself<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
the card will just write itself in the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.510 
the card will just write itself in the
air<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:44.170> find<00:01:44.739> that<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.310> more

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
air and I find that this is more

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.300 
air and I find that this is more
accurate<00:01:45.789> sometimes<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.349> this<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:47.920> used

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
accurate sometimes but and this is used

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.850 
accurate sometimes but and this is used
for<00:01:48.459> more<00:01:48.670> speed<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.660> guess<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.229> can<00:01:50.530> adapt

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
for more speed but I guess you can adapt

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.930 
for more speed but I guess you can adapt
your<00:01:51.069> own<00:01:51.220> situation<00:01:52.380> hello<00:01:53.380> again<00:01:53.709> I<00:01:54.130> just

your own situation hello again I just
want<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.209> point<00:01:55.450> out<00:01:55.660> that<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:57.039> target<00:01:57.489> you

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
want to point out that the target you

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.960 
want to point out that the target you
are<00:01:57.789> using<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.360> also<00:01:58.780> very<00:01:59.080> important<00:01:59.970> i'm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
are using and also very important i'm

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.910 
are using and also very important i'm
using<00:02:01.830> rather<00:02:02.830> thick<00:02:03.520> like<00:02:04.319> maybe<00:02:05.319> two<00:02:05.739> inch

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
using rather thick like maybe two inch

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.210 
using rather thick like maybe two inch
three<00:02:06.399> inch<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.929> styrofoam<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:09.009> an

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
three inch of styrofoam it's an

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.000 
three inch of styrofoam it's an
insulator<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.569> stuff's<00:02:11.010> actually

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
insulator this stuff's actually

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.820 
insulator this stuff's actually
extremely<00:02:12.550> hard<00:02:13.060> i<00:02:13.270> probably<00:02:13.510> should<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
extremely hard i probably should get a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.400 
extremely hard i probably should get a
normal<00:02:15.280> kind<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.879> styrofoam<00:02:16.599> because<00:02:17.230> it

normal kind of styrofoam because it

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.380 
normal kind of styrofoam because it
works<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.739> lot<00:02:17.830> better<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.790> lot<00:02:18.879> easier<00:02:18.910> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
works a lot better it's a lot easier to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.100 
works a lot better it's a lot easier to
get<00:02:19.510> card<00:02:19.930> stuck<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
get card stuck in it is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.550 
get card stuck in it is
looks<00:02:21.290> cool<00:02:22.990> now<00:02:23.990> for<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.380> little

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
looks cool now for a little

00:02:24.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
looks cool now for a little
demonstration

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.570 

okay<00:03:19.200> those<00:03:19.560> prime<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.040> crappiest

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
okay those prime I crappiest

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.930 
okay those prime I crappiest
card-throwing<00:03:21.260> ever<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:24.110> guess<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.380> can

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
card-throwing ever but I guess we can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.990 
card-throwing ever but I guess we can
see<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.030> there<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.510> few<00:03:28.260> cards<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.830> there

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.060 

yeah<00:03:36.000> there's<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.630> couple<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.230> there<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.710> said

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
yeah there's a couple in there I said

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.580 
yeah there's a couple in there I said
it's<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.580> very<00:03:39.090> thick<00:03:39.750> foam<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.380> very

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's a very thick foam and it's very

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.840 
it's a very thick foam and it's very
hard<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> get<00:03:41.040> cards<00:03:41.610> stuck<00:03:42.060> into<00:03:42.740> but<00:03:43.850> they

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
hard to get cards stuck into but they

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.690 
hard to get cards stuck into but they
are<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.270> deep<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.110> want<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.700> keep

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
are pretty deep you just want to keep

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.470 
are pretty deep you just want to keep
your<00:03:48.330> wrist<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.520> want<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.910> flick<00:03:51.300> it

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
your wrist kind of you want to flick it

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.380 
your wrist kind of you want to flick it
more<00:03:52.140> than<00:03:52.410> using<00:03:53.400> your<00:03:54.090> arm<00:03:54.590> plucking<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
more than using your arm plucking is the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:11.540 
more than using your arm plucking is the
key<00:04:08.060> okay<00:04:09.060> another<00:04:09.780> detail<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:10.980> left<00:04:11.250> out

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
key okay another detail that I left out

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.360 
key okay another detail that I left out
then<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.450> guess<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.810> shouldn't<00:04:13.200> have<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.710> you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
then I guess I shouldn't have is you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.460 
then I guess I shouldn't have is you
want<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.610> make<00:04:14.700> sure<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.540> your<00:04:15.870> cards<00:04:16.320> are

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
want to make sure that your cards are

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.100 
want to make sure that your cards are
all<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:16.890> same<00:04:16.970> direction<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.660> pile<00:04:18.959> is

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
all in the same direction that pile is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.289 
all in the same direction that pile is
kind<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.470> mixed<00:04:19.770> up<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.970> keep<00:04:21.150> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
kind of mixed up and I like to keep a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.320 
kind of mixed up and I like to keep a
little<00:04:21.450> curve<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.410> cards<00:04:22.770> for

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
little curve in the cards for

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.110 
little curve in the cards for
aerodynamics<00:04:24.330> if<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.710> even<00:04:26.550> does<00:04:26.730> anything

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
aerodynamics if that even does anything

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.920 
aerodynamics if that even does anything
so<00:04:28.110> just<00:04:28.590> make<00:04:29.430> sure<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:30.180> all<00:04:30.420> your

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
so just make sure that you have all your

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.170 
so just make sure that you have all your
cards<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> right<00:04:31.800> order<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.340> I'm<00:04:32.880> going

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
cards in the right order and I'm going

00:04:33.180 --> 00:06:05.920 
cards in the right order and I'm going
to<00:04:33.240> try<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.600> put

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.490 

see<00:06:06.930> we<00:06:07.140> got<00:06:07.320> here<00:06:10.160> few<00:06:11.160> cards<00:06:12.050> not<00:06:13.050> as<00:06:13.170> good<00:06:13.350> as

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
see we got here few cards not as good as

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.530 
see we got here few cards not as good as
I've<00:06:13.680> wanted<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.310> be<00:06:14.580> but<00:06:14.850> I've<00:06:15.210> only<00:06:15.360> been

I've wanted to be but I've only been

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.620 
I've wanted to be but I've only been
throwing<00:06:15.900> cards<00:06:16.140> for<00:06:16.560> few<00:06:17.340> weeks<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:17.910> i'll<00:06:18.480> get

better<00:06:18.980> all<00:06:19.980> right<00:06:20.220> there<00:06:20.550> has<00:06:20.760> been<00:06:20.970> a<00:06:21.000> debate

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
better all right there has been a debate

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.500 
better all right there has been a debate
what<00:06:21.990> their<00:06:22.170> cards<00:06:22.620> hurt<00:06:23.010> or<00:06:23.820> not<00:06:24.090> some<00:06:24.480> people

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
what their cards hurt or not some people

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.080 
what their cards hurt or not some people
say<00:06:25.050> they<00:06:25.260> don't<00:06:25.470> people<00:06:25.860> are<00:06:26.070> just<00:06:26.310> actors<00:06:26.760> um

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
say they don't people are just actors um

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.260 
say they don't people are just actors um
this<00:06:27.960> is<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.650> side<00:06:29.160> that<00:06:29.190> I<00:06:29.520> just<00:06:29.880> hit<00:06:30.090> with

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
this is the side that I just hit with

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.840 
this is the side that I just hit with
the<00:06:30.420> cards<00:06:30.900> and<00:06:31.160> you<00:06:32.160> can't<00:06:32.400> really<00:06:32.520> see<00:06:32.670> the

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
the cards and you can't really see the

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.240 
the cards and you can't really see the
depth<00:06:33.240> of<00:06:33.420> them<00:06:33.630> but<00:06:34.350> they<00:06:34.620> go<00:06:34.830> pretty<00:06:35.070> deep

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
depth of them but they go pretty deep

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.130 
depth of them but they go pretty deep
and<00:06:35.940> that's<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:37.010> good<00:06:38.010> side<00:06:38.450> this<00:06:39.450> is<00:06:39.690> the

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
and that's the good side this is the

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.270 
and that's the good side this is the
other<00:06:40.230> side<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.770> dike<00:06:40.980> Hughes<00:06:41.430> and<00:06:42.500> I<00:06:43.500> don't

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
other side the dike Hughes and I don't

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.680 
other side the dike Hughes and I don't
think<00:06:44.400> you'd<00:06:44.610> want<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.910> get<00:06:45.000> hit<00:06:45.240> with<00:06:45.390> one<00:06:45.600> of

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
think you'd want to get hit with one of

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.190 
think you'd want to get hit with one of
these<00:06:45.780> they<00:06:46.140> were<00:06:46.200> going<00:06:46.560> for<00:06:46.880> so<00:06:47.880> uh<00:06:47.930> be<00:06:48.930> safe

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
these they were going for so uh be safe

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.140 
these they were going for so uh be safe
when<00:06:49.470> you're<00:06:49.620> throwing<00:06:50.010> them<00:06:50.340> if<00:06:50.550> you've<00:06:50.880> got

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
when you're throwing them if you've got

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.510 
when you're throwing them if you've got
skills
