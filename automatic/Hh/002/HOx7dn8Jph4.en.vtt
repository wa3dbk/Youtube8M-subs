00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
0.3 to 2 megapixel I now let's see how

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
0.3 to 2 megapixel I now let's see how
the<00:00:41.969> quality<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.200> photo<00:00:43.469> sees<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.370> before

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the quality of the photo sees so before

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
the quality of the photo sees so before
that<00:00:44.670> let's<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.200> camera

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that let's have a look at the camera

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.830 
that let's have a look at the camera
interface<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.160> let's<00:00:47.370> open<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.789> camera<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
interface so let's open the camera so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410 
interface so let's open the camera so
that's<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> camera<00:00:49.350> app<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.980> Micromax<00:00:50.879> unit<00:00:51.180> 3

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and as you can see from the camera there

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
and as you can see from the camera there
isn't<00:00:53.579> any<00:00:53.699> change<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.420> respect<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.870> the

click
the<00:02:08.640> camera<00:02:09.600> button<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.250> kind<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the camera button and it's it's kind of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
the camera button and it's it's kind of
not<00:02:11.820> really<00:02:12.270> user-friendly<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:13.140> their<00:02:13.290> face

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
not really user-friendly in their face

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.920 
not really user-friendly in their face
so<00:02:13.740> that's<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.850> interface<00:02:15.030> aspect<00:02:15.600> now<00:02:15.720> let's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so that's the interface aspect now let's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.180 
so that's the interface aspect now let's
go<00:02:16.080> into<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> photos

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
go into the photos

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.340 
go into the photos
so<00:02:17.820> first<00:02:18.060> let's<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.200> daily

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
so first let's have a look at the daily

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.200 
so first let's have a look at the daily
charts<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.460> are<00:02:20.580> some<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> daylight

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.790 
charts so here are some of the daylight
charts<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.320> see<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
charts and as you can see from the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.860 
charts and as you can see from the
daylight<00:02:23.130> shot<00:02:23.370> some<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.270> colors<00:02:24.570> looked

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
daylight shot some the colors looked

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.770 
daylight shot some the colors looked
pretty<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:26.160> good<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.640> must<00:02:27.090> say<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.570> color

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
pretty pretty good I must say the color

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.810 
pretty pretty good I must say the color
quality<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.770> pretty<00:02:29.040> decent<00:02:29.190> although<00:02:29.700> not

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
quality is pretty decent although not

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.400 
quality is pretty decent although not
the<00:02:30.000> best<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.450> category<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> color

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the best in this category but the color

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.830 
the best in this category but the color
quality<00:02:31.590> does<00:02:32.130> look<00:02:32.430> pretty<00:02:33.030> decent<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
quality does look pretty decent for a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.500 
quality does look pretty decent for a
budget<00:02:34.110> smartphone<00:02:34.740> but<00:02:35.220> what<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.180> really

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
that great on this camera is a contrast

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
that great on this camera is a contrast
ratio<00:02:38.490> it's<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.600> contrast<00:02:39.930> seems<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.560> on

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770

the<00:02:40.890> higher<00:02:41.070> side<00:02:41.270> than<00:02:42.270> what<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.660> would<00:02:43.110> like

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the higher side than what we would like

as a result the photos are not really

as a result the photos are not really
that<00:02:48.630> great<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.830> an<00:02:49.950> average<00:02:50.310> quality

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that great but it's an average quality

we would we would still see the redmi 2

it's<00:03:27.300> pretty<00:03:27.450> decent<00:03:27.930> camera<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.700> take<00:03:30.120> a

it's pretty decent camera it can take a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.120 
it's pretty decent camera it can take a
pretty<00:03:30.510> decent<00:03:30.930> captures<00:03:31.320> as<00:03:31.530> well<00:03:31.740> the

pretty decent captures as well the

pretty decent captures as well the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
colors look again pretty good but again

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.800 
colors look again pretty good but again
as<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.380> said<00:03:34.560> before<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:35.550> contrast<00:03:36.060> doesn't

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
as I said before the contrast doesn't

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.620 
as I said before the contrast doesn't
look<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.380> good<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.850> overall<00:03:39.090> cólera<00:03:39.450> T

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
look that good and the overall cólera T

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.620 
look that good and the overall cólera T
is<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.840> average<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:41.520> it's<00:03:41.640> not<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
is just average so it's not really the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.810 
is just average so it's not really the
best<00:03:42.900> camera<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.830> price<00:03:44.130> point<00:03:44.400> now

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
best camera in this price point now

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.550 
best camera in this price point now
talking<00:03:45.030> about<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.390> low-light<00:03:45.750> photos<00:03:45.959> this

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
talking about the low-light photos this

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.949 
talking about the low-light photos this
is<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> strength<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.520> this<00:03:47.640> camera<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.840> can

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
is not a strength of this camera we can

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.800 
is not a strength of this camera we can
say<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> low-light<00:03:49.920> photos<00:03:50.100> are<00:03:50.810> noisy

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
say that the low-light photos are noisy

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.810 
say that the low-light photos are noisy
and<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.350> clarity<00:03:52.800> doesn't<00:03:53.160> look<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.340> great

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and the clarity doesn't look that great

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.600 
and the clarity doesn't look that great
with<00:03:54.420> flash<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.050> quality<00:03:55.500> does<00:03:55.950> improve<00:03:56.370> but

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
with flash the quality does improve but

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.480 
with flash the quality does improve but
again<00:03:56.910> not<00:03:57.390> really<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.900> best<00:03:58.080> flash<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
again not really the best flash in the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.780 
again not really the best flash in the
budget<00:03:59.820> segment<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.750> ultra<00:04:01.080> low<00:04:01.290> light

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
budget segment in the ultra low light

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.520 
budget segment in the ultra low light
captures<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.209> has<00:04:03.360> gone<00:04:03.630> really<00:04:03.660> dark<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
captures it has gone really dark and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.550 
captures it has gone really dark and
again<00:04:05.310> doesn't<00:04:06.239> have<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.630> good<00:04:06.840> clarity<00:04:07.380> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
again doesn't have that good clarity and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.820 
again doesn't have that good clarity and
with<00:04:08.190> artificial<00:04:08.790> lighting<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.420> photos<00:04:09.830> does

with artificial lighting the photos does

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.650 
with artificial lighting the photos does
come<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.130> pretty<00:04:11.459> decent<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.510> noise

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
come a pretty decent but the noise

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.490 
come a pretty decent but the noise
levels<00:04:13.110> are

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500
