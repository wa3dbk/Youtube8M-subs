all<00:00:01.230> right<00:00:01.380> canceling<00:00:01.920> down<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.340> lowest<00:00:02.669> terms

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
all right canceling down to lowest terms

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.380 
all right canceling down to lowest terms
sometimes<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.160> fractions<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.819> get<00:00:05.970> something

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
sometimes in fractions you get something

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.290 
sometimes in fractions you get something
that<00:00:06.569> looks<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.899> bit<00:00:06.930> like<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.880> so<00:00:08.880> you've<00:00:09.059> got

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
that looks a bit like that so you've got

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.970 
that looks a bit like that so you've got
a<00:00:09.540> number<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.080> top<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> number<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
a number on top of the number on the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
a number on top of the number on the
bottom<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.580> there<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.210> common<00:00:12.630> factor

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
bottom and there is a common factor

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.829 
bottom and there is a common factor
between<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.590> numbers<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> guess<00:00:15.660> what

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
between the numbers so have a guess what

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
between the numbers so have a guess what
the<00:00:15.990> common<00:00:16.260> factor<00:00:16.619> might<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the common factor might be just take a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.380 
the common factor might be just take a
couple<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.940> seconds<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.390> think<00:00:20.150> there<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.240> go

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
couple of seconds to think there you go

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.410 
couple of seconds to think there you go
the<00:00:21.869> common<00:00:22.140> factor<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.970> some<00:00:23.970> people<00:00:24.269> might

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the common factor for some people might

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.450 
the common factor for some people might
divide<00:00:24.779> by<00:00:24.960> 2<00:00:25.019> then<00:00:25.439> divide<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:25.890> 2<00:00:25.920> again

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
divide by 2 then divide by 2 again

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859 
divide by 2 then divide by 2 again
that's<00:00:26.670> okay<00:00:27.090> we'll<00:00:27.300> come<00:00:27.449> back<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> that

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
that's okay we'll come back to that

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.849 
that's okay we'll come back to that
later<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> 12<00:00:30.119> divided<00:00:30.510> by<00:00:30.539> 4<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:30.960> 3<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.560> 20

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
later so 12 divided by 4 is 3 and 20

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.729 
later so 12 divided by 4 is 3 and 20
divided<00:00:32.309> by<00:00:32.460> 4<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.880> 5<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> fraction<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
divided by 4 is 5 so the fraction is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.910 
divided by 4 is 5 so the fraction is
equivalent<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.489> 3/5<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:37.170> means<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
equivalent to 3/5 that means that if you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
equivalent to 3/5 that means that if you
made<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.610> orange<00:00:38.850> juice<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.300> 12<00:00:39.540> powers

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
made some orange juice with 12 powers

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
made some orange juice with 12 powers
orange<00:00:40.079> juice<00:00:40.320> 20<00:00:40.649> parts<00:00:40.920> water<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.399> would

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
orange juice 20 parts water it would

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.209 
orange juice 20 parts water it would
taste<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> same<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:43.079> 3<00:00:43.350> parts<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.860> introduced

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
taste the same as 3 parts are introduced

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.799 
taste the same as 3 parts are introduced
five<00:00:44.460> parts<00:00:44.879> water<00:00:45.059> Peters<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.780> less<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
five parts water Peters have less of it

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
five parts water Peters have less of it
same<00:00:48.809> thing<00:00:49.020> works<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.350> larger<00:00:49.739> numbers<00:00:50.270> so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
same thing works for larger numbers so

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.340 
same thing works for larger numbers so
here<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.629> 28<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> 63<00:00:53.059> 2860<00:00:54.059> thirds<00:00:54.350> now

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
here I've got 28 and 63 2860 thirds now

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
here I've got 28 and 63 2860 thirds now
what<00:00:55.559> times<00:00:55.829> table<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> numbers<00:00:57.390> 28<00:00:57.750> and

what times table are the numbers 28 and
63<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> remember<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.730> times

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
63 and which is remember your times

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
63 and which is remember your times
tables<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.570> what's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> common<00:01:01.170> factor

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
tables or what's the common factor

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.500 
tables or what's the common factor
between<00:01:01.620> those<00:01:02.100> two<00:01:02.309> numbers<00:01:05.180> as<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.390> our<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
between those two numbers as for our I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
between those two numbers as for our I
got<00:01:06.810> seven<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.740> both<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> seven<00:01:08.490> times

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
got seven for both in the seven times

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.420 
got seven for both in the seven times
table<00:01:09.229> now<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.619> seven<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> twenty<00:01:11.400> eight

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
table now it's for seven to twenty eight

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
table now it's for seven to twenty eight
nine<00:01:12.180> seven<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.689> 63<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.590> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> divide<00:01:14.130> 28

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
nine seven to 63 so when you divide 28

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570 
nine seven to 63 so when you divide 28
by<00:01:14.850> seven<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.479> write<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.259> four<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
by seven you can write down the four and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.609 
by seven you can write down the four and
when<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> divide<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> 63<00:01:18.840> by<00:01:18.990> seven<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
when you divide the 63 by seven you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.499 
when you divide the 63 by seven you can
write<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.189> nine<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.240> your

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
write down the nine so that's your

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
write down the nine so that's your
equivalent<00:01:21.750> fraction<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.560> fraction<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
equivalent fraction that fraction is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
equivalent fraction that fraction is
lowest<00:01:23.729> terms<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.689> there's<00:01:24.930> no<00:01:25.170> common

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
lowest terms because there's no common

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.070 
lowest terms because there's no common
factor<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.159> left<00:01:26.490> other<00:01:26.790> than<00:01:26.820> 1<00:01:27.210> between<00:01:27.509> 4<00:01:27.930> &amp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
factor now left other than 1 between 4 &amp;
9<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.700> there's<00:01:29.700> no<00:01:29.820> number<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> 4

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
9 so there's no number that can go in 4

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
9 so there's no number that can go in 4
and<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> 9<00:01:31.439> without<00:01:31.740> leaving<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> remainder

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and go in 9 without leaving a remainder

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
and go in 9 without leaving a remainder
except<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.390> goes<00:01:33.659> into<00:01:33.869> everything<00:01:34.200> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
except one which goes into everything so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
except one which goes into everything so
4/9<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> special<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.689> called<00:01:36.900> lowest

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
4/9 is special and it's called lowest

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.870 
4/9 is special and it's called lowest
terms<00:01:39.500> sometimes<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.520> numbers

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
terms sometimes you you have numbers

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
terms sometimes you you have numbers
that<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.270> large<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.990> can't<00:01:43.380> spot<00:01:43.770> the

that are so large you can't spot the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
that are so large you can't spot the
common<00:01:44.340> factors<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.850> by<00:01:45.060> looking<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.600> know

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
common factors just by looking you know

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
common factors just by looking you know
that<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> can't<00:01:46.259> spot<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> highest<00:01:46.950> common

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that you can't spot the highest common

that you can't spot the highest common
factor<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:47.970> looking<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> there's<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
factor just by looking so there's a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609

fairly large number 243 hundred and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.499 
fairly large number 243 hundred and
thirtieth<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> say<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.119> fractions

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
thirtieth I have to say that fractions

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
thirtieth I have to say that fractions
like<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.140> crop<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.890> often<00:01:56.100> in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
like that don't crop up very often in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.889 
like that don't crop up very often in
fact<00:01:56.579> probably<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.180> last<00:01:57.329> time<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.659> saw<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
fact probably the last time you saw a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
fact probably the last time you saw a
fraction<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> last<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.000> he

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
fraction like that was the last time he

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.260 
fraction like that was the last time he
studied<00:02:00.509> maths

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
studied maths

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.270 
studied maths
so<00:02:02.870> we<00:02:02.990> break<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.350> down<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.620> stages<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
so we break it down in stages the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.520 
so we break it down in stages the
obvious<00:02:04.640> one<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.630> divide<00:02:05.930> by<00:02:06.200> 10

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
obvious one to do is to divide by 10

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.559 
obvious one to do is to divide by 10
because<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.220> both<00:02:07.430> numbers<00:02:07.820> happen<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.390> end

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
because but both numbers happen to end

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.250 
because but both numbers happen to end
in<00:02:08.750> 0<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.490> get<00:02:10.610> 24<00:02:11.060> 30<00:02:11.390> thirds<00:02:11.720> that's<00:02:11.959> much

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
in 0 so we get 24 30 thirds that's much

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.309 
in 0 so we get 24 30 thirds that's much
smaller<00:02:12.590> now<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:12.860> looking<00:02:13.130> easy<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.580> deal<00:02:13.760> with

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
smaller now is looking easy to deal with

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.860 
smaller now is looking easy to deal with
so<00:02:15.520> can<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.090> number<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.690> goes

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
so can you think of a number that goes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.800 
so can you think of a number that goes
into<00:02:18.260> 24<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.069> goes<00:02:19.400> into<00:02:19.730> 33<00:02:20.090> without<00:02:20.600> leaving

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
into 24 and goes into 33 without leaving

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.490 
into 24 and goes into 33 without leaving
a<00:02:20.989> remainder

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
a remainder

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.150 
a remainder
well<00:02:22.340> 33<00:02:23.060> s<00:02:23.120> can<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.690> 311<00:02:24.620> s<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:25.040> were

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
well 33 s can of 311 s that were

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.729 
well 33 s can of 311 s that were
thinking<00:02:25.310> around<00:02:25.700> 3<00:02:26.090> s<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.420> 3<00:02:26.660> goes<00:02:26.900> into<00:02:27.140> 24

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
thinking around 3 s and 3 goes into 24

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.600 
thinking around 3 s and 3 goes into 24
eight<00:02:28.600> times<00:02:29.600> doesn't<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.430> thinking<00:02:31.430> about

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
eight times doesn't it thinking about

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.600 
eight times doesn't it thinking about
dividing<00:02:32.060> by<00:02:32.180> 3<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.739> get<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.040> 8<00:02:34.160> xi

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
dividing by 3 and then you get to 8 xi

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.490 
dividing by 3 and then you get to 8 xi
xi<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.300> course<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> prime<00:02:35.959> number<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.320> you

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
xi of course is a prime number so you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.840 
xi of course is a prime number so you
know<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.709> can't<00:02:36.980> go<00:02:37.130> any<00:02:37.250> further<00:02:37.489> and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
know you can't go any further and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.160 
know you can't go any further and
there's<00:02:37.970> nothing<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.390> nothing<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.959> can<00:02:39.080> go

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
there's nothing and nothing that can go

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.800 
there's nothing and nothing that can go
into<00:02:39.350> both<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.530> them<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> here's<00:02:41.480> another

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
into both of them so here's another

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.080 
into both of them so here's another
example

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
example

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.420 
example
this<00:02:44.090> one's<00:02:44.330> extremely<00:02:45.019> large<00:02:45.200> right<00:02:45.950> not

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
this one's extremely large right not

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.780 
this one's extremely large right not
something<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.970> notice<00:02:47.180> every<00:02:47.690> day<00:02:48.190> 612<00:02:50.650> 1638

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
something you notice every day 612 1638

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.979 
something you notice every day 612 1638
you<00:02:52.790> know<00:02:52.880> even<00:02:53.150> our<00:02:53.239> language<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.780> quite

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
you know even our language is quite

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.890 
you know even our language is quite
clumsy<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.560> yet<00:02:54.709> two<00:02:54.830> numbers<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.160> big<00:02:55.900> so

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
clumsy and yet two numbers that big so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.270 
clumsy and yet two numbers that big so
the<00:02:57.019> first<00:02:57.230> thing<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.800> note<00:02:58.040> that

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the first thing to do is note that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890 
the first thing to do is note that
they're<00:02:58.400> both<00:02:58.550> even<00:02:58.970> numbers<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.810> I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
they're both even numbers so I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.050 
they're both even numbers so I
immediately<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.739> can<00:03:00.860> divide<00:03:01.220> by<00:03:01.459> 2<00:03:01.489> just<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
immediately I can divide by 2 just to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.460 
immediately I can divide by 2 just to
get<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.360> numbers<00:03:02.690> smaller<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:03.170> make<00:03:03.319> them

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
get the numbers smaller to make them

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.380 
get the numbers smaller to make them
easy<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.830> work<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.350> 612<00:03:06.350> divided<00:03:06.799> by<00:03:06.920> 2<00:03:06.980> is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
easy to work with so 612 divided by 2 is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.789 
easy to work with so 612 divided by 2 is
306<00:03:09.310> 1638<00:03:10.310> divided<00:03:11.000> by<00:03:11.180> 2<00:03:11.239> well<00:03:11.720> 2<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.170> 16<00:03:12.500> goes

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
306 1638 divided by 2 well 2 to 16 goes

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.860 
306 1638 divided by 2 well 2 to 16 goes
18<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.640> 38<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:15.579> 19<00:03:16.579> so<00:03:17.390> there<00:03:17.600> we<00:03:17.720> are

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
18 to 38 go 19 so there we are

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.870 
18 to 38 go 19 so there we are
it's<00:03:18.049> 306<00:03:19.010> over<00:03:19.600> 819<00:03:20.600> smaller<00:03:21.140> numbers<00:03:21.820> now<00:03:22.820> we

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
it's 306 over 819 smaller numbers now we

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.850 
it's 306 over 819 smaller numbers now we
can't<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.660> anymore<00:03:24.019> can<00:03:24.260> we<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.650> think

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
can't use to anymore can we so we think

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.900 
can't use to anymore can we so we think
about<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.160> next<00:03:25.280> number<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.670> will<00:03:25.880> divide

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
about the next number that will divide

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.789 
about the next number that will divide
in<00:03:26.329> both<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.799> look<00:03:28.100> at<00:03:28.360> 819<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:29.900> 81<00:03:30.380> and

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
in both if you look at 819 it's 81 and

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.670 
in both if you look at 819 it's 81 and
then<00:03:31.220> 9<00:03:31.519> isn't<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.390> 3<00:03:32.630> will<00:03:32.780> go<00:03:32.900> into<00:03:33.049> 81<00:03:33.410> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
then 9 isn't it so 3 will go into 81 and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.620 
then 9 isn't it so 3 will go into 81 and
Thrilla<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.070> into<00:03:34.280> 9<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:35.030> pretty

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
Thrilla go into 9 and it's pretty

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.600 
Thrilla go into 9 and it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.620> see<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.980> 3<00:03:37.310> will<00:03:37.489> go

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
straightforward to see the 3 will go

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.130 
straightforward to see the 3 will go
into<00:03:37.870> 306<00:03:39.250> because<00:03:40.250> 3<00:03:40.549> can<00:03:40.700> go<00:03:40.850> into<00:03:41.000> 30<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.810> 3

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
into 306 because 3 can go into 30 and 3

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.580 
into 306 because 3 can go into 30 and 3
goes<00:03:42.320> into<00:03:42.530> 6<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.180> divide<00:03:44.329> by<00:03:44.660> 3<00:03:45.079> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
goes into 6 so if you divide by 3 you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.229 
goes into 6 so if you divide by 3 you
end<00:03:45.769> up<00:03:45.950> with<00:03:46.220> 102<00:03:47.030> over<00:03:48.160> 273<00:03:49.160> but<00:03:50.000> we're<00:03:50.120> not

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
end up with 102 over 273 but we're not

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.670 
end up with 102 over 273 but we're not
out<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.660> woods<00:03:50.810> yet<00:03:51.109> because<00:03:51.470> there's

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
out of the woods yet because there's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.759 
out of the woods yet because there's
still<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:51.890> common<00:03:52.160> factor<00:03:53.290> now<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.470> so

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
still a common factor now it just so

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
still a common factor now it just so
happens<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.489> 3<00:03:56.120> will<00:03:56.329> go<00:03:56.480> into<00:03:56.660> both<00:03:56.900> of

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
happens that 3 will go into both of

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.650 
happens that 3 will go into both of
those<00:03:57.290> 3<00:03:58.480> into<00:03:59.480> 102<00:04:00.290> well<00:04:00.650> 3<00:04:00.980> into<00:04:01.250> 10<00:04:01.459> goes<00:04:02.090> 3

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
those 3 into 102 well 3 into 10 goes 3

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.140 
those 3 into 102 well 3 into 10 goes 3
remainder<00:04:03.079> 1<00:04:03.290> put<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.799> one<00:04:03.950> next<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.430> 2<00:04:04.670> 3

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
remainder 1 put the one next to the 2 3

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.530 
remainder 1 put the one next to the 2 3
into<00:04:05.359> 12<00:04:05.600> goes<00:04:05.989> for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
into 12 goes for

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.880 
into 12 goes for
and<00:04:07.810> that's<00:04:07.959> that's<00:04:08.140> 34<00:04:08.680> on<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.890> top<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.400> then

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
and that's that's 34 on the top and then

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.740 
and that's that's 34 on the top and then
273<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:12.099> 27<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.819> 3<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.420> know<00:04:13.540> that's

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
273 is for 27 and a 3 so you know that's

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.469 
273 is for 27 and a 3 so you know that's
going<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> be<00:04:14.049> 91<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:15.220> there<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.519> are<00:04:15.549> 34<00:04:16.209> over

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
going to be 91 so there we are 34 over

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.460 
going to be 91 so there we are 34 over
90<00:04:16.780> watt<00:04:17.400> that's<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.940> smallest<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.290> get

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
90 watt that's the smallest you can get

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.530 
90 watt that's the smallest you can get
it<00:04:20.650> because<00:04:20.769> 3<00:04:21.130> doesn't<00:04:21.459> go<00:04:21.489> into<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:22.000> 34

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
it because 3 doesn't go into the 34

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.080 
it because 3 doesn't go into the 34
anymore<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.169> factors<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.680> 91<00:04:24.190> 91<00:04:24.639> almost

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
anymore and the factors of 91 91 almost

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.520 
anymore and the factors of 91 91 almost
looks<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.510> prime<00:04:25.780> number<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.289> isn't

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
looks like a prime number but it isn't

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.110 
looks like a prime number but it isn't
but<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.860> factors<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.250> 91<00:04:27.699> are<00:04:27.820> fairly

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
but the factors of 91 are fairly

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480 
but the factors of 91 are fairly
difficult<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.930> find<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.800> finish<00:04:30.310> that's

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
difficult to find so you finish that's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.290 
difficult to find so you finish that's
lowest<00:04:30.910> terms<00:04:32.610> there<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.729> as<00:04:34.000> I've<00:04:34.180> mentioned

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
lowest terms there is as I've mentioned

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.590 
lowest terms there is as I've mentioned
already<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:35.020> link<00:04:35.260> with<00:04:35.470> prime<00:04:35.800> factors<00:04:36.400> if<00:04:37.360> we

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
already a link with prime factors if we

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.129 
already a link with prime factors if we
take<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.930> previous<00:04:38.139> example<00:04:39.389> 612<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.630> start

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
take the previous example 612 and start

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.719 
take the previous example 612 and start
looking<00:04:41.320> at<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.620> prime<00:04:41.949> factors<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.580> that

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
looking at the prime factors of that

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.930 
looking at the prime factors of that
number<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:44.440> can<00:04:44.620> divide<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.039> by<00:04:45.190> 2<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.729> you

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
number you can divide it by 2 and you

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.120 
number you can divide it by 2 and you
get<00:04:46.120> 306<00:04:46.930> then<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.229> can<00:04:47.380> divide<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.860> by<00:04:48.070> 2

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
get 306 then you can divide that by 2

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.300 
get 306 then you can divide that by 2
and<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.490> get<00:04:48.750> 153<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.860> can<00:04:51.010> divide<00:04:51.280> that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
and you get 153 and you can divide that

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.689 
and you get 153 and you can divide that
by<00:04:51.729> 3<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.810> get<00:04:52.930> 51<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.310> can<00:04:54.460> divide

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
by 3 and you get 51 and you can divide

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.290 
by 3 and you get 51 and you can divide
51<00:04:55.180> by<00:04:55.389> 3<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.840> get<00:04:55.960> 17<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.580> numbers<00:04:57.910> in<00:04:58.030> red

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
51 by 3 and get 17 so the numbers in red

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
the same prime factor so we can cancel a

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.710 
the same prime factor so we can cancel a
2<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:57.280> 2<00:05:58.020> we<00:05:59.020> can<00:05:59.199> cancel<00:05:59.409> a<00:05:59.650> 3<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.070> a<00:06:00.130> 3<00:06:00.720> now

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
2 and a 2 we can cancel a 3 and a 3 now

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.629 
2 and a 2 we can cancel a 3 and a 3 now
we<00:06:01.780> can<00:06:02.050> cancel<00:06:02.260> a<00:06:02.470> 3<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:02.830> a<00:06:02.860> 3<00:06:03.010> again<00:06:03.220> and

that's<00:06:03.849> it<00:06:04.090> there's<00:06:04.539> nothing<00:06:04.840> else<00:06:04.990> now<00:06:05.229> let's

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
that's it there's nothing else now let's

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.820 
that's it there's nothing else now let's
comment<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.949> top<00:06:06.159> and<00:06:06.340> bottom<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:08.080> we've<00:06:08.260> got<00:06:08.470> 2

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
comment to top and bottom so we've got 2

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.600 
comment to top and bottom so we've got 2
times<00:06:09.190> 17<00:06:09.550> on<00:06:09.849> the<00:06:09.940> top<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.590> 7<00:06:11.590> times<00:06:11.770> 13<00:06:12.159> on

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
times 17 on the top and 7 times 13 on

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.029 
times 17 on the top and 7 times 13 on
the<00:06:12.760> bottom<00:06:13.090> what<00:06:14.020> we've<00:06:14.169> crossed<00:06:14.470> out<00:06:14.710> is

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
the bottom what we've crossed out is

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.890 
the bottom what we've crossed out is
effectively<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.789> prime<00:06:16.150> factors<00:06:16.630> of<00:06:16.810> the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
effectively the prime factors of the

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.690 
effectively the prime factors of the
highest<00:06:17.200> common<00:06:17.500> factor<00:06:17.530> of<00:06:18.070> 6

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
highest common factor of 6

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.920 
highest common factor of 6
hundred<00:06:18.880> and<00:06:18.940> twelve<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:20.790> 1638<00:06:21.790> so<00:06:22.300> 2<00:06:22.360> times<00:06:22.840> 3

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
hundred and twelve and 1638 so 2 times 3

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.930 
hundred and twelve and 1638 so 2 times 3
times<00:06:23.290> 3<00:06:23.440> is<00:06:23.650> 18<00:06:24.100> that<00:06:24.370> is<00:06:24.430> actually<00:06:24.850> the

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
times 3 is 18 that is actually the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.860 
times 3 is 18 that is actually the
highest<00:06:25.060> common<00:06:25.360> factor<00:06:25.390> of<00:06:25.720> 6<00:06:25.810> 1<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.320> 16<00:06:27.130> 38<00:06:27.870> so

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
highest common factor of 6 1 to 16 38 so

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.780 
highest common factor of 6 1 to 16 38 so
there's<00:06:29.080> the<00:06:29.200> sum<00:06:29.380> you<00:06:29.500> doing<00:06:29.770> we<00:06:30.070> get<00:06:30.310> gives

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
there's the sum you doing we get gives

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.570 
there's the sum you doing we get gives
us<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.060> same<00:06:31.270> answer<00:06:31.450> as<00:06:31.660> before<00:06:31.870> 34<00:06:32.860> over<00:06:33.040> 91

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
us the same answer as before 34 over 91

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.640 
us the same answer as before 34 over 91
but<00:06:34.270> by<00:06:34.420> using<00:06:34.630> prime<00:06:35.080> factors<00:06:35.530> were

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
but by using prime factors were

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.560 
but by using prime factors were
absolutely<00:06:36.190> secure<00:06:36.670> we<00:06:36.910> know<00:06:37.120> there<00:06:37.360> is<00:06:37.450> no

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
absolutely secure we know there is no

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.910 
absolutely secure we know there is no
common<00:06:37.930> factor<00:06:38.230> between<00:06:38.260> those<00:06:38.680> two<00:06:38.890> numbers

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
common factor between those two numbers

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.250 
common factor between those two numbers
they<00:06:39.370> 491<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.240> that<00:06:40.450> is<00:06:40.600> a<00:06:40.630> lowest<00:06:41.050> terms

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
they 491 and that is a lowest terms

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
they 491 and that is a lowest terms
fraction<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.940> that's<00:06:43.120> it
