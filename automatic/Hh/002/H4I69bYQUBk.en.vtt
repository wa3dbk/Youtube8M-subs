00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thirty-five dollars and let's just go

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
thirty-five dollars and let's just go
ahead<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> snap<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:15.600> my<00:01:15.630> iphone<00:01:16.619> 5<00:01:16.890> like

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
ahead and snap on into my iphone 5 like

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.670 
ahead and snap on into my iphone 5 like
so<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> great<00:01:17.970> fit<00:01:18.360> bamboo<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.170> obviously

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
so it's a great fit bamboo is obviously

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
so it's a great fit bamboo is obviously
a<00:01:19.770> lightweight<00:01:20.450> material<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.990> get

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a lightweight material so you don't get

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.630 
a lightweight material so you don't get
a<00:01:22.200> tremendous<00:01:22.470> amount<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.009> weight<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a tremendous amount of weight with this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
a tremendous amount of weight with this
as<00:01:23.880> far<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> ports<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.380> controls

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
as far as all the ports and controls

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
as far as all the ports and controls
it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> snap<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.790> style<00:01:27.030> k<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.360> it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it's a snap on the back style k so it's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020 
it's a snap on the back style k so it's
open<00:01:28.560> along<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> bottom<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:29.579> and

open along the bottom and the top and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
open along the bottom and the top and
then<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.600> cutouts<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> side

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
then it's got some cutouts on the side

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
then it's got some cutouts on the side
for<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> volume<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
for the volume up and down in the
vibrate<00:01:33.570> switch<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> keyhole<00:01:35.009> cutout

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
vibrate switch and then a keyhole cutout

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
vibrate switch and then a keyhole cutout
on<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.060> again<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.869> design<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.950> the

on the back and again the design or the
laser<00:01:38.250> engraving<00:01:38.670> looks<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.329> sharp<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
laser engraving looks really sharp it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
laser engraving looks really sharp it
gives<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> some<00:01:40.259> amount<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> grip<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
gives you some amount of grip because it
