00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
device I was working on here just a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.850 
device I was working on here just a
little<00:01:11.869> arrows<00:01:12.869> shooting<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.590> grass

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
little arrows shooting through the grass

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
little arrows shooting through the grass
so<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.130> can't<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> dispenser

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so you can't actually see the dispenser

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
so you can't actually see the dispenser
through<00:01:15.690> any<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.010> I<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.280> just

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
through any of this so I was just

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
through any of this so I was just
testing<00:01:17.960> how<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:20.030> grass<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.360> would<00:01:21.450> take<00:01:21.659> for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
testing how much grass it would take for

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
testing how much grass it would take for
the<00:01:22.350> dispenser<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.310> disappear<00:01:23.970> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the dispenser to actually disappear so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.170 
the dispenser to actually disappear so
we<00:01:24.570> could<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.840> shut<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.260> right<00:01:25.650> now

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
we could just shut that off right now

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.789 
we could just shut that off right now
yeah<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.479> okay<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.260> now<00:01:28.560> this

it's in the plus formation all the way
to<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.600> top<00:03:49.810> as<00:03:50.290> high<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.800> want<00:03:51.010> it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
to the top as high as you want it

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.890 
to the top as high as you want it
doesn't<00:03:51.820> matter<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.270> can<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.660> from

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
doesn't matter it can be in from

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.890 
doesn't matter it can be in from
infinitely<00:03:53.560> amount<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.280> high<00:03:54.600> it'll<00:03:55.600> take<00:03:55.780> it

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
infinitely amount of high it'll take it

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.420 
infinitely amount of high it'll take it
all<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.080> way<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.350> top<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.800> dispense<00:03:57.280> it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
all the way to the top and dispense it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.610 
all the way to the top and dispense it
there<00:03:57.670> now<00:03:58.600> what<00:03:58.750> we<00:03:58.840> need<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:58.990> do<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.500> need

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
there now what we need to do is we need

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.990 
there now what we need to do is we need
to<00:03:59.710> make<00:03:59.830> a<00:04:00.040> way<00:04:00.910> for<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.860> be<00:04:03.100> triggered

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
to make a way for this to be triggered

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.730 
to make a way for this to be triggered
now<00:04:04.720> there's<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.990> couple<00:04:05.170> different<00:04:05.290> ways<00:04:05.500> you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
now there's a couple different ways you

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.560 
now there's a couple different ways you
could<00:04:05.830> do<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.760> do<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.000> the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
could do this I like to do it the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
easiest way I find to do it is just with

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.480 
easiest way I find to do it is just with
some<00:04:10.060> redstone<00:04:10.660> redstone<00:04:11.650> repeaters<00:04:12.460> and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
some redstone redstone repeaters and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.970 
some redstone redstone repeaters and
some<00:04:13.390> actual<00:04:13.750> redstone<00:04:14.200> you're<00:04:14.710> also<00:04:14.800> gonna

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
only thing that needs to happen now is

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.410 
only thing that needs to happen now is
you<00:05:29.990> need<00:05:30.170> to<00:05:30.350> place<00:05:30.830> some<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:32.320> items<00:05:34.420> into

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
you need to place some of the items into

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.530 
you need to place some of the items into
the<00:05:36.140> dispenser<00:05:36.800> so<00:05:37.280> say<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.550> make<00:05:37.820> this<00:05:38.000> down

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
the dispenser so say you make this down

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.810 
the dispenser so say you make this down
in<00:05:38.720> your<00:05:38.750> mine<00:05:38.960> shaft<00:05:39.350> and<00:05:39.650> your<00:05:40.160> mining<00:05:40.610> away

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
in your mine shaft and your mining away

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.190 
in your mine shaft and your mining away
you<00:05:40.880> have<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> bunch<00:05:41.420> of<00:05:41.510> these<00:05:41.600> little<00:05:41.870> hoppers

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
you have a bunch of these little hoppers

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.780 
you have a bunch of these little hoppers
set<00:05:42.410> up<00:05:42.530> you<00:05:42.620> know<00:05:42.740> along<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.040> row<00:05:43.370> you're

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
set up you know along the row you're

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.550 
set up you know along the row you're
dropping<00:05:44.180> stuff<00:05:44.360> into<00:05:44.660> it<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.990> transfers<00:05:45.470> over

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
dropping stuff into it it transfers over

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.950 
dropping stuff into it it transfers over
into<00:05:45.710> this<00:05:45.950> one<00:05:46.160> comes<00:05:46.910> in<00:05:47.090> here<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.540> know

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
into this one comes in here you know

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.270 
into this one comes in here you know
comes<00:05:48.410> with<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.620> elevator<00:05:48.980> you<00:05:49.010> know<00:05:49.100> it's

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
comes with the elevator you know it's

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.760 
comes with the elevator you know it's
not<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.490> most<00:05:49.640> efficient<00:05:50.180> way<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.450> do<00:05:50.690> it<00:05:50.810> but

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
not the most efficient way to do it but

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.760 
not the most efficient way to do it but
it<00:05:51.980> definitely<00:05:52.250> is<00:05:53.320> doable<00:05:54.320> there's<00:05:54.620> other

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
it definitely is doable there's other

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.590 
it definitely is doable there's other
ways<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.190> use<00:05:55.580> it<00:05:55.760> too<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.150> can<00:05:56.270> use<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.480> on<00:05:56.570> a

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
ways to use it too you can use it on a

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.150 
ways to use it too you can use it on a
multiplayer<00:05:57.050> server<00:05:57.170> vanilla<00:05:57.740> multiplayer

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
multiplayer server vanilla multiplayer

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
you can come up with but this is the

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.670 
you can come up with but this is the

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
basic premise so I'll show you that it

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.460 
basic premise so I'll show you that it
works<00:06:18.800> now<00:06:19.130> just<00:06:19.550> by<00:06:19.700> queueing<00:06:20.330> in<00:06:20.630> some<00:06:21.380> of

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
works now just by queueing in some of

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.220 
works now just by queueing in some of
the<00:06:21.560> items<00:06:21.920> and<00:06:22.630> you<00:06:23.630> know<00:06:23.720> items<00:06:24.050> are<00:06:24.140> gonna

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
the items and you know items are gonna

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.870 
the items and you know items are gonna
fall<00:06:24.470> off<00:06:24.650> since<00:06:24.860> they<00:06:24.980> bounce<00:06:25.190> off<00:06:25.520> of<00:06:25.730> that

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
fall off since they bounce off of that

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.550 
fall off since they bounce off of that
but<00:06:26.540> once<00:06:27.200> this<00:06:27.470> is<00:06:27.650> cute<00:06:28.040> are<00:06:28.250> you<00:06:28.640> kidding<00:06:29.240> me

but once this is cute are you kidding me
you're<00:06:30.560> gonna<00:06:30.710> get<00:06:30.860> sucked<00:06:31.130> up<00:06:31.310> in<00:06:31.460> the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
you're gonna get sucked up in the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.990 
you're gonna get sucked up in the
elevator

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
elevator

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.180 
elevator
yeah<00:06:32.540> you're<00:06:33.260> gonna<00:06:33.500> get<00:06:33.560> sucked<00:06:33.800> up<00:06:34.010> in<00:06:34.160> the

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
yeah you're gonna get sucked up in the

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.460 
yeah you're gonna get sucked up in the
elevator<00:06:34.669> alright<00:06:35.090> anyways<00:06:35.330> basically<00:06:35.600> what

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
elevator alright anyways basically what

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.250 
elevator alright anyways basically what
happens<00:06:36.830> is<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.340> don't<00:06:38.060> know<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:38.630> exact

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
happens is I don't know the exact

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.770 
happens is I don't know the exact
physics

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
physics

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.970 
physics
of<00:06:39.840> it<00:06:39.990> because<00:06:40.320> you<00:06:40.470> know<00:06:40.500> it's<00:06:40.710> not<00:06:40.830> really

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
of it because you know it's not really

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.600 
of it because you know it's not really
supposed<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.460> happen<00:06:41.639> in<00:06:41.940> Minecraft<00:06:42.450> but<00:06:43.050> um

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
supposed to happen in Minecraft but um

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.100 
supposed to happen in Minecraft but um
when<00:06:44.610> it<00:06:44.700> does<00:06:44.820> go<00:06:44.970> into<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.300> hopper<00:06:45.660> it<00:06:45.810> feeds

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
when it does go into the hopper it feeds

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.710 
when it does go into the hopper it feeds
into<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.770> dispenser<00:06:47.280> and<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:48.330> can<00:06:48.450> even<00:06:48.570> just

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
into the dispenser and you can even just

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.820 
into the dispenser and you can even just
put<00:06:48.900> stuff<00:06:48.990> in<00:06:49.169> the<00:06:49.230> dispenser<00:06:49.650> there's

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
put stuff in the dispenser there's

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.820 
put stuff in the dispenser there's
really<00:06:49.919> no<00:06:50.100> point<00:06:50.400> then<00:06:50.840> but<00:06:51.840> the<00:06:52.350> redstone

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
really no point then but the redstone

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.170 
really no point then but the redstone
will<00:06:53.100> go<00:06:53.220> around<00:06:53.490> it'll<00:06:53.820> trigger<00:06:54.000> the

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
will go around it'll trigger the

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.090 
will go around it'll trigger the
dispenser<00:06:54.600> it'll<00:06:54.900> go<00:06:55.050> through<00:06:55.230> the<00:06:55.350> water<00:06:55.560> it

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
dispenser it'll go through the water it

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.070 
dispenser it'll go through the water it
will<00:06:56.340> hit<00:06:56.490> this<00:06:56.610> area<00:06:56.970> here<00:06:57.330> and<00:06:57.480> for<00:06:57.900> some

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
will hit this area here and for some

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.870 
will hit this area here and for some
reason<00:06:58.440> the<00:06:58.740> fences<00:06:59.130> just<00:06:59.460> shoot<00:06:59.669> it<00:06:59.760> up

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
reason the fences just shoot it up

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.000 
reason the fences just shoot it up
through<00:07:00.150> the<00:07:00.240> glass<00:07:00.540> and<00:07:00.840> then<00:07:01.560> it<00:07:01.650> comes<00:07:01.860> up

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
through the glass and then it comes up

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.670 
through the glass and then it comes up
at<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.190> top<00:07:02.550> so<00:07:02.850> anything<00:07:03.840> you<00:07:03.930> throw<00:07:04.139> into

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
at the top so anything you throw into

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.670 
at the top so anything you throw into
the<00:07:05.520> dispenser<00:07:06.060> like<00:07:06.660> so<00:07:06.960> will<00:07:07.410> see<00:07:07.590> the

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
the dispenser like so will see the
