00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.460
 functionality you can be by 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.220

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.500
 once again we have to wait for a 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 A little bit here, I only have these 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.740
 features but depending on the 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.510
 program that you install it can 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.000
 increase functionality here with 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.470
 Which I said increase for news is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.820
 facebook twitter and any for example 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.530

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.830

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.340
 go out then the staff I 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.609
 I decided to make this video to show 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.660
 how is this functionality because I 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.450

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.250
 explained at all and already speaks the 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.740
 Who wants to speak until 1 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.720
 expletive jair not explained the way 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.920
 none and I was even half revolted 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.270
 precarious but I want to know how 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.300
 this works 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.280
 I went back li and saw how it works 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.500
 I tested it, I said yes, that's how I 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.720
 It works and then I'm showing it to 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.790

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.470

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.230

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.900
