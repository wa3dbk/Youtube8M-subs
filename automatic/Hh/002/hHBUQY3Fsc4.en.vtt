control over this I mean there's a
there's<00:02:53.379> something<00:02:53.709> called<00:02:53.799> sbsettings<00:02:54.549> on

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
there's something called sbsettings on

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000 
there's something called sbsettings on
jailbroken<00:02:55.629> devices<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.349> give<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.590> sort<00:02:56.859> of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
jailbroken devices that give you sort of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.059 
jailbroken devices that give you sort of
this<00:02:57.359> not<00:02:58.359> as<00:02:58.510> clean<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.590> they<00:02:59.709> give<00:02:59.859> you<00:02:59.920> more

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
features so you can turn Wi-Fi on not

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.690 
features so you can turn Wi-Fi on not
quick<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.409> can<00:03:02.439> turn<00:03:02.620> 3g<00:03:02.889> on<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:03.340> off<00:03:03.430> quick

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
quick you can turn 3g on and off quick

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.149 
quick you can turn 3g on and off quick
so<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.420> they<00:03:04.569> make<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.870> customizable<00:03:05.409> that'd

you<00:04:04.180> could<00:04:04.359> print<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.199> that's<00:04:05.769> really<00:04:05.979> pretty

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
you could print and that's really pretty

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.289 
you could print and that's really pretty
easy<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.430> select<00:04:06.729> the<00:04:06.790> printer<00:04:07.030> although<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
easy you select the printer although a

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.969 
easy you select the printer although a
lot<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.750> printers<00:04:08.139> aren't<00:04:08.290> supported<00:04:08.859> at<00:04:08.949> this

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
lot of printers aren't supported at this

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.280 
lot of printers aren't supported at this
point<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:09.459> look<00:04:09.970> for<00:04:10.120> people<00:04:10.329> to<00:04:10.479> fix<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.199> in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
point but look for people to fix that in

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.229 
point but look for people to fix that in
the<00:04:11.349> future<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.370> change<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.790> number<00:04:13.209> of

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
the future you can change the number of

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.229 
the future you can change the number of
copies<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:14.669> then<00:04:15.669> you<00:04:15.819> can<00:04:15.940> go<00:04:16.060> ahead<00:04:16.090> and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
copies and then you can go ahead and

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.849 
copies and then you can go ahead and
print<00:04:16.510> which<00:04:16.599> is<00:04:16.720> pretty<00:04:16.840> useful<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.409> that's

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
print which is pretty useful and that's

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.610 
print which is pretty useful and that's
in<00:04:18.690> mail<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.620> also<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:22.659> web<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.529> you

going to need to print analog things
from<00:04:37.720> now<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.110> again<00:04:38.349> you're<00:04:38.800> still<00:04:39.039> going<00:04:39.190> to

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
from now and again you're still going to

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.159 
from now and again you're still going to

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.059 
need to project it for a lot of people
to<00:04:41.379> see<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.979> now<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.370> can<00:04:42.610> do<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:42.909> wirelessly

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
to see and now we can do that wirelessly

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.770 
to see and now we can do that wirelessly
really<00:04:45.069> pretty<00:04:45.310> easily<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:46.000> multitask

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
really pretty easily and multitask

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.080 
really pretty easily and multitask
between<00:04:47.110> ass<00:04:47.319> which<00:04:47.560> makes<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.889> really<00:04:48.069> a<00:04:48.580> nice

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
between ass which makes it really a nice

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.290 
between ass which makes it really a nice
little<00:04:49.750> touch<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.699> reason<00:04:51.849> why<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.060> is

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
little touch so the reason why this is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.140 
little touch so the reason why this is
critical<00:04:52.750> again<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:53.650> reiterate<00:04:54.150> business

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
critical again to reiterate business
