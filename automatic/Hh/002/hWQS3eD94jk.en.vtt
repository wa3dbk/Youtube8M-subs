00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
review having a Curt talk about what the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.360 
review having a Curt talk about what the
bike<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.410> more<00:00:07.710> people<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.069> said<00:00:08.220> about

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
bike is like more people are said about

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.629 
bike is like more people are said about
them<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.670> past<00:00:08.940> but<00:00:09.420> anyway<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.929> first<00:00:10.639> one

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
them in the past but anyway my first one

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.980 
them in the past but anyway my first one
my<00:00:11.759> first<00:00:11.969> impression<00:00:12.360> well<00:00:12.480> they<00:00:12.630> call<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.840> an

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
my first impression well they call it an

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.839 
my first impression well they call it an
oil<00:00:13.139> called<00:00:13.469> engine<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
oil called engine but it's not really is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.670 
oil called engine but it's not really is
it<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.630> an<00:00:15.780> air-cooled<00:00:16.139> engine<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.619> a

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it it's an air-cooled engine with a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.160 
it it's an air-cooled engine with a
larger<00:00:16.980> oil<00:00:17.070> cooler<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.869> not<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.020> going

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
larger oil cooler and not was going

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
larger oil cooler and not was going
wrong<00:00:22.350> without<00:00:22.650> an<00:00:22.800> air-cooled<00:00:23.130> engine<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
wrong without an air-cooled engine is a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.750 
wrong without an air-cooled engine is a
more<00:00:23.850> robust<00:00:24.240> kind<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.689> thing<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.760> will

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
more robust kind of a thing and will

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.839 
more robust kind of a thing and will
last<00:00:26.910> much<00:00:27.240> longer<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.750> course<00:00:28.519> never<00:00:29.519> having

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
last much longer of course never having

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.959 
last much longer of course never having
any<00:00:30.000> cooling<00:00:30.810> problems<00:00:31.520> these<00:00:32.520> brand<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
any cooling problems these brand is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.459 
any cooling problems these brand is
nearly<00:00:33.239> always<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:33.750> handlebars<00:00:34.170> on

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
nearly always get these handlebars on

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
nearly always get these handlebars on
there<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.860> sort<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.180> sporty<00:00:36.180> sort<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> bars

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
there these sort of sporty sort of bars

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
there these sort of sporty sort of bars
and<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> sporty<00:00:37.469> exhaust<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.600> they<00:00:39.600> do

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and a sporty exhaust on them they do

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
and a sporty exhaust on them they do
really<00:00:39.989> need<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.559> magnets<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:40.980> more

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
really need that the magnets are more

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
really need that the magnets are more
fun<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> ride<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> standard

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
fun to ride because with that standard

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.650 
fun to ride because with that standard
exhaust<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> sort<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.660> quiet

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
exhaust it is so kind of sort of quiet

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.060 
exhaust it is so kind of sort of quiet
is<00:00:45.930> sort<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> boring<00:00:47.250> side

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.400 

so

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.190 

it<00:00:55.410> sounds<00:00:55.740> sort<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.950> quite<00:00:56.190> sort<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.490> racy<00:00:57.200> and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
it sounds sort of quite sort of racy and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.630 
it sounds sort of quite sort of racy and
to<00:00:58.560> what<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.830> thing's<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.310> made<00:00:59.460> these

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to what this thing's up there made these

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.330 
to what this thing's up there made these
things<00:00:59.850> rough<00:01:00.030> years<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.870> here's<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
things rough years this one here's a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.930 
things rough years this one here's a
1996<00:01:03.440> they<00:01:04.440> all<00:01:04.650> seem<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.460> tinkered<00:01:05.910> with

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
1996 they all seem to get tinkered with

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.340 
1996 they all seem to get tinkered with
all<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.300> extra<00:01:06.600> bits<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.050> sort<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
all these extra bits like this sort of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.200 
all these extra bits like this sort of
chrome<00:01:07.650> radiator<00:01:07.890> covers<00:01:08.670> none<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.880> kind

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
chrome radiator covers none of that kind

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.530 
chrome radiator covers none of that kind
of<00:01:09.330> subtle<00:01:09.600> stuff<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:11.060> mean<00:01:12.060> anyway<00:01:12.360> they're

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
of subtle stuff I mean anyway they're

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.180 
of subtle stuff I mean anyway they're
cheap<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.290> buy<00:01:13.410> these<00:01:13.470> things<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
cheap now you can buy these things for

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.130 
cheap now you can buy these things for
well<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> ones<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.420> worth<00:01:15.660> about

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.300 

thousand<00:01:19.140> pounds<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.619> something<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thousand pounds is something like that I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
thousand pounds is something like that I
suppose<00:01:21.530> 1,200<00:01:22.530> pounds<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.080> an

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
suppose 1,200 pounds and you go an

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.900 
suppose 1,200 pounds and you go an
electric<00:01:25.500> meaty<00:01:25.740> bike<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.280> whatever<00:01:26.610> people

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
electric meaty bike but whatever people

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.570 
electric meaty bike but whatever people
say<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> done<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.800> buy<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> bike<00:01:29.399> and

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
say is that done they buy the bike and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.219 
say is that done they buy the bike and
it<00:01:29.759> isn't<00:01:29.910> really<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> touring<00:01:30.660> bike<00:01:30.869> isn't

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it isn't really a touring bike isn't

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
it isn't really a touring bike isn't
really<00:01:31.410> sports<00:01:31.770> bike<00:01:32.130> isn't<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.850> anything

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really sports bike isn't really anything

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.639 
really sports bike isn't really anything
sort<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.660> really<00:01:34.050> it's<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.350> sort<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
sort of like really it's that sort of

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.340 
sort of like really it's that sort of
in-between<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.119> perhaps<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.720> suited<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
in-between so perhaps more suited to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
in-between so perhaps more suited to
people<00:01:37.649> who<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:37.770> ride<00:01:38.100> too<00:01:38.369> much<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:39.330> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
people who don't ride too much not a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
people who don't ride too much not a
specialist<00:01:39.990> rider<00:01:40.259> some<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
specialist rider some you just like a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
specialist rider some you just like a
bit<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.840> half<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.110> day<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.410> on<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.590> bike<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:45.649> do

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bit of a half a day out on the bike I do

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.609 
bit of a half a day out on the bike I do
do<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> GT<00:01:47.820> version<00:01:48.060> where<00:01:48.479> their<00:01:48.690> luggage<00:01:49.289> on

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
do a GT version where their luggage on

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
do a GT version where their luggage on
there<00:01:49.800> probably<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.310> make<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.580> reasonable

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
there probably then make a reasonable

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
there probably then make a reasonable
touring<00:01:51.420> bike<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.190> one<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
touring bike and the one with the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.950 
touring bike and the one with the
fairing<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.090> makes<00:01:54.300> perhaps<00:01:54.539> are<00:01:54.690> something

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
fairing on makes perhaps are something

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.570 
fairing on makes perhaps are something
better<00:01:55.110> commuter<00:01:55.619> maybe<00:01:58.310> they're<00:01:59.310> quite<00:01:59.549> a

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
better commuter maybe they're quite a
