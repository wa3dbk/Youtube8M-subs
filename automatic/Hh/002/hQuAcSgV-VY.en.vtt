00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
really really slow so he you can just

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
really really slow so he you can just

actually you can record this voiceover
using<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> phone<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.390> quite

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
using the phone which is actually quite

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.700 
using the phone which is actually quite
funny<00:01:07.729> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> funny<00:01:09.119> idea<00:01:09.689> no<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.680> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
funny is a funny idea no you can just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
funny is a funny idea no you can just
take<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.220> phone<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.549> record<00:01:12.450> some

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
take your phone and record some

take your phone and record some
voiceovers<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:14.159> slow<00:01:14.729> motion<00:01:15.090> videos

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
voiceovers for your slow motion videos

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
voiceovers for your slow motion videos
because<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.220> any<00:01:17.460> sound<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
because you don't get any sound on the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
because you don't get any sound on the
slow-motion<00:01:18.990> video<00:01:19.640> since<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:22.070> basically

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
slow-motion video since it's basically

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
slow-motion video since it's basically
impossible<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.570> record<00:01:24.960> sound

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
impossible you can just record sound

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
impossible you can just record sound
when<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.100> slow<00:01:26.610> motion<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.970> not

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
when you have like slow motion it's not

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
when you have like slow motion it's not
possible<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.220> record<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> Sun

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
possible but you can record the Sun

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.899 
possible but you can record the Sun
afterwards<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.170> perhaps<00:01:31.860> he<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> even<00:01:32.610> put

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
afterwards and perhaps he can even put

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.590 
afterwards and perhaps he can even put
some<00:01:33.090> music<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.439> perhaps<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.280> can't

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
some music on it but perhaps you can't

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.399 
some music on it but perhaps you can't
because<00:01:36.650> perhaps<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
because perhaps you can only do the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
because perhaps you can only do the
sound<00:01:40.950> recording<00:01:41.729> using<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.240> microphone

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
sound recording using the microphone

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.190 
sound recording using the microphone
from<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> phone<00:01:43.909> I'm<00:01:44.909> actually<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.899> totally

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
from the phone I'm actually not totally

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
from the phone I'm actually not totally
sure<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.189> recording<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.149> voice<00:01:48.180> right

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
sure that it's recording my voice right

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.590 
sure that it's recording my voice right
now<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> hope<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.710> doing<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> because

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
now I hope it's doing it because

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
now I hope it's doing it because
otherwise<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:53.189> wasted<00:01:53.460> two

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
otherwise that at the have wasted two

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.410 
otherwise that at the have wasted two
minutes<00:01:55.399> doing<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.820> being<00:01:57.180> sure

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
minutes doing this or not being sure

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
minutes doing this or not being sure
that<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.750> recordings<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.920> anyways<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.490> is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that it's recordings but anyways this is

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.840 
that it's recordings but anyways this is
reaction<00:02:00.390> fact<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> same

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
reaction fact you can see the same

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.850 
reaction fact you can see the same
