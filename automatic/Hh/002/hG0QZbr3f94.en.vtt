00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
this to it with two seater calls so far

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.990 
this to it with two seater calls so far
but<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.530> mean<00:01:00.770> that<00:01:00.950> might<00:01:01.130> just<00:01:01.340> been<00:01:01.489> on<00:01:01.850> our

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
but I mean that might just been on our

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.060 
but I mean that might just been on our
method<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.660> mean<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.110> could<00:01:03.440> possibly<00:01:03.739> be

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
method I mean this could possibly be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.490 
method I mean this could possibly be
done<00:01:04.280> with<00:01:04.460> 4c<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.939> cars<00:01:05.119> as<00:01:05.269> well<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:05.780> I'm<00:01:06.050> no

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
done with 4c of cars as well but I'm no

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.050 
done with 4c of cars as well but I'm no
