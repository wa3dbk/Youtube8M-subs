cables thank asus has been doing this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.389 
cables thank asus has been doing this
for<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.990> while<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> great<00:01:55.799> idea

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
for a while and this is a great idea

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.800 
for a while and this is a great idea
you<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.850> plug<00:01:57.030> everything<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you just plug everything in here and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
you just plug everything in here and
then<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> maybe<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.920> some

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
then if you want to maybe make some

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.350 
then if you want to maybe make some
changes<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.490> something<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> unplug<00:02:00.240> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
changes or something you unplug this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
changes or something you unplug this
entire<00:02:00.659> thing<00:02:00.930> instead<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.259> having<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> replug

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
entire thing instead of having to replug

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.530 
entire thing instead of having to replug
in<00:02:02.460> everything<00:02:02.759> else<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.119> makes<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in everything else it also makes it a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.490 
in everything else it also makes it a
lot<00:02:03.570> easier<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.110> trying<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> work

right<00:04:33.050> now<00:04:33.500> let's<00:04:33.710> talk<00:04:33.830> about<00:04:33.889> what<00:04:34.190> you're

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
right now let's talk about what you're

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.619 
right now let's talk about what you're
gonna<00:04:34.400> plug<00:04:34.610> into<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:34.940> system<00:04:35.300> up<00:04:35.449> here<00:04:35.479> at

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
gonna plug into this system up here at

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:36.909 
gonna plug into this system up here at
the<00:04:35.720> top<00:04:35.930> let's<00:04:36.169> come<00:04:36.349> on<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.710> take<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.860> look

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the top let's come on in and take a look

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.589 
the top let's come on in and take a look
at<00:04:37.099> the<00:04:37.159> RAM<00:04:37.340> slots<00:04:37.699> here<00:04:37.879> there<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.449> see

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
at the RAM slots here there you can see

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.260 
at the RAM slots here there you can see
it<00:04:38.659> uses<00:04:38.780> ddr2<00:04:39.490> which<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.639> still<00:04:40.849> the<00:04:40.970> most

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
it uses ddr2 which is still the most

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.850 
it uses ddr2 which is still the most
cost-effective<00:04:41.810> way<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:42.349> guys

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
cost-effective way to go guys

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.350 
cost-effective way to go guys
sure<00:04:43.340> what<00:04:43.460> anybody<00:04:43.729> says<00:04:43.940> I'll<00:04:44.090> punch<00:04:44.330> them

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
sure what anybody says I'll punch them

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.210 
sure what anybody says I'll punch them
alright<00:04:45.229> move<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.620> over<00:04:45.770> here<00:04:45.919> let's<00:04:46.069> take<00:04:46.159> a

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
alright move on over here let's take a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.279 
alright move on over here let's take a
look<00:04:46.370> at<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.490> SATA<00:04:46.699> again<00:04:47.449> everybody's

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
look at the SATA again everybody's

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.629 
look at the SATA again everybody's
moving<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.710> back<00:04:48.889> of<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.129> board<00:04:49.310> which<00:04:49.520> is

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
moving to the back of the board which is

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.980 
moving to the back of the board which is
something<00:04:49.879> I<00:04:50.030> really<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.629> have<00:04:50.720> six

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
something I really like you have six

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.420 
something I really like you have six
SATA<00:04:51.169> ports<00:04:51.470> there<00:04:51.590> on<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.770> back<00:04:51.949> and<00:04:52.250> on

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
SATA ports there on the back and on

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.860 
SATA ports there on the back and on
board<00:04:52.879> raid<00:04:53.090> 0<00:04:53.870> raid<00:04:53.960> 1<00:04:54.169> 0+1<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.490> rate<00:04:55.639> 5<00:04:55.970> all

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
board raid 0 raid 1 0+1 and rate 5 all

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.129 
board raid 0 raid 1 0+1 and rate 5 all
there<00:04:57.759> alright<00:04:58.759> moving<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.240> down<00:04:59.509> here<00:04:59.810> let's

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
there alright moving on down here let's

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.050 
there alright moving on down here let's
go<00:05:00.229> over<00:05:00.409> the<00:05:00.530> gloss<00:05:00.740> over<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.129> floppy<00:05:01.819> and

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
go over the gloss over the floppy and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.059 
go over the gloss over the floppy and
the<00:05:02.150> IDE<00:05:02.389> and<00:05:02.479> all<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.900> sort<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.110> thing<00:05:03.259> now

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
the IDE and all that sort of thing now

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.480 
the IDE and all that sort of thing now
take<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.280> look<00:05:04.430> at<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.840> four<00:05:05.840> PCI<00:05:06.680> Express<00:05:07.009> 16

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
take a look at this four PCI Express 16

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.369 
take a look at this four PCI Express 16
speed<00:05:07.729> slots<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.090> these<00:05:08.210> are<00:05:08.330> these<00:05:08.569> are<00:05:08.629> 2.0

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
speed slots and these are these are 2.0

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.110 
speed slots and these are these are 2.0
so<00:05:10.039> you<00:05:10.129> get<00:05:10.250> double<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.490> bandwidth<00:05:10.909> for

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
so you get double the bandwidth for

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.140 
so you get double the bandwidth for
those<00:05:12.159> right<00:05:13.159> now<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.580> works<00:05:13.729> with<00:05:13.909> triose

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
those right now it works with triose

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.580 
those right now it works with triose
that<00:05:14.389> line<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:14.659> each<00:05:14.750> one<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.020> these<00:05:15.110> works<00:05:15.379> at

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
that line and each one of these works at

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.399 
that line and each one of these works at
16<00:05:16.039> speed<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.789> last<00:05:17.000> one<00:05:17.240> runs<00:05:17.840> at<00:05:17.960> 8<00:05:18.139> speed

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
16 speed the last one runs at 8 speed

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.709 
16 speed the last one runs at 8 speed
what's<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.430> last<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:19.849> use<00:05:19.940> for<00:05:19.969> I<00:05:20.389> don't

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
what's the last one you use for I don't

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:21.879 
what's the last one you use for I don't
think<00:05:20.900> I'm<00:05:20.960> allowed<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.169> tell<00:05:21.349> anybody<00:05:21.590> I'll

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
think I'm allowed to tell anybody I'll

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:22.420 
think I'm allowed to tell anybody I'll
get<00:05:22.009> in<00:05:22.099> trouble

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
get in trouble

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.520 
get in trouble
I'll<00:05:22.580> get<00:05:22.669> my<00:05:22.789> pants<00:05:23.060> suit<00:05:23.210> off<00:05:23.330> again<00:05:23.599> you

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
I'll get my pants suit off again you

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.930 
I'll get my pants suit off again you
have<00:05:24.620> one<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:24.949> PCI<00:05:25.250> slots<00:05:25.610> there<00:05:25.789> if<00:05:25.879> you

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
have one of the PCI slots there if you

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.149 
have one of the PCI slots there if you
want<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.150> run<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.530> something<00:05:27.530> else<00:05:27.650> like<00:05:27.830> maybe

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
want to run a something else like maybe

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:29.920 
want to run a something else like maybe
a<00:05:28.279> physics<00:05:28.639> card<00:05:28.880> or<00:05:29.240> something<00:05:29.719> like<00:05:29.840> that

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
a physics card or something like that

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.420 
a physics card or something like that
you<00:05:30.110> can<00:05:30.199> install<00:05:30.469> it<00:05:30.560> there<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:31.069> we<00:05:31.190> have<00:05:31.279> two

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
you can install it there and we have two

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.070 
you can install it there and we have two
of<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.580> one<00:05:31.729> speed<00:05:31.969> PCI<00:05:32.300> Express<00:05:32.569> slots<00:05:32.900> and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
of the one speed PCI Express slots and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.409 
of the one speed PCI Express slots and
of<00:05:33.680> course<00:05:33.889> you're<00:05:34.039> gonna<00:05:34.159> use<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:34.880> one

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
of course you're gonna use this in one

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.110 
of course you're gonna use this in one
of<00:05:35.539> them<00:05:35.630> so<00:05:36.050> that'll<00:05:36.380> leave<00:05:36.680> one<00:05:37.099> open<00:05:37.370> take<00:05:38.090> a

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
of them so that'll leave one open take a

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.350 
of them so that'll leave one open take a
look<00:05:38.270> at<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.389> back<00:05:38.599> here<00:05:38.900> it's<00:05:39.800> loaded<00:05:40.400> we

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
look at the back here it's loaded we

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.939 
look at the back here it's loaded we
have<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.479> dual<00:05:41.870> Gigabit<00:05:42.500> Ethernet

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
have a dual Gigabit Ethernet

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.170 
have a dual Gigabit Ethernet
one<00:05:43.130> could<00:05:43.279> be<00:05:43.340> incoming<00:05:43.789> one<00:05:43.940> can<00:05:44.090> be

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
one could be incoming one can be

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180 
one could be incoming one can be
outgoing<00:05:44.479> so<00:05:44.870> that's<00:05:45.080> kind<00:05:45.319> of<00:05:45.349> cool<00:05:45.409> we<00:05:46.069> have

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
outgoing so that's kind of cool we have

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.879 
outgoing so that's kind of cool we have
four<00:05:47.060> USB<00:05:47.270> 2.0<00:05:47.900> here<00:05:48.080> two<00:05:48.349> more<00:05:48.529> right<00:05:48.710> here

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
four USB 2.0 here two more right here

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.950 
four USB 2.0 here two more right here
making<00:05:49.130> six<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.550> total<00:05:49.669> on<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:49.969> back<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.599> you

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
making six in total on the back and you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.209 
making six in total on the back and you
can<00:05:51.080> plug<00:05:51.319> in<00:05:51.469> them<00:05:51.590> several<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.009> front

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
can plug in them several to the front

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.519 
can plug in them several to the front
think<00:05:52.370> there's<00:05:52.520> over<00:05:52.729> 10<00:05:52.940> in<00:05:53.090> total<00:05:53.440> we<00:05:54.440> have

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.529 
think there's over 10 in total we have

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.769 
think there's over 10 in total we have
eSATA<00:05:54.889> onboard<00:05:55.580> two<00:05:55.789> of<00:05:55.879> those<00:05:56.000> so<00:05:56.599> we<00:05:56.690> have

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
eSATA onboard two of those so we have

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.019 
eSATA onboard two of those so we have
eSATA<00:05:57.139> and<00:05:57.379> we<00:05:57.440> also<00:05:57.590> have<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:57.979> extra<00:05:58.520> card

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
eSATA and we also have the extra card

this<00:06:15.289> just<00:06:15.620> doesn't<00:06:15.949> matter<00:06:16.099> for<00:06:16.340> speed

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
this just doesn't matter for speed

this<00:06:40.610> thing<00:06:40.850> sounds<00:06:41.120> a<00:06:41.180> lot<00:06:41.300> better<00:06:41.360> than

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
this thing sounds a lot better than

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.080 
this thing sounds a lot better than
regular<00:06:42.170> onboard<00:06:42.740> audio<00:06:42.860> it's<00:06:43.160> not<00:06:43.310> quite<00:06:43.820> as

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
regular onboard audio it's not quite as

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.470 
regular onboard audio it's not quite as
nice<00:06:44.870> as<00:06:45.200> a<00:06:45.230> actual<00:06:46.190> x5<00:06:46.820> card<00:06:47.090> but<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.330> does

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
nice as a actual x5 card but it does

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.390 
nice as a actual x5 card but it does
sound<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.780> lot<00:06:48.080> better<00:06:48.470> than<00:06:48.920> the<00:06:49.010> onboard

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
sound a lot better than the onboard

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.030 
sound a lot better than the onboard
audio<00:06:49.520> so<00:06:49.850> it's<00:06:49.970> a<00:06:50.030> huge<00:06:50.270> step<00:06:50.450> forward<00:06:50.750> and

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
audio so it's a huge step forward and

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.990 
audio so it's a huge step forward and
people<00:06:52.040> that<00:06:52.100> get<00:06:52.250> this<00:06:52.400> they<00:06:52.520> probably<00:06:52.700> won't

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
people that get this they probably won't

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.310 
people that get this they probably won't
