00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello my name is ivan 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.500
 A. Karpenko 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.889
 The theme of our video is cognition as 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.809
 activity is about such 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.930
 human ability as knowledge 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 the world around it can be called a kind 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 specific activity 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.590
 human understanding 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 reflection in the consciousness of the surrounding 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 Really really three 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 man is characterized by knowledge 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.930
 cognitive attitude to the world in what 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.320
 it lies it is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 what the person wants to know how it works 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 world 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 he wants to understand the laws which he obeys 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.660
 world he wants to understand himself that is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 the main purpose of knowledge is to find 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 self unloading world understand 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 how is the world governed like it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.829
 there is why there is what is it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 meaning if this meaning is there at all 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 there is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.490
 since ancient times the most ancient times since 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 how mythology and philosophy originated 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 man tries to understand the world around 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.119
 to find your place in it and understand 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 myself 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.229
 that is, this knowledge in general 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.040
 completely natural 2 activities and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.460
 in some 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 some sense even necessary yes and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 justifying the existence of man 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.119
 knowledge may be different may be 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.030
 various classifications in this case 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.329
 we are talking about the following types of knowledge 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.820
 which we are now in brief 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.229
 we list and analyze first speech 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 talking about everyday knowledge yes maybe 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.549
 artistic knowledge 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 maybe scientific knowledge maybe 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.540
 philosophical knowledge can be 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
 religious knowledge well and in the end 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.969
 there may be mythological knowledge in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.189
 In principle, there is no sense in Garanichev with these 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.259
 types of knowledge can be further 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.009
 continue 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.450
 new species 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.950
 on the knowledge of voicing well there is no 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.819
 urgent need in principle you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.110
 will see later on in the process and 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.530
 studying social studies here 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.939
 kinds of knowledge are bass 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.069
 some confusion at this causes 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.900
 such a category as everyday knowledge 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.480
 not what it means and some not even 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.489
 want to agree some zabituy 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.230
 agents yes not from teachers they 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.079
 want to accept what kind of knowledge 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.859
 There is I will explain in what matter not 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:44.010
 there were misunderstandings everyday knowledge 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:47.579
 this is the knowledge which are formed in 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.389
 during the daily life of a person during 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.150
 his daily household activities 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.370
 every person lives up to in the surrounding 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.190
 the world of interaction with other people 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.400
 encounter does not acquire some 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.590
 everyday experience this everyday experience 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 relationships with the outside world and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.659
 makes up the contents of the ordinary 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.840
 knowledge of the world, respectively 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.940
 scientific knowledge has another specificity 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.069
 Yes, and other characteristics 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.139
 scientific knowledge is knowledge which 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.959
 based on some special 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.180
 attitude to the surrounding reality 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 yes not on common sense not on 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.780
 everyday experience 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.160
 experience interacting with other people a 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.169
 on some methods mechanisms ways 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 knowledge of the surrounding world which 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.099
 basically have 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.889
 rational knowledge rational 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.090
 empire attitude and experience 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.530
 experiment up a series of scientific method and 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.090
 countries specific environmental attitudes 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.790
 really form the basis 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.630
 scientific knowledge examples of scientific 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.670
 knowledge is knowledge 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.760
 the world through physics chemistry biology 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.110
 so on yes and various other sciences 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.440
 There is their specificity in contrast to 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.780
 routine knowledge and pressure on the method 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.510
 given a certain scientific method 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.190
 on some specific ways 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.120
 relations of reality 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.550
 so can cognition be philosophical 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.110
 which focuses on knowledge 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.660
 some abstract categories 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.060
 knowledge can be artistic this 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 knowledge of the world through the works 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.770
 art through creativity is a kind 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.410
 emotional experience sensual 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.020
 experiencing the surrounding reality 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.930
 knowledge may be religious at the end 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.500
 all religious knowledge but founded 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.820
 on faith as you perfectly understand on 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.350
 belief in some supernatural 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.210
 properties of the world in his no 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.270
 supernatural based belief in 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.820
 creations into the existence of god and others 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.940
 on from natural forces to which stand 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.220
 above man and govern all such 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.140
 knowledge can also be about which she 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.290
 may be for example reading 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.790
 tanking of sacred texts so on 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.800
 still see that knowledge can be very 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.980
 once it can be rational 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.450
 scientific path it may be 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.110
 irrational it may be 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.480
 mystical way is not important in 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.950
 in this case we are with you in this case 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.020
 not trying to say that some way 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.590
 rather we just want to say 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.620
 with you that does not exist very much 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.960
 various ways cognitive actions 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.460
 person it shows and proves 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.400
 once again what a person needs 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.370
 gain knowledge one way or another in 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.270
 the world around us to find answers to those 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.580
 questions that you worry about like this
