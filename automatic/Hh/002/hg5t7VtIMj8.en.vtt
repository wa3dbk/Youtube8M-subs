I read with one eye and then I see

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
I read with one eye and then I see
distance<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.240> takes<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
distance with the other it takes a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.670 
distance with the other it takes a
little<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.020> getting<00:01:16.170> used<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.650> first

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
little bit of getting used to at first

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.210 
little bit of getting used to at first
but<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.700> terrible<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.320> found<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but it's not terrible so I found that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
but it's not terrible so I found that
maybe<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.479> restaurant<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
maybe if it's like the restaurant is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
maybe if it's like the restaurant is
dark<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.070> late<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.369> night<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:23.850> eyes

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
dark or it's late at night or my eyes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
dark or it's late at night or my eyes
are<00:01:24.210> tired<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.750> maybe<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.470> readers

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
are tired then maybe I need the readers

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.890 
are tired then maybe I need the readers
but<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.759> need<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> way<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> used<00:01:27.780> to
