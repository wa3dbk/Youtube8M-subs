00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.010
 Starting to eat adventure to dental seven seas 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.769
 hey 3 pieces go- no secret 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.060
 After all , let's be two years with pie 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 Akane is from my nice summer 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.640
 Parallel up lymph and volunteer south Marinpa say Paris 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:47.060
 I sleep in Minky etc. 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:51.470
 meme uh do 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:56.450
 I started to be interested in the scent 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:01.730
 About 2 years ago, I released an album called perfume in 8 summers 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:06.940
 It is meaning in Japanese that is perfume = perfume of maaha 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.000
 There is also to say Rutte have your work with a lot of voice 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.510
 Therefore I hooked on various scents 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.700
 Even if there is something like a refreshing scent, that's it 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.980
 In the sense that if you have a moody scent, please listen to my various voices 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.930
 I named it perfume 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:31.070
 Since then gradually interested in the things that gradually whopping without scent perfumes the first time Ponya 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.960
 But what happened as soon as we met this blue rose bottle 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.820
 Wow 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.710
 What smell paying the blue Kedomo I do nothing reason you are hooked in the belly separately by Hayashibara 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 I wonder what 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:49.020
 Step into the world of noise and traffic 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 This time I think about tea more closely while thinking closely to life while enjoying haori 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 I don't think there are anyone I don't know but I also like it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.730
 Well there are so many 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.880
 In particular 1 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.460
 This is it that the three points are similar tried to bring today 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.870
 Really sweet about Marco Polo's not let them Oikawa to sleep this say shame 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.310
 I smell good 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.900
 Kedomo this is we do and say, two land Ga' 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.670
 It looks like a key chain but leaves are included, but this also has a relatively sweet feel 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.030
 It's a good tea 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.100
 And I'm wondering it's called Cape Town 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.860
 This tea is better than tea Kinokawa 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.210
 But I So um 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:35.630
 There is no caffeine in it and it's good tea before going to bed at night 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.940
 I have an edge that can not be cut even with work 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.570
 Come home tired Well 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.660
 Even though it's also of course important to say full of 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:51.230
 For example , I have to do something in Gohei 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:56.030
 When you say you have to write a language or you have to write lyrics 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.150
 That's right where I'm sitting at the table in my room 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.730
 It does not move 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 It is really the smell that is quick to change the atmosphere of the moment 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.819
 I've put 1 cup of tea 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.280
 I think just the thing a little probably quite tight aroma than the accounts that you might think 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.390
 To it with one hand it to feel a whiff, such as the environment changes from I'd have to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.910
 While drinking 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:34.000
 So the next of me or spread also thought that was thought Nante thing Ann thing 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.600
 I'm by my side and heal my fatigue and help me change my mind 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.740
 Though 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.670
 Tea then perfume world aromatherapy 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.250
 Those things about the scent 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.250
 A place to say
