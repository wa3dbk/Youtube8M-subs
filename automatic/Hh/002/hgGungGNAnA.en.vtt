satellite l 505 very nice laptop

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.799 
satellite l 505 very nice laptop
basically<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> latest<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.150> greatest

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
basically the latest and greatest

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
basically the latest and greatest
as<00:00:16.139> far<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.470> processor<00:00:17.070> architecture<00:00:17.550> goes

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
as far as processor architecture goes

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359 
as far as processor architecture goes
it's<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> core<00:00:18.390> i3<00:00:18.740> which<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> 330

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
it's got the core i3 which is the 330

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
it's got the core i3 which is the 330
mobile<00:00:20.850> from<00:00:21.000> Intel<00:00:21.420> basically<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
mobile from Intel basically what that is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.460 
mobile from Intel basically what that is
is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.800> 2.1<00:00:23.369> 3<00:00:23.699> gigahertz<00:00:23.970> dual-core<00:00:24.720> processor

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is a 2.1 3 gigahertz dual-core processor

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
is a 2.1 3 gigahertz dual-core processor
it<00:00:25.590> actually<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.099> hyper-threading<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
it actually has hyper-threading so it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
it actually has hyper-threading so it
acts<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.570> four<00:00:28.050> core<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> quad

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
acts like four core like if it's a quad

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.999 
acts like four core like if it's a quad
core<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.880> also<00:00:30.179> features<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.410> turbo<00:00:31.800> mode

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
core it also features the turbo mode

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.209 
core it also features the turbo mode
which<00:00:32.189> overclocks<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> from<00:00:32.940> 2.13<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.930> 2.5<00:00:34.829> 3

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
which overclocks it from 2.13 to 2.5 3

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
which overclocks it from 2.13 to 2.5 3
gigahertz<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.880> itself<00:00:36.450> basically<00:00:36.960> an

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
gigahertz by itself basically an

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.600 
gigahertz by itself basically an
automatic<00:00:37.800> overclock<00:00:38.190> whenever<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
automatic overclock whenever the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.950 
automatic overclock whenever the
processor<00:00:39.090> detects<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> doing<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
processor detects it's doing a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
processor detects it's doing a
single-threaded<00:00:40.649> application<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.640> it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
single-threaded application or it's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.389 
single-threaded application or it's
loading<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> single-threaded<00:00:42.300> app<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.079> gonna

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
loading a single-threaded app it's gonna

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
loading a single-threaded app it's gonna
overclock<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.940> core<00:00:45.149> turn<00:00:45.450> off<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
overclock that one core turn off the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.299 
overclock that one core turn off the
second<00:00:46.079> core<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.829> that's<00:00:46.950> gonna<00:00:47.039> give<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
second core and that's gonna give you a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
second core and that's gonna give you a
nice<00:00:47.579> boost<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.969> performance<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.600> top<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
nice boost in performance on top of that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.250 
nice boost in performance on top of that
it's<00:00:49.469> very<00:00:49.559> efficient<00:00:50.039> suppose<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> 32<00:00:50.850> mm

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
it's very efficient suppose on the 32 mm

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's very efficient suppose on the 32 mm
manufacturing<00:00:52.260> process<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.800> means<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
manufacturing process which means it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
manufacturing process which means it
uses<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.699> less<00:00:53.760> battery<00:00:54.300> power<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.930> usual

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
uses a lot less battery power than usual

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
uses a lot less battery power than usual
on<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> desktop<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> doesn't<00:00:56.520> matter<00:00:56.640> you're

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
on a desktop it doesn't matter you're

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549 
on a desktop it doesn't matter you're
plugged<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.210> wall<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.199> care<00:00:58.440> about

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
plugged into a wall if you care about

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.660 
plugged into a wall if you care about
the<00:00:58.739> power<00:00:58.949> consumption<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.399> because

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the power consumption that's because

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.380 
the power consumption that's because
you're<00:00:59.850> trying<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you're trying to do it for the

you're trying to do it for the
environment<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
environment and you know good for you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.070 
environment and you know good for you
good<00:01:02.910> concerns<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> laptop<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> much

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
good concerns but on a laptop it's much

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
good concerns but on a laptop it's much
more<00:01:04.229> important<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.589> you're<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
more important because you're on a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
more important because you're on a
battery<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.270> battery<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> last

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

look at now first of all this is a 15.6

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
look at now first of all this is a 15.6
inch<00:01:25.290> laptop<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.790> does

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
inch laptop but as you will see it does

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
inch laptop but as you will see it does
have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.090> full<00:01:27.360> size<00:01:27.600> keyboard<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.439> has<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
have a full size keyboard and it has the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
have a full size keyboard and it has the
number<00:01:29.130> pad<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> side<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.210> number<00:01:30.450> pad<00:01:30.630> is

number pad on the side the number pad is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
number pad on the side the number pad is
probably<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> biggest<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.460> I've<00:01:32.579> seen<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
probably the biggest one I've seen on a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
probably the biggest one I've seen on a
60<00:01:33.150> point<00:01:33.299> 4<00:01:33.540> inch<00:01:33.659> notebook<00:01:33.840> they're<00:01:34.110> usually

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
60 point 4 inch notebook they're usually

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
60 point 4 inch notebook they're usually
slightly<00:01:35.070> thinner<00:01:35.400> keys<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.090> very

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
slightly thinner keys this one is very

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
slightly thinner keys this one is very
very<00:01:36.990> close<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> being<00:01:37.710> full<00:01:37.829> size<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> would

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
very close to being full size I would

port<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.850> hook<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.149> external<00:02:03.180> monitor<00:02:03.600> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
port to hook up an external monitor this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.100 
port to hook up an external monitor this
is<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.380> 10100<00:02:05.070> Ethernet<00:02:05.329> your<00:02:06.329> HDMI<00:02:06.810> port

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
is your 10100 Ethernet your HDMI port

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.859 
is your 10100 Ethernet your HDMI port
now<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.409> does<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.680> GMA<00:02:08.209> HD<00:02:09.209> graphics<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
now this does have GMA HD graphics in it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.559 
now this does have GMA HD graphics in it
so<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.860> HD<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.569> no<00:02:12.569> problem<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.290> also

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
so it will do HD out no problem you also

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.050 
so it will do HD out no problem you also
have<00:02:13.659> a<00:02:13.900> combo<00:02:14.379> USB<00:02:14.799> eSATA<00:02:15.219> drive<00:02:15.670> which<00:02:15.939> is
