00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it actually tones Herrin it's the first

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
it actually tones Herrin it's the first
shampoo<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.020> where<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> actually<00:00:52.860> leave

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
shampoo that where if I actually leave

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
shampoo that where if I actually leave
it<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.730> over<00:00:53.969> five<00:00:54.390> minutes<00:00:54.420> or

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it a little over five minutes or

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
it a little over five minutes or
something<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:56.340> leaves<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.760> almost
