00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.830
 what actually 4 k we want to briefly 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.650
 explain 4k the k stands for 1000 4.096 x 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.680
 2,160 pixels 4062 high the same applies 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 for ultra hd is just a bit narrow 38th 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.150
 40 instead of 4 690 hd is colloquially 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:30.420
 also referred to as 4k but uhd is just 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 38 40 instead of 496 and four in hd 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.079
 full hd sections rain dk so see 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
 much bigger 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 the ultra hd format compared to full hd 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.710
 What is this good for ? 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 an economic teeth compared to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 full hd left ultra hd also works 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 smaller displays still something 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.010
 detail sharpness and so does not need 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.899
 necessarily in 4k display a little more 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.510
 to enjoy detail sharpness 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 You can also choose individual sections 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.829
 if the whole project as a full hd 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 has issued later you can 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.870
 So win individual sections and so 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 in principle four full hd cameras 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.170
 reduce 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.380
 Of course you can also add later 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 zoom rides make digital succeed 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 nice clean or you do too 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 pans you then purely digital 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.590
 produced and produce so nice clean 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 you can make crooked horizons 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 straighten out later 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 all of this goes when you say the whole thing is full 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 hd has spent and as a base ultra hd 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.970
 uses or 4k here another example 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.360
 on the photokina here I have one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.520
 lumix fz100 tra hd yes I should 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.670
 I prefer to take pictures or film 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.649
 I decide for film and then can 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 subsequently by video single frame 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.500
 Taking it is also in-camera 8 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.729
 megapixel photos from this hd video 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.920
 So win a quite considerable 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.320
 picture size alone through film and single 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.830
 frame removal then 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.270
 as 8 megapixel jpeg photo here I have 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.300
 now a lumix g a 4 at 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.750
 bright 400 telephoto lens coupled 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.120
 and film here a kingfisher and also 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.240
 Here I take a video single frame 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.270
 and win with 1 8 megapixel jpeg 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.720
 foto here in 100% is enough for that 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.490
 I print a poster I try the whole 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.610
 and then print one more 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.680
 excerpt of it here in poster size and 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 hang the whole thing on the wall and if 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.910
 I'm told someone visits me in the office 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.550
 he always likes this is not a photo 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.860
 but a single frame from an ultra 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.870
 hd video and usually those are 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 Visitors really loved it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.110
 picture quality 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.760
 we consider again briefly together where to 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.060
 4k in 4k you can for example 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.340
 generate subsequent sections if 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.290
 you spent the project as hd 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.030
 the detail sharpness is on 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.100
 smaller displays HÃ¶rmann can 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.440
 nachdenke zoom rides or pans 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.680
 make or accidentally ship 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.950
 straightened stressed or too 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.970
 eight megapixel single photos by frame 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.840
 win withdrawal 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.730
 Africa is currently very exciting 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 does not use 4k display
