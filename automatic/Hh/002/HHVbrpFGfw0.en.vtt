 If I told you, you would not believe the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.070
 Armchairs face one of the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.950

 human came when another world 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.950

 Human is a chance of a lifetime to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.820
 child cheered when another human

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.320
 history bring the novelty today relatives 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.790

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.350
 And so it says look I want to go to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.579

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 a lot of people give up even going to see each other 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.250
 one thing 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 I've been here with you for ten 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.220
 years working with living 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.650
 sometimes the same thing if I win 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.540
 alone in the accumulated 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.159
 if I earn 20 billion reais 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.599
 accumulated in a juice will never solve 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.140
 this expansion expression that is being 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.629
 heard that there are people who 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.849
 which had legault not those produced in 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.590
 cpfl of responsibility and of course more 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.780
 when I heard that year's recalls series 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.060
 before last is you are around the country 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.760
 when the instructor hung up he had 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.639
 family that panicked and did not know 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.459
 what to do at night did not know that the whole 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:52.010
 relationship is mediated by electricity and 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.810
 Suddenly you had 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.189
 Ana's children , if they say the mother has no light. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.739
 that will make going to sleep and then wash 156 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:04.010
 human beings each with desire history 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.599
 dream project each with possibility 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.349
 to sing a little bit ready to do the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:15.769
 poetry tells the story of laughter and goes 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.930
 sleep one day 35 years ago in access to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.180
 My father arrived late on the afternoon of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 rang the horn of the parana jeep. 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.900
 he used a jeep at the time and when he 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.849
 He blew a trumpet Jeep we did 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.769
 that make every day people 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.169
 I would love to hug you 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.400
 children there was a time in the 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.319
 human history than when parents 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.209
 the children ran to the 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.060
 countries we rush to launch it with 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.609
 what purpose 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.780
 because we have a feeling of gratitude 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.370
 first run to hug and then 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.569
 complain about another brother 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.669
 We run because we had a 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.590
 feeling of gratitude that came from omd 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.760
 the fact that he worked in the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 sustained 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.109
 today attention in the world of the child the idea 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.299
 of gratitude 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.680
 was very scarce even that she 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.870
 so in the world of adults 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.329
 I rarely spoke, thank you, everything is 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.690
 your obligation would all be perfect 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.299
 now watch huh they were born own 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.590
 how come nobody is born ready have any 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.419
 strange thing in the middle 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.289
 something we have been building in the 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.950
 relations that also contaminated us and 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.180
 this contamination occurred in the idea that 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.650
 you are a server 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.570
 by the way 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.310
 parent and child relationships can be 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.050
 also remedied by the code of 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.720
 consumer is a provision of the service 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.240
 provision of service contract 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.250
 Look what a strange thing that day he 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.009
 arrived and when it arrived within a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.680
 big box in the jeep car he 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.509
 brought up here and by placing the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.900
 box when he opened what he had 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.400
 in with the black telephone and tva 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.220
 with the valve with the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.970
 way you should never have seen a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.190
 these are ours we would not be here 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.080
 look what an interesting thing that day 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.820
 From this day on our lives have changed. 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.280
 three major changes happening in 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.410
 The first of these would be the 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.889
 Come out, our lady appeared between the tv 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.889
 bank 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.050
 in this field the second change 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.639
 the armchairs face the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.460
 appliance 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.490
 the third change we did not talk 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.150
 more 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:32.090
 indeed could not nor should neighbor passed 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.110
 to be badly come another human happened to 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.300
 be heard 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.090
 another side got to continue 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.010
 with the appliance switched on 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.630
 there I watched the oral neighbor for the tv looked 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.570
 for him at the time he was also being 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.520
 when he gave the name of 2 and took 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.520
 although it would look as good as
