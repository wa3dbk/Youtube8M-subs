pretty<00:00:57.989> long<00:00:58.260> hair<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.940> probably<00:01:00.510> 8<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.870> 9

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
pretty long hair it's probably 8 or 9

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.740 
pretty long hair it's probably 8 or 9
inches<00:01:01.500> long<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.000> decided<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> get

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
inches long and so we decided to get

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.500 
inches long and so we decided to get
these<00:01:03.989> bigger<00:01:04.700> rods<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.390> she

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
these bigger rods here because she

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.340 
these bigger rods here because she
doesn't<00:01:06.780> want<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.189> super<00:01:08.189> tight<00:01:08.580> curl<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
doesn't want a super tight curl and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.789 
doesn't want a super tight curl and
hopefully<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.850> turn<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.299> tight

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
hopefully it doesn't turn out that tight

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.749 
hopefully it doesn't turn out that tight
and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.340> also<00:01:14.520> needed<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.270> the
