00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.279

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.279
 you can tell that 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.489
 It is also not important to be able to say good things to the dog 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.989
 zuzulegen still fix properly 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.229
 front and back 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.620
 and kept him out of the ostrich 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.210
 whether the intimate ones 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840
 it was not clear 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.630
 if they have a helper it is very important Infineon lose that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.230
 her hands 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 under the extremities 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.770
 and fixed his neck here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.110
 and here the under extreme deep and fix the pelvis that's the right one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.450
 Starting position that you can create, for example, associations or 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.450
 could do anything with her animal m 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.340
 we'll put on a bandage now, you need something attached 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.189
 danced here with the bandage not who socks then points again slips 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.410
 a man sticks have kick twice 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.700
 and then here is not just not the dogs 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.380
 hit what is important in a dead bandage is the first 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.010
 as standard, the odds with one with her 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.290
 and that's not his thing Rheine also gave Marc money 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.390
 so they do not give any indication 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.880
 not any 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 Cause injury 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.550
 that has put pressure on bands 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.690
 "It's very important to keep your fingers crossed for those who are not in the hit list 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.120
 submit to them 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.250
 do not forget you are here 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 I wait between these pull in a Kremser 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.940
 on the booming on this event the mud can be cleaned purified 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.730
 quoted Fritz Barth give 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.730
 and then they take one warns the bandage 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:12.729
 we know 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
 this dead one 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.480
 her task is now told to give this fod of shepherds to me 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.589
 to hold up a bit and hold against 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.939
 and then you can get here 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.519
 Know Vith 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.359
 very important in the dead of Qantas puts that sees the paws 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.439
 to go a way 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.829
 so that no so-called the lion fugte emergence 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.679
 that means what is accumulating down there on the liquid and she is waiting 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.839
 just clicked 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.809
 in 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.579
 Brink this procedure then 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 more 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.819
 what they can do then is with an elastic No let yourself 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.409
 the whole thing is something to take away 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.009
 harder to dictate one 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.129
 Circle also very important that they clarified before 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.239
 and then gangs 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.269
 dosed again 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.849
 the dead 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.049
 this is why it is too tight open-air events is why this will be handled directly 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.510
 To speak whole came to arrests that can then become a pressure bandage for the 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.219
 They do not want to do it 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.680
 that is very important that you can leave a bit JK the whole 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.199
 met again 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:40.989
 Now I want to St Cost point is here yes that's all important 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.650
 or that just fine that the kids first-aid kit in April 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.079
 that should always be there 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.620
 and at home you usually have a first aid cook before you get there 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:51.730
 to grab it
