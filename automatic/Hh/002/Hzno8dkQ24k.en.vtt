00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
purposes I've already installed one of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.990 
purposes I've already installed one of
the<00:00:30.510> side<00:00:30.720> arm<00:00:30.960> supports<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.790> we're<00:00:32.790> now

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the side arm supports and we're now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
the side arm supports and we're now
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> finish<00:00:33.480> putting<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.050> together<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
going to finish putting it together so a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.810 
going to finish putting it together so a
pretty<00:00:36.030> easy<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:37.579> poke<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.730> out

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
pretty easy thing to do poke it out

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.819 
pretty easy thing to do poke it out
through<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> side<00:00:39.739> join<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> together<00:00:44.570> and

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
through the side join it together and

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.350 
through the side join it together and
there<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.460> you've<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> side

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
there we go now that you've got the side

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.350 
there we go now that you've got the side
supports<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.379> both<00:00:49.950> sides<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:51.059> choices

supports in on both sides your choices

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.110 
supports in on both sides your choices
are<00:00:51.719> either<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.680> highly<00:00:53.160> reflective<00:00:53.399> surface

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
are either a highly reflective surface

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.450 
are either a highly reflective surface
or<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.469> diffusing<00:00:55.469> surface<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> once<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
or a diffusing surface and once you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.709 
or a diffusing surface and once you
decide<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.149> you're<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> use

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
accordingly and then put in the middle

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
accordingly and then put in the middle
support<00:01:09.320> there<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.640> already

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
support there you have it it's already

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
support there you have it it's already
together<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.760> very<00:01:15.479> rigidly<00:01:16.640> supported

quite well and I really dislike putting
it<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.240> third-party<00:02:33.240> flash<00:02:34.170> stands<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it on third-party flash stands this is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.970 
it on third-party flash stands this is
one<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.810> few<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.110> I've<00:02:37.230> ever<00:02:37.260> used<00:02:37.710> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
one of the few that I've ever used that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.570 
one of the few that I've ever used that
when<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> block<00:02:38.670> down<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.800> sb-800<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.310> not

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
when I block down my sb-800 it's not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.030 
when I block down my sb-800 it's not
going<00:02:41.850> anywhere<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> put<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.920> on

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
going anywhere so you can put it on

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.980 
going anywhere so you can put it on
there<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.550> secure<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> fact<00:02:45.210> that<00:02:45.570> it

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
there and be secure in the fact that it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.250 
there and be secure in the fact that it
is<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.800> going<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.160> come<00:02:47.370> off<00:02:48.110> one<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.140> the
