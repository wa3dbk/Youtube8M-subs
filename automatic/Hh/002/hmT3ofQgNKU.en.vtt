00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.950 
consensus that I hear from girls that
wear<00:02:47.760> thongs<00:02:48.000> say<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.660> very

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
wear thongs say that it's very

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.360 
wear thongs say that it's very
uncomfortable<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.710> I'd<00:02:49.770> assume<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.310> would

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
uncomfortable and I'd assume that would

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.750 
uncomfortable and I'd assume that would
be<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> same<00:02:50.820> thing<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.590> men<00:02:52.590> parts<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
be the same thing with men parts so you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.160 
be the same thing with men parts so you
guys<00:02:53.910> should<00:02:53.940> try<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.360> boxer<00:02:54.720> briefs<00:02:55.020> but

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
guys should try like boxer briefs but

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.020 
guys should try like boxer briefs but
whenever<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.470> think<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.830> boxer<00:02:56.280> briefs<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.760> think

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
whenever I think of boxer briefs I think

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.400 
whenever I think of boxer briefs I think
that<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.450> should<00:02:57.630> be<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> guy<00:02:58.020> that's<00:02:58.050> like

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that it should be a guy that's like

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.140 
that it should be a guy that's like
packing<00:02:58.830> heat<00:02:59.040> since<00:02:59.430> its<00:02:59.610> kind<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.880> tighter

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
packing heat since its kind of tighter

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.760 
packing heat since its kind of tighter
to<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.540> body<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.170> kind<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> see<00:03:01.590> your

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
to your body you can kind of see your

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.640 
to your body you can kind of see your
junk<00:03:02.040> better<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.420> guess

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
junk better and it like I guess

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.990 
junk better and it like I guess
complements<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.740> junk<00:03:05.130> size<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.820> thing

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
complements your junk size but the thing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.910 
complements your junk size but the thing
is<00:03:06.030> if<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.450> don't<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.870> big<00:03:07.200> dick<00:03:07.440> then<00:03:07.740> it's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
is if you don't have big dick then it's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.890 
is if you don't have big dick then it's
quite<00:03:08.160> embarrassing<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:09.720> is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
quite embarrassing actually and this is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
quite embarrassing actually and this is
probably<00:03:10.080> where<00:03:10.530> my<00:03:10.820> insecurities<00:03:11.820> come<00:03:12.030> in

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
probably where my insecurities come in
