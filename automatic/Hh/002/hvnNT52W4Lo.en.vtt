driven now the transmission so what's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
driven now the transmission so what's
this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.399> automatic<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> like

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this is an automatic you know me I like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
this is an automatic you know me I like
three<00:01:45.659> pedals<00:01:46.189> it's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.310> totally<00:01:47.640> new

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
three pedals it's a totally new

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
three pedals it's a totally new
automatic<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.750> an<00:01:48.899> 8-speed<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.829> what's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
automatic it's an 8-speed but what's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
automatic it's an 8-speed but what's
unique<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.240> torque<00:01:51.630> converter

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
unique about it it's a torque converter

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.870 
unique about it it's a torque converter
now<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> cars<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.340> segment<00:01:53.549> are

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
now a lot of cars in this segment are

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
now a lot of cars in this segment are
doing<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> dual<00:01:54.840> clutch<00:01:55.140> thing<00:01:55.439> including

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
doing the dual clutch thing including

doing the dual clutch thing including
Mercedes<00:01:56.189> Dave<00:01:57.000> decided<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> stick<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
Mercedes Dave decided to stick with a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.690 
Mercedes Dave decided to stick with a
torque<00:01:58.409> converter<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.979> he<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.250> able<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> get

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
torque converter but he was able to get

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270 
torque converter but he was able to get
this<00:01:59.850> thing<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> shift<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.899> fast<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> dual

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this thing to shift as fast as a dual

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.740 
this thing to shift as fast as a dual
clutch<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.149> did<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.450> once

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
clutch I don't know how he did it once

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
clutch I don't know how he did it once
again<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.530> gonna<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.860> him<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.460> over<00:02:05.579> this

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
when Dave showed us the CTSV sport he

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.890 
when Dave showed us the CTSV sport he
had<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.220> same<00:02:46.489> kind<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.849> setup<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:47.329> well<00:02:47.810> he

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
had the same kind of setup here well he

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.539 
had the same kind of setup here well he
decided<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.409> bring<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.650> down<00:02:48.829> from<00:02:49.099> Michigan

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
number one see the structural shear

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.110 
number one see the structural shear
panel<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.040> call<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> here

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
panel they call it here

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.199 
panel they call it here
this<00:02:56.480> thing<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.840> unique<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.889> ats-v<00:02:58.669> and<00:02:59.000> it

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
this thing is unique to the ats-v and it

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.229 
this thing is unique to the ats-v and it
adds<00:02:59.680> 25%<00:03:00.680> stiffness<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.430> thing<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.939> if

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
adds 25% stiffness to this thing and if

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.720 
adds 25% stiffness to this thing and if
you<00:03:02.389> saw<00:03:02.599> our<00:03:02.750> 80s<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.470> 80s<00:03:03.889> film<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.639> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
you saw our 80s the 80s film is the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.909 
you saw our 80s the 80s film is the
regular<00:03:05.060> one<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.900> was<00:03:06.109> already<00:03:06.439> a<00:03:06.620> very

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
regular one this was already a very

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.740 
regular one this was already a very
stiff<00:03:07.220> car<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:07.639> this<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.939> unique<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.599> way

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
stiff car so this is unique and the way

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.379 
stiff car so this is unique and the way
did<00:03:09.109> it<00:03:09.260> I'm<00:03:10.250> sure<00:03:10.669> he<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:10.939> I<00:03:10.970> kind<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.180> talked

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
did it I'm sure he and I kind of talked

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.300 
did it I'm sure he and I kind of talked
about<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:11.689> way<00:03:11.870> back<00:03:12.079> at<00:03:12.200> LA<00:03:12.349> Auto<00:03:12.560> Show<00:03:12.680> this

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
about this way back at LA Auto Show this

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.679

thing as carbon fiber comes standard on
every<00:04:52.190> ats-v

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
every ats-v

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.630
