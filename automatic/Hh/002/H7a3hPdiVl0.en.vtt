00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hello 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.660
 so last night released the trailer of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.949
 even old during or and I am 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.949
 hospitalized and I recorded my reaction 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 so I 'm going to show you my 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 straight 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 André affirms I recorded with the webcam then 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.179
 're taking too long to say that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 star was very good 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.770
 It's only necessary to watch this white more 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.770
 once for me to speak the considerations 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 if you now 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:01:02.879
 so after I finished laughing on Apr 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.879
 the legal opinion can not even 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.260
 nor was the union of the two throughout the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.350
 less real at university on the river 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.159
 is not it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.159
 rap china 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.200
 in hong kong as soon as you know it was in 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:32.170
 Europe the day is sunny and reach take the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.170
 choral singhal 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.880
 the Brazilian foment mine 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.880
 family and not a break the shot 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.480
 profile-to stay 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 Night does not arrive, everyone says 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.399
 Well, but you did not come here training 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.399
 quickie makes considerations 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.690
 this part of the box was nothing like me 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.269
 I imagined that another business well 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:30.580
 rustic even the business well nor explain 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:33.069
 one thing but the less technological ones 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.010
 something like that , and also the house will 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.599
 climbing very fast with Thomas is 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.450
 that the box book under the box goes 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.610
 up he speaks in second but in this 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.849
 box rising but I do not think everything is 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.849
 on here 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.390
 the farm inside the labyrinth is more or 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.220
 less as I imagined the walls more 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.340
 They are very different 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.099
 so stone even knows those stones 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 so in the mobile city ​​of the interior of 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.470
 mines 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.530
 so this way it's something else 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.870
 smoother with a little of wolf I 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.739
 I think I do not know but okay too 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.739
 because 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.609
 as i expected 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.609
 xuxa was already a good job 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.010
 This is what explains nilde. 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.450
 I have a problem with the fetus that does 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.820
 united because so I found a cuddly 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.340
 It's okay, he's a cute little focus. 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.900
 pleasant but in a thousand days he was to 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.780
 being one of the older boys and also 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:46.990
 he was to be one of the strongest and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.020
 more frightening and it is not 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.570
 fact that makes half a row lean 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.000
 I do not know how much automobile I'm guilty of 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.920
 he is of the law and is also here 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.200
 British godah where you had 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.620
 British accent 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.050
 the executioners are telling everybody 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.430
 I wanted to know how the hell was a 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 The seller can not see what 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.890
 I understand that they will do it if they want 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:25.750
 leave a suspense to film was this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:29.070
 that they show a little bit like this one 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.120
 knife size of a single cow standing up 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.120
 threw titles right 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.610
 I really liked the choice of 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.500
 time because I think she 's beautiful, 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.810
 perfect and amadeus schin 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.380
 I finally got this idea that I have 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.980
 but she can talk in one of the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.890
 corners is standard can not make a 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.580
 bullshit 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:11.430
 she is more reserved and until she is 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.430
 completely open and my usual 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.720
 so let's say the actress then she has 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.300
 that vary according to a character 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.300
 so I do not know, I do not know either 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.669
 the maze wells is very good 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.219
 kind very very little understands is that he 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.069
 is that I stayed super ultra mega master 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.509
 excited about this movie but that already 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.330
 was in progress 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.280
 one of the things do not judge me for it 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.990
 but one of the things I think is that 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.759
 this movie may be even better than 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.590
 I know this book is very rare. 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.620
 I happen to know this almost never 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.530
 It happens like this but I honestly think so. 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.349
 that this movie may be best for 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.139
 that I personally have watched you 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.870
 to the video with the review of the lion book 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.759
 It 's just you know I did not like the 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.599
 beginning of the book I did not find it 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.490
 I was arresting I did not like the native one 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.500
 I see in the middle 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:21.759
 only there from Sunday to take 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.529
 not even when 95 and I liked it a lot 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.949
 There's only one thing I think jeans 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:31.240
 this technique is still it is of great 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:33.250
 action and I tasted it even beyond 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.889
 proof that it is the book two days in the 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.169
 same area I stayed much longer 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.599
 interested in the psychological dramas of 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.969
 characters than in action even because 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.180
 I think the way the day 7 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:49.120
 describes the action happening the fight I know 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.150
 there runs at half mast yield 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.240
 enough 16 my conception is what I 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.000
 I think I do not know about you, maybe you 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.339
 like but in my design then not 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.449
 I like me and my show which drew 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:05.529
 Attention was also drawn to this 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:08.259
 dystopia and I think it has a chance because 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:12.900
 if the action is good 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:16.060
 in the movie because I did not like the free zone 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:20.099
 so I think it has everything to be 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.099
 very very very good too 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.690
 it's a shame no but I liked the actor 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.669
 that they climbed because they 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.320
 Just as I was in the kitchen when 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.960
 happens a 12 year old will be 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.960
 chubby so it was well
