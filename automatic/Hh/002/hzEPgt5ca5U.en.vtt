investigators are still working on it
and<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:52.890> think<00:03:53.100> they<00:03:53.220> are<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.340> about<00:03:53.760> ready<00:03:53.819> to

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
and I think they are just about ready to

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.960 
and I think they are just about ready to
release<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.900> airport<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:56.519> think<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:56.940> just

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
release the airport and I think we just

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.580 
release the airport and I think we just
have<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.420> give<00:03:57.569> them<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.750> little<00:03:57.900> bit<00:03:58.140> more<00:03:58.319> time

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
have to give them a little bit more time

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.800 
have to give them a little bit more time
and<00:03:58.880> within<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.060> very<00:04:00.090> short<00:04:00.269> while<00:04:00.600> they

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and within a very short while they

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.240 
and within a very short while they
already<00:04:00.989> stay<00:04:01.290> report<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:01.890> they<00:04:02.100> have

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
already stay report because they have

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.770 
already stay report because they have
basically<00:04:02.549> finished<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.239> building<00:04:03.600> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
basically finished with the building and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.569 
basically finished with the building and
I<00:04:04.319> think<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:04.799> writing<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.459> report

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
I think they're just writing the report

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.949 
I think they're just writing the report
we<00:04:06.480> had<00:04:06.690> already<00:04:07.049> put<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.769> very<00:04:08.160> modern<00:04:08.579> fire<00:04:08.959> my

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
we had already put a very modern fire my

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.070 
we had already put a very modern fire my
ass<00:04:10.010> fire<00:04:11.010> system

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
ass fire system

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.040 
ass fire system
30<00:04:12.260> disaster<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.070> class<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.720> although<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
30 disaster in class and although the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.699 
30 disaster in class and although the
fire<00:04:16.269> extinguishers<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.510> Sonia<00:04:18.080> so<00:04:18.590> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
fire extinguishers and Sonia so the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.550 
fire extinguishers and Sonia so the
building<00:04:18.920> is<00:04:19.489> very<00:04:19.940> very<00:04:20.170> twisted<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.320> fire

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
building is very very twisted to fire

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.620 
building is very very twisted to fire
but<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.400> need<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.700> just<00:04:22.850> appreciate<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
but you need to just appreciate the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.630 
but you need to just appreciate the
amount<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.990> work<00:04:24.230> that<00:04:24.260> has<00:04:24.470> gone<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:25.460> come

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
amount of work that has gone to come

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.440 
amount of work that has gone to come
back<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:29.440> exactly
