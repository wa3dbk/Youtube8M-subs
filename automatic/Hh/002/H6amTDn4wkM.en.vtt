00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 I think bulldozer to 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 from the porsche technics series times I dutifully 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.520
 Thief chipiere technician tractor me to you 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:19.000
 Liked I decided to continue collecting 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.000
 a series of techniques so the first set 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.620
 second set yes this set we did not expect 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.039
 will turtles will not I do not like 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.039
 collect not turtles after all series 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.369
 good and in general this is my childhood 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.369
 ninja turtles 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.549
 so I decided to buy a lair of turtles 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.479
 and then this set on the site you're smart 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.509
 just cheap 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.509
 well, why not well, and the last set 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.909
 This is a series of lego movie 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.219
 big box honestly I thought 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.340
 she will i think she will be smaller 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.000
 so hard 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.170
 relatively inexpensive above naborchiki 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.379
 here good bad cop emmet not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.420
 perhaps all in general for the most part and 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:30.140
 borrow this one like that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.959
 small distinct well considered here 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:41.150
 on wreaths here as always the catalog goes 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.640
 grids go to the directory think its even 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.700
 on this site and grabbed your share 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.549
 so that I cleaned up in the locker and now 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.139

 mess more specifically just in this room 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.239
 disassemble lego want to postpone 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.200
 big details big little k 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.040

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.410
 individual parts 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:45.049
 scanty and now I 'll show you how 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.959
 I've already cleaned up at least here by 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.410
 shelves all laid out a little bit here I 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.810
 left a place there will be turtles 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.620
 here I will have a technician that is 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.750
 everything is correctly laid out by the way here here 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.210
 there are still spongebob figures 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.010

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.920
 individual will not know on the live channel 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.070

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.380
 both abu 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.960
 shorter wait for a review on one or the other 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.470
 the channel itself has not yet decided 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.470
 and here is how I cleaned up 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.340
 I will show instructions here 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.980
 This card here has kept a bag of 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.440
 minifigures for memory here business cards 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:44.480

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:49.890
 there brik in that box are here 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.910
 scanty details here they are not straight firms in 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.330
 that box 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.970

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.240

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:12.930
 I have boxes from under the technician 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.500
 of the past 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.620
 she now serves as a box for everyone 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.750
 such a bag fell for all sorts of bags 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.740
 there are absolutely different packages like you 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.150
 can see them a lot well you know 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.670
 tea bags do not come in handy for you 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.280
 for which these parts or kits and flock 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.340
 I will sell but perhaps it's all on 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.880
 today the only thing we could 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.490
 notice my camera then it is saturated 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.390
 the colors here I see the color on the screen is very 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.720
 saturated 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.570
 I don’t know that lately 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.600
 do and so and so tried not to like 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.170
 my color is in my room is 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.780
 yellow colors here is a light yellow lamp 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.430
 whose lamp shines yellow on the table 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:07.660
 I want to see what white color to 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.430
 the lighting was better here so I will be going to 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.020
 buy white lamps 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.270
 because I like but really here 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.610
 we are so intense color i 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.250
 tried so every change anyway 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.610
 It turns out a rich plan for everyone 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.240
 thank you for watching the end and to 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.880
