know why but they're metal so up here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.440 
know why but they're metal so up here
that's<00:01:45.649> just<00:01:45.830> an<00:01:46.069> example<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.849> a<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
that's just an example I have a the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.480 
that's just an example I have a the
Logitech<00:01:48.289> X<00:01:48.560> 5<00:01:48.770> 40s<00:01:49.420> for<00:01:50.500> my<00:01:51.500> 5.1<00:01:52.340> surround

Logitech X 5 40s for my 5.1 surround
sound<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:53.090> although<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.990> think<00:01:54.440> those<00:01:54.560> are<00:01:54.679> two

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
sound and although I think those are two

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.440 
sound and although I think those are two
inch<00:01:55.160> satellites<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:57.530> are<00:01:57.649> five<00:01:58.270> cases<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
inch satellites there are five cases of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.010 
inch satellites there are five cases of
two<00:01:59.750> inch<00:01:59.899> satellites<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:01.390> yeah<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.479> guess<00:02:02.810> I'll

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
two inch satellites so yeah I guess I'll

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.729

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.880 
bass and treble levels of one came out
more<00:02:56.010> than<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:58.470> we<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:58.860> I

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
more than the other and here we have I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:15.010 
more than the other and here we have I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.620 

so<00:03:16.020> yeah<00:03:16.280> as<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.460> heard<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> has<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.270> there's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
so yeah as you heard it has it there's

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.450 
so yeah as you heard it has it there's
not<00:03:18.780> much<00:03:18.990> distortion<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.710> have<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.070> really

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
not much distortion I have it's really

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.560 
not much distortion I have it's really
hard<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.700> tell<00:03:20.820> them<00:03:20.940> once<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.210> put<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
hard to tell them once you put it you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.250 
hard to tell them once you put it you
know<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.930> loud<00:03:22.110> with<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.100> bass<00:03:23.340> high<00:03:23.580> up

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
know really loud with the bass high up

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.620 
know really loud with the bass high up
other<00:03:25.260> than<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.650> they're<00:03:26.370> pretty<00:03:27.120> solid<00:03:27.570> on

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
other than that they're pretty solid on

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.040 
other than that they're pretty solid on
music<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.250> bass<00:03:29.460> sounds<00:03:29.820> great<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
music I think the bass sounds great the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.630 
music I think the bass sounds great the
trouble<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.650> stuff<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.950> know<00:03:32.070> if<00:03:32.190> you're<00:03:32.580> not

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

getting enough of one you can you know

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
getting enough of one you can you know
just<00:03:35.010> put<00:03:35.460> it<00:03:35.550> up<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.880> also<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.480> comes<00:03:36.600> with

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
just put it up and also it comes with

a reset button and this will reset all

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.620 
a reset button and this will reset all
you<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.220> values<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.090> trouble<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
bass but unfortunately also resets the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.780

mute<00:03:51.000> button<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.420> guess<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> want<00:03:51.990> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080 
mute button I guess if you want to
cancel<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:52.709> of<00:03:52.860> course<00:03:52.890> bass<00:03:53.790> down

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
cancel that and then of course bass down

examples

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.990 

sounded<00:04:44.740> really<00:04:44.860> nice

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.490 

let's<00:04:50.000> try<00:04:50.270> some<00:04:51.880> grenade<00:04:52.880> maybe<00:04:58.210> see<00:04:59.210> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
let's try some grenade maybe see the

let's try some grenade maybe see the
explosions<00:05:01.780> use<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> good<00:05:03.050> amount<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.350> base<00:05:03.530> and

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
explosions use a good amount of base and

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.680 
explosions use a good amount of base and
it<00:05:03.980> sounds<00:05:04.340> very<00:05:04.490> nice<00:05:04.730> doesn't<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.540> to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
it sounds very nice doesn't have to

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.930 
it sounds very nice doesn't have to
overpower<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.200> I'm<00:05:06.320> not<00:05:06.740> enough<00:05:06.980> area<00:05:07.669> with

hopefully<00:05:11.000> moves<00:05:11.240> for<00:05:11.419> next<00:05:11.960> let's<00:05:12.590> try

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
hopefully moves for next let's try

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.220 
hopefully moves for next let's try
suppressor<00:05:16.450> sounds<00:05:17.450> pretty<00:05:17.630> cool<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.050> then<00:05:18.139> I

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
suppressor sounds pretty cool and then I

00:05:18.230 --> 00:06:01.439 
suppressor sounds pretty cool and then I
got<00:05:18.410> shocked<00:05:18.650> into<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.010> face<00:05:19.240> all<00:05:20.240> right
