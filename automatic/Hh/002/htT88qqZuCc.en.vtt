ammo rack is and then i'll be moving to
the<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.120> side<00:02:34.190> i'll<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.370> trying<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.640> damage

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the back side i'll be trying to damage

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.180 
the back side i'll be trying to damage
the<00:02:36.330> turret<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.410> want<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> damage<00:02:37.770> the

engine you just aim a little lower next
is<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.120> right<00:02:42.480> side<00:02:42.780> I'll<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.230> hitting<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.650> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
is the right side I'll be hitting that a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.310 
is the right side I'll be hitting that a
maroc<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.310> more<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.110> also

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
maroc one more time so it's also

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.710 
maroc one more time so it's also
important<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> note<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.760> armor<00:02:48.239> slope

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
important to note that the armor slope

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
important to note that the armor slope
of<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.050> 10<00:02:49.290> 10<00:02:49.500> 3<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.100> similar<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> is-3<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of a 10 10 3 is similar to the is-3 and

of a 10 10 3 is similar to the is-3 and
that<00:02:52.560> you're<00:02:53.070> firing<00:02:53.310> position<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:54.030> negate

that you're firing position can negate

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.850 
that you're firing position can negate
