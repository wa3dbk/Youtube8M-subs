 whoever depending on the market meanwhile change their strategy 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.500
 No moment after the tried and tested 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.749
 so 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.749
 we have for it they had called further 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.660
 the contentious issues such as there are certainly in the box the 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.730
 Hamburger I understand I already 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.820
 Heine is something completely new to her. "No, that's not correct 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.370
 a real shame 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.590
 How many people had the customer experienced a hope to be led 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.489
 five people he knew they are so much too much they say it is 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.979
 Of course we can adapt that accordingly and have a little something 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.829
 he can already manage 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.189
 I mean they know people tested the quartet to Zurich they see it 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.919
 is so samples 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.919
 the jurisdiction 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.510
 Today I do not know that in the strategy 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.389
 the marketing organization 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.269
 adjust accordingly 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.479
 colourbox 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.299
 Gold around 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.870
 Every week we expect three newspaper ads newspaper among fans 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.540
 First place on Wednesday so a new era at the moment times Weisband with words 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.969
 with FAS Siebert as 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.319
 Trading week inconsistently back again 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.319
 they bring us the idea, it actually does not do it at all 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.899
 LaCie d2 you contact 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.959
 Norbert Beek the Brown 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 the ECE Bulls 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.589
 sensitive to picture de 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.149
 in front of the church 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.039
 Penny do you really want the job Hey Hey, I'm not here with me 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.329
 dangerously aggravated 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.669
 Lotta Schelin 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.119
 Pierre also take her team step the appropriate spot with it 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.889
 During the day, they will be reworked for what they are in 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.959
 are essentially responsible 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.429
 During the Thursday they have to be thankful for the internet 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.059
 we want the ones out of that 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.469
 on friday we are looking for the branches to advertise 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.379
 and if this has been done to a radio or television there is 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.119
 the nonsense is meaningless 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.209
 February 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.769
 but you know, basically, you're never done with that, that's not possible, that's right 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:13.339
 clear 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:18.750
 there keeps charging there I think that is probably temporary when they have them 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.659
 so far always something has said nothing else has done than before two 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.620
 years 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.720
 but if you want to work in this home in the marketing department 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.960
 then they have to want it 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.380
 and for that to be perfectly clear we need to convince ourselves that we are 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.559
 you want to 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.559
 So what about it? 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.490
 ten buildings happened 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.240
 the cat and Nuremberg 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.639
 I'm completely crazy 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.639
 on 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.200
 I like that 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.180
 to 11 it would be ridiculous I think that he saw the very early on 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.939
 Judge got Inter's verdict 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:58.889
