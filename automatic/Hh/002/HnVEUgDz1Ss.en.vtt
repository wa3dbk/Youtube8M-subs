sticks in here so we'll have some a base

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:51.840 
sticks in here so we'll have some a base
for<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:49.830> start<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> generator<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.820> a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
for that start the generator we got a

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.640 
for that start the generator we got a
generator<00:02:52.300> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.570> truck<00:02:52.900> will<00:02:53.170> start<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
generator in the truck will start that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:04.890 
generator in the truck will start that
up<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:55.720> with
