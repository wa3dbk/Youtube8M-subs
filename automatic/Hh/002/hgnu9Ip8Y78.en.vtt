00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
use made a very simple mock-up you can

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.780 
use made a very simple mock-up you can
make<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.650> complicated<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.580> but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.420 
this is the bare minimum what you need
to<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> limit<00:01:16.799> snow<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> um<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> need

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
to have a limit snow so um what you need

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
to have a limit snow so um what you need
is<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:21.619> kind<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.820> solid<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.540> any<00:01:25.049> material

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
is some kind of solid or any material

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
is some kind of solid or any material
that<00:01:25.710> doesn't<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> shovel<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> break<00:01:26.970> for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that doesn't use a shovel to break for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
that doesn't use a shovel to break for
the<00:01:27.270> bottom<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:29.220> i'll<00:01:29.310> show

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the bottom because actually i'll show

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.859 
the bottom because actually i'll show
you<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.759> works<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.479> i'll<00:01:30.570> explain

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you how it works and then i'll explain

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.280 
you how it works and then i'll explain
it<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.890> basically<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:33.390> happens<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:33.960> snow

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it so basically what happens when snow

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
it so basically what happens when snow
golems<00:01:34.710> run<00:01:34.920> around<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.850> leave<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> path

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
golems run around is they leave a path

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
golems run around is they leave a path
of<00:01:36.780> snow<00:01:37.049> wherever<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.549> they

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of snow wherever they go so if they

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.749 
of snow wherever they go so if they
can't<00:01:39.000> move<00:01:39.299> you're<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> have

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
can't move you're just going to have

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
can't move you're just going to have
those<00:01:41.759> keep<00:01:42.180> generating<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.960> as<00:01:43.110> fast<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
those keep generating it as fast as you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.770 
those keep generating it as fast as you
can<00:01:43.890> swing<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.250> shovel<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> that's<00:01:45.540> going

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
can swing your shovel and that's going

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.889 
can swing your shovel and that's going
to<00:01:45.840> give<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.229> snowballs<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> that's<00:01:48.630> how<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to give you snowballs so that's how you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
to give you snowballs so that's how you
get<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.110> unlimited<00:01:49.409> snow<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.850> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
get your unlimited snow now to make a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080 
get your unlimited snow now to make a
snow<00:01:54.600> golem<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> whole<00:01:57.060> thing

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
snow golem you or make this whole thing

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
snow golem you or make this whole thing
i<00:01:57.450> guess<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> make<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.290> small<00:01:58.979> room

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
i guess you need to make a small room

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.450 
i guess you need to make a small room
with<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.329> front<00:02:00.689> open<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.950> need<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> solid

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
with the front open you need a solid

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
with the front open you need a solid
blocker<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.939> does<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.299> use<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> shovel<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
blocker that does not use a shovel so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
blocker that does not use a shovel so
you<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.469> accidentally<00:02:05.009> dig<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.750> i

you do not accidentally dig it out i
used<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.619> use<00:02:07.680> cobblestones<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.550> cheap

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
used to use cobblestones it's cheap

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.590 
used to use cobblestones it's cheap
don't<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
don't do that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.990 
don't do that
didn't<00:02:13.560> even<00:02:13.710> get<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> mean

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
didn't even get that back so I mean

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.140 
didn't even get that back so I mean
anyways<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.800> want<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> seal<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
anyways and you want to seal up the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.060 
anyways and you want to seal up the
front<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.900> want<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> leave<00:02:19.380> his<00:02:19.650> feet

front so you just want to leave his feet

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.310 
front so you just want to leave his feet
or<00:02:20.310> he<00:02:20.730> doesn't<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.030> feet<00:02:21.240> but<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.540> area<00:02:22.050> on

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
solid bottom so then after that you go

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.310 
solid bottom so then after that you go
up<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.460> top<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.840> go<00:02:31.020> into<00:02:31.290> your

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
up to the top of it and you go into your

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.590 
up to the top of it and you go into your
little<00:02:31.620> four<00:02:32.070> by<00:02:32.220> four<00:02:32.490> crafting<00:02:33.000> square<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
little four by four crafting square and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.990 
little four by four crafting square and
you<00:02:33.750> make<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.710> snowballs<00:02:35.370> which<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.820> why<00:02:35.940> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you make to snowballs which is why you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
you make to snowballs which is why you
need<00:02:36.240> eight<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.380> make<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> snow<00:02:38.010> blocks

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
need eight or you make to snow blocks

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.060 
need eight or you make to snow blocks
which<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.880> why<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.060> need<00:02:39.210> eight<00:02:39.420> snowballs<00:02:40.170> so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
which is why you need eight snowballs so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.840 
which is why you need eight snowballs so
you<00:02:41.460> need<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.910> snow<00:02:42.510> blocks<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:44.400> stack<00:02:44.730> them

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
you need to snow blocks you stack them

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
you need to snow blocks you stack them
on<00:02:44.970> top<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.210> each<00:02:45.390> other<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.870> place<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
on top of each other and you place the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
on top of each other and you place the
pumpkin<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.400> head<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.300> how<00:02:48.480> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
pumpkin on the head and that's how you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.010 
pumpkin on the head and that's how you
create<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.900> snow<00:02:49.140> golem<00:02:49.320> um<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.970> seal<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
create a snow golem um just seal up the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.660 
create a snow golem um just seal up the
top<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.500> he<00:02:52.530> doesn't<00:02:52.770> jump<00:02:53.100> because<00:02:53.550> you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
top so he doesn't jump because you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.010 
top so he doesn't jump because you
wanted<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.120> touching<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> ground<00:02:54.660> at<00:02:54.900> all

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
wanted to be touching the ground at all

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.110 
wanted to be touching the ground at all
times<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
times and that's it you just the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.370 
times and that's it you just the
shallows<00:02:57.840> feet<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:59.220> recommend<00:03:00.050> leaving<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
shallows feet I recommend leaving the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.440 
shallows feet I recommend leaving the
whole<00:03:01.650> area<00:03:01.980> around<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.640> open<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.270> case

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
whole area around it open just in case

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.700 
whole area around it open just in case
some<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> snowballs<00:03:04.110> jump<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.680> back

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
some the snowballs jump out the back

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.710 
some the snowballs jump out the back
because<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.340> with<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.090> design<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.690> can

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
because you can with this design you can

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.860 
because you can with this design you can
just<00:03:07.170> walk<00:03:07.380> around<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.830> grab<00:03:08.160> them<00:03:08.310> all<00:03:08.870> this

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
just walk around and grab them all this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.380 
just walk around and grab them all this
is<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.170> bare<00:03:10.470> minimum<00:03:10.800> design<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.610> could<00:03:12.150> think

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
is the bare minimum design I could think

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570 
is the bare minimum design I could think
of<00:03:12.630> um<00:03:12.960> I'm<00:03:13.710> sure<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.280> make<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.490> more

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
of um I'm sure you can make it more

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.140 
of um I'm sure you can make it more
complicated<00:03:14.790> or<00:03:15.800> somehow<00:03:16.800> automated<00:03:17.580> i'm<00:03:17.790> not

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
complicated or somehow automated i'm not

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.690 
complicated or somehow automated i'm not
sure<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.740> this<00:03:19.740> is<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.310> need<00:03:20.340> really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
sure but this is all you need really

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.380 
sure but this is all you need really
just<00:03:21.150> sit<00:03:21.390> here<00:03:22.310> look<00:03:23.310> at<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.580> edge<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
just sit here look at the edge of the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.930 
just sit here look at the edge of the
snow<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.140> go<00:03:25.530> go<00:03:25.980> at<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.160> get<00:03:26.550> as<00:03:26.730> much

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
snow and just go go at it get as much

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.580 
snow and just go go at it get as much
snow<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.450> need<00:03:27.920> i<00:03:28.920> know<00:03:29.580> i<00:03:29.790> use<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:30.590> just

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
snow as you need i know i use this just

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.170 
snow as you need i know i use this just
now<00:03:31.770> when<00:03:32.010> i<00:03:32.040> was<00:03:32.250> updating<00:03:32.430> something<00:03:33.060> you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
now when i was updating something you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.470 
now when i was updating something you
might<00:03:33.300> see<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.660> later<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.850> yeah<00:03:35.850> having

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
might see that later but yeah having

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.940 
might see that later but yeah having
snow<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.080> pretty<00:03:37.530> useful<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:40.050> get<00:03:40.290> snowballs

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
snow is pretty useful to get snowballs

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.550 
snow is pretty useful to get snowballs
you<00:03:41.190> need<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.700> use<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.880> shovel<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:43.170> can't<00:03:43.470> just

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
you need to use a shovel you can't just

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.810 
you need to use a shovel you can't just
hit<00:03:43.830> them<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:46.230> find<00:03:46.980> snow<00:03:47.280> i<00:03:47.310> guess<00:03:47.670> you're

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
hit them and to find snow i guess you're

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.550 
hit them and to find snow i guess you're
just<00:03:47.850> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.240> explore<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.660> bit<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.410> only

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
just going to explore a bit you only

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.620 
just going to explore a bit you only
have<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.770> find<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.160> small<00:03:50.580> patch<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.180> get<00:03:51.390> one

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
have to find a small patch you get one
