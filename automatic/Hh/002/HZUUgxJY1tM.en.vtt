shutter speed so i'll be going over with
you<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.780> shutter<00:01:37.020> speeds<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.560> i<00:01:37.829> used<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you the shutter speeds that i used in

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.550 
you the shutter speeds that i used in
each<00:01:38.909> image<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.540> you'll<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.079> video

a<00:01:57.420> second<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.079> f<00:01:58.350> 2.8<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.700> taken<00:02:00.119> with

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
a second at f 2.8 and it was taken with

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.709 
a second at f 2.8 and it was taken with
a<00:02:00.329> 24<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> 72<00:02:01.500> point<00:02:01.920> 8<00:02:02.040> lens<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.719> 24

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
a 24 to 72 point 8 lens at 24

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
a 24 to 72 point 8 lens at 24
millimeters<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.399> were<00:02:05.490> able<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.880> capture

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
millimeters so we were able to capture

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.949 
millimeters so we were able to capture
the<00:02:06.450> water<00:02:06.689> droplets<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.500> beautiful<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
the water droplets just beautiful in

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.710 
the water droplets just beautiful in
this<00:02:09.959> image<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.760> we<00:02:11.760> slowed<00:02:12.120> down<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.510> shutter

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this image we we slowed down the shutter

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
this image we we slowed down the shutter
speed<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> 15

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
speed to 15

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.270 
speed to 15
tenth<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.370> second<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:14.940> f/16<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:17.190> were

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
tenth of a second at f/16 and we were

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.340 
tenth of a second at f/16 and we were
able<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.580> capture<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.150> blur<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.080> water

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
able to capture the blur of the water

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.150 
able to capture the blur of the water
but<00:02:20.070> still<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:21.210> bit<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:22.740> more

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
but still have a little bit of of more

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.720 
but still have a little bit of of more
you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> droplets<00:02:24.960> of<00:02:25.080> water<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can see the droplets of water so you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
you can see the droplets of water so you
do<00:02:27.060> need<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> tripod<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:28.110> these<00:02:28.290> shots<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:29.310> keep

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
do need a tripod for these shots to keep

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.880 
do need a tripod for these shots to keep
everything<00:02:30.030> else<00:02:30.330> sharp<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.560> last

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
everything else sharp and in this last

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.510 
everything else sharp and in this last
image<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:33.030> shot<00:02:33.300> at<00:02:33.570> one<00:02:33.990> fifth<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.070> second

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
image we shot at one fifth of a second

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.870 
image we shot at one fifth of a second
at<00:02:35.690> f-22<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.110> water<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.340> blur

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
at f-22 so the water is just a blur

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.960 
at f-22 so the water is just a blur
motion<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.620> um<00:02:40.890> beautiful<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> way

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
motion it's just um beautiful the way

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.650 
motion it's just um beautiful the way
you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.300> capture<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.140> Falls<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you can capture the Falls like this so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.400 
you can capture the Falls like this so
here's<00:02:46.590> another<00:02:46.890> sample<00:02:47.750> we're<00:02:48.750> shooting<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
here's another sample we're shooting a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.650 
here's another sample we're shooting a
river<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.940> shooting<00:02:51.330> straight

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
river here and I'm shooting straight

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.830 
river here and I'm shooting straight
down<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.200> next<00:02:52.320> stem<00:02:52.770> frame<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.660> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
down in the next stem frame and as you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
down in the next stem frame and as you
can<00:02:55.020> see<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> bubbles<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
can see you can see all the bubbles in

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.860 
can see you can see all the bubbles in
the<00:02:57.060> water<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.320> shot<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:58.980> taken<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.870> 12

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the water so this shot was taken at 12

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.949 
the water so this shot was taken at 12
hundredths<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.860> second<00:03:02.310> again<00:03:03.270> 24

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
hundredths of a second again 24

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.820 
hundredths of a second again 24
millimeter<00:03:04.410> at<00:03:04.790> f5<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.590> capture

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
millimeter at f5 and so you can capture

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.680 
millimeter at f5 and so you can capture
all<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:08.490> details<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> rock<00:03:09.390> and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
all the little details in the rock and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
all the little details in the rock and
the<00:03:09.750> bubbles<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.790> image<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the bubbles and then this image the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.770 
the bubbles and then this image the
shutter<00:03:12.860> was<00:03:13.860> left<00:03:14.130> open<00:03:14.520> one<00:03:14.880> fifth<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
shutter was left open one fifth of a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.460 
shutter was left open one fifth of a
second<00:03:16.200> at<00:03:16.970> f-22<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.390> again<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> bubbles<00:03:19.260> are

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
second at f-22 so again the bubbles are

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.350 
second at f-22 so again the bubbles are
disappearing<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.489> can<00:03:20.640> see<00:03:20.850> more<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
disappearing you can see more of the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.560 
disappearing you can see more of the
flow<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.110> water<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.920> blur<00:03:23.190> motion<00:03:23.570> just

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
flow of the water in a blur motion just

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.509 
flow of the water in a blur motion just
