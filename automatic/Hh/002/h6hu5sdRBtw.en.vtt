00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
because it's more of a visual

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.950 
because it's more of a visual
environment<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> mistake

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

everything<00:02:45.359> appearance-wise<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
everything appearance-wise can do so the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
potential is equal but the approach is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.589 
potential is equal but the approach is
different<00:02:51.950> tough<00:02:52.950> sometimes<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.450> just

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
