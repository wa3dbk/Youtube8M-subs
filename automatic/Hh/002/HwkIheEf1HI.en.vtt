the<00:04:56.400> Confederations<00:04:57.180> Cup<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.360> believe<00:04:57.600> it

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
the Confederations Cup I believe it

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.060 
the Confederations Cup I believe it
wasn't<00:04:57.930> not<00:04:58.020> too<00:04:58.170> sure<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.770> he<00:04:58.860> played

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
wasn't not too sure and he played

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.440 
wasn't not too sure and he played
absolutely<00:04:59.310> brilliantly<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.330> was

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
absolutely brilliantly but that was

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.700 
absolutely brilliantly but that was
winning<00:05:00.660> his<00:05:00.750> playing<00:05:00.960> as<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.170> left<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:01.530> what<00:05:01.650> I

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
winning his playing as a left for what I

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.200 
winning his playing as a left for what I
believe<00:05:01.920> it<00:05:02.040> was<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.340> he's<00:05:02.820> only<00:05:02.970> two

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
believe it was and he's only two

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.610 
believe it was and he's only two
thousand<00:05:03.600> seven<00:05:03.720> hundred<00:05:03.870> coins<00:05:04.170> it<00:05:04.380> he<00:05:04.470> did

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
thousand seven hundred coins it he did

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.720 
thousand seven hundred coins it he did
score<00:05:04.710> one<00:05:04.980> goal<00:05:05.010> when<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.370> egg<00:05:05.460> getting's

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
score one goal when the egg getting's

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.730 
score one goal when the egg getting's
online<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.510> one<00:05:06.750> girl<00:05:06.930> was<00:05:07.140> an<00:05:07.260> absolute
