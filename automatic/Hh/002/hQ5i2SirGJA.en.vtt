00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.760
 if you watched 3 bag then I bought 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.070

 arkham knight here and the first and second 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.500
 and the second I just decided not to 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.600
 I decided to pass a competition 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.090
 so there is usually so 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 notorious and and that I decided this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.689
 just the same 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 for the sake of this, video is recorded because 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.680
 contact yet but again no one would 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.150
 read no one would have come because 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.479
 nobody 's dreaming well 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.520
 if anyone remembers probably nobody remembers 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.579
 so I probably mention nothing about 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 the old will not and just try 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:54.409

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.490
 which I will then pass them 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.290
 win the game itself as if on a computer game 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.910
 you need this batman we have the greatest 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.490
 detective in the world 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.280
 yeah here and to win this game to 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.310
 win this competition during 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.390
 passing batman arkham asylum in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.770
 any series 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.520
 in some episodes the horse will appear 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.680
 seals don't know seals shorter characters in 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.020
 some episodes 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.210
 there in the example, well, in the first may appear 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.340
 in the first may not appear later 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.340
 like some fourth 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.160
 for example, then which one do you have there and there 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.790
 still in the penultimate and in the last 3 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.220
 hours so just before my assumptions in 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.230
 which ones will i poke in which are not here and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.560
 then you will need to collect these 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.170
 all seals from each episode to and then 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.230
 collect from this word and get rude 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 and who is the first to guess his words 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 get bad moroccan city by picking cherries 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:24.310
 Steam up Steam because you can 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.590
 any game to play and then you need 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.290
 clarify says that the game is in the incentive 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.380
 you can play and keep silent what I 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.920
 and you get the game but it is pirated 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.860
 version 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.810
 and it is necessary to clarify here in this cancer to find 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.080
 ti-ai service batman arkham knight city 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.000
 batman arkham city incentive 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.520
 here is the third thing I wanted to say 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.830
 the third 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.610
 the question still doesn’t record h 3 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:03.450
 say after three hours we see it all 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.450
 what did you want to say 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 because I remember neither I at first 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.209
 said three news a thousand you still need 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:24.300
 four hours later so the contest is what 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:31.620
 something else I would not like to write 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:36.150
 contacts whose decided whether for this go 5 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.250
 hours later, god, what else 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.920
 why do I have such memory lapses 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.920
 there was a batman there was a competition and there was 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.750
 Alice what is she doing in the arena? 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:17.770
 I remembered, I remembered above that 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:21.370
 I wanted to say this exactly what I wanted 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.110

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.050

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:45.160
 now you will not work after this 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:47.590
 break psr here before diber can be shorter 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.450
 again go to the VKontakte wall 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.540

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.170
 time has been closed and pepper words can 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:59.080
