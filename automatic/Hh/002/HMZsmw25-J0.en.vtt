00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
movement really tiny control yeah and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.050 
movement really tiny control yeah and
that's<00:02:58.920> where<00:02:59.160> that's<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> C<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.030> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that's where that's for the C and of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.340 
that's where that's for the C and of
course<00:03:00.300> you'd<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:00.990> both<00:03:01.020> sides

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
course you'd have to do it on both sides

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.500 
course you'd have to do it on both sides
because<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.710> have<00:03:01.860> two<00:03:02.160> seats<00:03:02.370> yeah<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.300> like

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
because you have two seats yeah I like

because you have two seats yeah I like
that<00:03:03.630> word<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.110> never<00:03:04.320> know<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
that word see you never know what to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.370
