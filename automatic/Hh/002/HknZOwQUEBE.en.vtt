00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 principle I do not think 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.210
 I come to the arrows 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.660

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.380
 tefal pechera 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:49.050

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.500

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.370

 I have some votes 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.260
 right here right that I'm not 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.260
 living 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.890
