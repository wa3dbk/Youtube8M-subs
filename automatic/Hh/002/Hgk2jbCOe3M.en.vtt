beginner<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> more<00:00:17.580> casual<00:00:18.000> approach<00:00:18.150> where

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
beginner is a more casual approach where

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
beginner is a more casual approach where
accidents<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.289> much<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.619> forgivable<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
accidents are much more forgivable and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
accidents are much more forgivable and
some<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> systems<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:21.630> actually

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
some of the systems are actually

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.200 
some of the systems are actually
disabled<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> great<00:00:23.490> place<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> start

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
disabled so it's a great place to start

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.359
