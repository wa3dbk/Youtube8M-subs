00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
recommendations for different types of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
recommendations for different types of
fillet<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> use<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.460> my

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
fillet that you can use my first one my

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240 
fillet that you can use my first one my
favorite<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> use<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.170> petrale<00:01:01.710> sole<00:01:01.829> now

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
favorite one to use is petrale sole now

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.270 
favorite one to use is petrale sole now
this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> pacific<00:01:03.600> flounder<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.040> has

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this is a pacific flounder and it has

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
this is a pacific flounder and it has
the<00:01:05.700> nicest<00:01:05.909> texture<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.830> mild<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the nicest texture and a very mild and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.719 
the nicest texture and a very mild and
very<00:01:09.119> almost<00:01:09.360> sweet<00:01:09.810> flavor<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> that's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
very almost sweet flavor and so that's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.510 
very almost sweet flavor and so that's
my<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.030> choice<00:01:12.710> my<00:01:13.710> second<00:01:14.100> choice<00:01:14.220> would

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
my first choice my second choice would

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.109 
my first choice my second choice would
be<00:01:14.659> Dover<00:01:15.659> sole<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> probably

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
be Dover sole now that one is probably

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.800 
be Dover sole now that one is probably
half<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> price<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.259> petrale<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> it's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
half the price as petrale and so it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
half the price as petrale and so it's
it's<00:01:22.049> much<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.439> reasonable<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's much more reasonable to make on a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's much more reasonable to make on a
more<00:01:23.970> frequent<00:01:24.119> basis<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.500> third<00:01:25.799> choice

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
more frequent basis the third choice

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
more frequent basis the third choice
that<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> might<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> try<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.240> tilapia

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that you might want to try is tilapia

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
that you might want to try is tilapia
that<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.890> works<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:29.759> fine<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.150> this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that one works the works fine for this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.260 
that one works the works fine for this
as<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> texture<00:01:32.430> isn't<00:01:32.759> quite<00:01:33.060> as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
as well but the texture isn't quite as

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
as well but the texture isn't quite as
good<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.720> certainly<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
good and certainly not as good as the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
good and certainly not as good as the
patroling<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> chance

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
patroling so if you get a chance

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.170 
patroling so if you get a chance
definitely<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.290> petrale<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> here's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
definitely try the petrale so here's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960 
definitely try the petrale so here's
what<00:01:39.420> we'll<00:01:39.570> need<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.110> our<00:01:40.350> recipe<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.850> I've

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
what we'll need for our recipe now I've

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
what we'll need for our recipe now I've
got<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.240> Dover<00:01:42.600> sole<00:01:42.810> you're<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> need

below<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:13.390> my<00:02:13.420> description<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.200> video<00:02:14.560> on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
below in my description of this video on

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.860 
below in my description of this video on
how<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.040> add<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> few<00:02:15.820> spices<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.690> make

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
how to add a few spices to it to make

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
how to add a few spices to it to make
your<00:02:16.990> own<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.130> bought<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.550> already<00:02:18.940> mixed

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
your own but I bought this already mixed

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.260 
your own but I bought this already mixed
and<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.530> probably<00:02:20.920> about<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.790> little

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and so this is probably about a little

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.840 
and so this is probably about a little
over<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> half<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.780> cup<00:02:22.960> of<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.490> then<00:02:24.490> we<00:02:24.520> have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
over a half a cup of that then we have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.090 
over a half a cup of that then we have
some<00:02:25.210> flour<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.990> I've<00:02:26.320> got<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> maybe<00:02:26.710> two<00:02:26.950> or
