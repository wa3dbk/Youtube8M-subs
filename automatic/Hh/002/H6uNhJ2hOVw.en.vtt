00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.460
 sea 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.420
 i 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.990
 Today I'm at the beach and I decided it was 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 good idea how I got out of my bag 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 beach because my two videos has been 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 lovely to see that other 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 people carry and sincerely my bag 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.200
 before it used to be super organized like 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.559
 that I had everything in compartment and 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.350
 I knew what I was wearing but right now 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm married is a disaster because there 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 another person who is a man getting 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 things as well as that getting pulled out happens 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 puts me and I imagine that women who 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.879
 not only are they married but also 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.519
 they have children it was like that worse because you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.969
 minutes and everything is so you know more 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.649
 young 1900 and what good airs I have here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.539
 a towel but right now I'm sitting in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.140
 my towel because you will imagine this sun 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.569
 the ground is very very hot but 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 help still shows my beach bag 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.790
 that I usually change my bone 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.800
 beach but since I have this I have not 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 changed and the reason to be obvious look 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.080
 this 10m 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 the lack and fascinates me 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.580
 they designed it for me in a store that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.260
 it's called I can not machine and they 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 they made my bishops fashionable and I am 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.920
 super fan of them then they made a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.180
 super nice design I in fact 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.460
 I only told them what I wanted them to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.240
 they wrote and the record is like that 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.000
 they did everything else and so then the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.280
 show what I have inside and that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.470
 always note boxes 3 but not 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 only level entities and those of 30 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.880
 posts but for a reason that does not come out 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.730
 those of yesterday so I have other lenses 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 is good because if I had 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.700
 that is my grandmother the titles lenses well 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.020
 that will lend you these and still water and 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.280
 whining and jujuy I'm so 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.010
 normally they need to carry a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.080
 water container but I'm interested 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 they gave it to me I made a mark and in a 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.930
 web page of venezuela aspect yo lo lo 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 use and it keeps me cool and I eat everything 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.180
 much water 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.180
 there are people 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.500
 I have here that if my hotel keys 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 those things are necessary for me but 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 obviously if they give a beach that they give us 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.760
 a hotel 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 the keys to your house kind of things 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.970
 I am very fan of putting everything as in 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.130
 sachets or as small compartments 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.110
 inside the bag then at least 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.360
 the sunscreens I have one 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.670
 bag if this is a ziploc bags 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.320
 anyone is in fact from a store 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.430
 they put a shirt on him and I took it out 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.260
 the shirt and I put the sunscreens 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.760
 but I had as a placket 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.500
 beach and sell by the way too 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.210
 durable that have to be cholita or 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.770
 that if there are other drawings of bathroom and 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.230
 those are the best things because they are 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.300
 as nice but honestly I was damaged 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.000
 and this does exactly the same 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.710
 it probably costs like that a lot 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.960
 because it is costs less money and zero 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.130
 the little bag with the bathing suits is 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.220
 with what 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.810
 I do not know much more but well here I have 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.750
 several sunscreens if whoever 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.520
 I show them my face I have 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 this one for the fat because spray 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.510
 because the fat man does not like me to put him 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.100
 Normal sunscreen I have normal for 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.100
 me bronzer 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.790
 If you're not alone for the lips like 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.480
 that the most important thing on the planet 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.360
 the person is bringing 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 to us 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.870
 and I have it here I do not know why 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.880
 because this is for after like that 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.830
 the community is therefore tanned as 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.180
 to keep your tan really an 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.400
 advance here but like I put it 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.050
 all because the bronzers and the never 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.820
 I'm going to put this graph now for that 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.090
 It seems good idea to have a bag for 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.220
 them but not always wearing a cap 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.020
 because I'm super sensitive with the sun 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.120
 then the hat really for me not 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.930
 have to combine with me or anything has not 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.690
 food with my light 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.690
 look at this little flower work and this one 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.810
 good this bag again 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.590
 but things but the walls of 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.250
 possible and it's like to put things that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.550
 I never took to the beach nor my rings 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.010
 neither my watch nor anything valuable but the 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.350
 fat is a man and he does not learn those 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.150
 things then he decides to take them and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.520
 he gets his friends his watch and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.530
 I feel a place where to put them is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.600
 very nice because it is red and could 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.580
 find everything as very easy to say 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.850
 like it's in the red bag I keep 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.130
 looking there then I have that 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.440
 obviously I do when I leave mixed 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.820
 I need to put my shirts and all this 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.910
 there are obviously two in my beach bag 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.220
 always end that yes shirts is more 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.870
 fat obvious because giant 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.200
 ok I 'm going to show you this I always 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.760
 I have deodorant because I do not think 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.110
 he is always on the beach but he does not use 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.990
 water proof deodorant if you have the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:14.200
 option because the water 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.410
 I do not know sometimes it falls and you do not have like 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.080
 the option to go to your room like this 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.030
 you are all day outside it is necessary 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.399
 touch up I know how much you carry 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.059
 deodorant with you 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:30.680
 I always carry that if the iPad because I 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.379
 like to read like magazines and things like that 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.839
 cost and then obviously the ipad my 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.580
 cell phone my camera but the camera is 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:40.159
 there and I'll take you from the camera to do 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.990
 blogs right now I'm going to record part I'm 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.189
 recording blogs that were on my channel 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.740
 personal and I also have on my iphone 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.599
 when we write like this on the beach I have a 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.879
 waterproof hat and I've 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.740
 asked full for this I am is 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:57.050
 lets take first lets me 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.849
 keep my iphone protected in the 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.589
 sense of not worrying if it comes to me 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.599
 to fall into the water or if it reaches me 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.069
 fill anything with sand 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.539
 nothing will happen to him and apart from serving 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.089
 take pictures under the water that are 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.339
 super cute and it's like something different and you 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.709
 allows how to enjoy more and have the 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:15.139
 people that are involved in how this 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:16.759
 kayak or windsurf you can take the iphone 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.559
 move at your own risk because good 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.180
 you can fall and lose though like this 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.280
 it floats a little but 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.350
 it's like just extra protection 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.669
 and to take more fun pictures 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.120
 obviously you have a camera type one 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.310
 buy or better for you but if it's not you 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.139
 much cheaper option and of all 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.180
 ways when taking super cool pictures 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.500
 then emergent sells it for me to 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.060
 car phones that use how 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.500
 program jacob and now finally I 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.539
 because I'm running a hotel another 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.919
 time and that's why I have this but I 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.199
 I always need my bags 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.539
 When I leave, I close my bags with 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.230
 padlocks even if you have nothing and the 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:57.220
 I close in case the keys 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:59.800
 something that I do and is fat that brings your 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.960
 portfolio that is my portfolio in the 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.510
 hotel room because I do not know to me 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.680
 I do not like to be with the portfolio over 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.500
 igualito note because it is all inclusive 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.200
 I do not need money although I appreciate that 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.420
 the fat man brings his wallet because 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.950
 if when you want to buy as a thing 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.480
 extra that if you want to ride in the 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.330
 banana or do you want to do anything 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.980
 additional is worth having a portfolio 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.720
 because where will the room run 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.210
 usual then if that's 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.530
 exactly what I have to spend are 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.450
 too many things because we serve you 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.880
 it's too heavy even if it gets heavy 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.070
 when you multiply that if the ipad by two 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.900
 to the cell phone by two is like much more 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.180
 camera weight by two but good to 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.280
 you let me have you in your bag 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.600
 beach and if you want to go through half of the 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.890
 staff to see what everything has 

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.480
 conquered by doing here we are in 

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.950
 Dominican republic we have spent it very 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.950
 very rich comes with my whole family 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.120
 yes
