00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.970
 Hello, holiday on February 23 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.570
 and I want to suggest 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.780
 do here such a otkrytochku 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.520
 postcard you can put some 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:29.439
 small gift size depends on 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.450
 paper size this is the usual copier 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:36.060
 I'm on paper here is such a shirt 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:40.650
 it turns out already more 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.410
 I took a leaf here I stuck looking for 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:50.200
 such a vest tie inside can 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 write a wish that's what 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:06.549
 we need to take a sheet of paper 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:10.240
 the middle is slightly pressed with one 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 sides and to this middle we turn 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.869
 our leaf 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.480
 and from this side also 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.810
 like this 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 then we take a little corner wrap 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:57.580
 here and on the other hand now every 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.790
 from the corners 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.100
 again this triangle to 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:10.170
 to schedule a little girl so that later we were 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 convenient to bend that is pressing again 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:34.769
 so here is a little bit of this triangle 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:34.769
 and on the other hand do the same now 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.860
 Here at the expense of these bends that we did 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.890
 it is convenient to fold the leaf now 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:57.250
 in this way it will be our sleeves 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:58.500
 shirt and press so do now 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 collar 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.730
 turn over from the back here 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.000
 we bent inward here to complex close 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.790
 to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.840
 and here it is on the other side where exactly 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.720
 and we have literally a centimeter and a half 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.940
 two maximum enough essay on such 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.940
 Leaf it will be a collar 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.630
 roll up the pack 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.620
 then turn over and now here are two 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:49.400
 our 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:56.930
 edge of the region as if to each other and 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:04:00.439
 we press it our collar and now 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.439
 this edge 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.720
 we turn off and let down as if 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.180
 turnout he will keep our 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:24.630
 little shirt 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:25.580
 so align it 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.880
 we have 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:35.370
 shirt here we can glue the tie 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:41.400
 cut out of paper that's how day is here 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:47.280
 tie can glue vest 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.199
 on top of the vest glue and you can just 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.810
 here's how to take this shirt 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.639
 to draw 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.639
 marker marker that is anything 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:06.770
 take a pencil and draw a tie 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:33.590
 so about here it turns out a tie and 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:36.970
 You can draw the usual marker here 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:43.039
 so it turns out so pretty 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.650
 shirt here can also write 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.750
 some wish you can just 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.810
 draw February 23 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.979
 as if you can make a pocket 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.840
 you can make a pocket here and write 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:02.210
