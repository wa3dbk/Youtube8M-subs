 plug in the plug longer 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.640

 the lower camera offers a little more 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.949
 through our camera the drone keeps the position 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:15.749
 if you do not control Ergo it's dark the drone has a slight problem 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.859
 slightly on the second third 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.259

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.429
 disabled 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.889
