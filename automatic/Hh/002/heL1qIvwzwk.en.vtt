00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
that's back when I realized that hey I

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.509 
that's back when I realized that hey I
don't<00:00:39.260> have<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.530> build<00:00:39.769> the<00:00:39.980> model<00:00:40.280> exactly

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
don't have to build the model exactly

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.939 
don't have to build the model exactly
the<00:00:40.789> way<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:40.940> directions<00:00:41.480> showed<00:00:41.839> I<00:00:42.170> can<00:00:42.829> make

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
the way the directions showed I can make

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.930 
the way the directions showed I can make
it<00:00:43.070> my<00:00:43.190> own<00:00:43.219> thing<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:45.320> pretty<00:00:45.589> much

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
it my own thing and I pretty much

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.840 
it my own thing and I pretty much
decided<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.359> throw<00:00:47.899> together<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.379> rat<00:00:48.649> rod<00:00:48.859> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850

this isn't how exactly I feel how I

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.739 
this isn't how exactly I feel how I
built<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:52.339> the<00:00:52.429> first<00:00:52.640> time<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.179> added<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.719> few

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749

things<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:55.719> this<00:00:56.719> is<00:00:56.780> how<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.409> originally<00:00:57.829> I

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
things to it this is how it originally I

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.950 
things to it this is how it originally I
built<00:00:58.760> it<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.089> how<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.269> model<00:01:02.629> sets

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960

tires and I fixed up the rough spots a
little<00:01:18.170> bit<00:01:18.290> gave<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:18.590> more<00:01:19.420> depth<00:01:20.979> by<00:01:21.979> adding

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
little bit gave it more depth by adding

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.420 
little bit gave it more depth by adding
some<00:01:23.950> particles<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.899> bed<00:01:27.140> all<00:01:28.040> road

kit

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
kit

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:44.770 
kit
it's<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:37.090> DeSoto<00:01:39.759> teeth<00:01:40.759> grille<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.570> said

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's the DeSoto teeth grille like I said

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.770

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
is the from the mercury kits the DeSoto

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.230 
is the from the mercury kits the DeSoto
I<00:01:47.890> think<00:01:48.890> most<00:01:49.039> often<00:01:49.159> DeSoto<00:01:49.609> those<00:01:49.880> teeth

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I think most often DeSoto those teeth

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.300 
I think most often DeSoto those teeth
the<00:01:50.990> front<00:01:51.259> grille<00:01:51.469> from<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.710> DeSoto<00:01:51.979> that

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310
