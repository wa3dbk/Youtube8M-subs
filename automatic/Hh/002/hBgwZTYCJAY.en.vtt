00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
this three anytime but because of the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.630 
this three anytime but because of the
max<00:01:34.900> effort<00:01:35.320> or<00:01:35.470> near<00:01:35.740> max<00:01:35.950> effort<00:01:36.280> attempt

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
max effort or near max effort attempt

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.110 
max effort or near max effort attempt
that<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:36.910> take<00:01:37.150> on<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.540> cut<00:01:38.350> alley<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.850> makes

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
that I take on the cut alley that makes

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.700 
that I take on the cut alley that makes
this<00:01:40.300> gripper<00:01:40.660> harder<00:01:40.990> because<00:01:41.200> I'm<00:01:41.350> already

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this gripper harder because I'm already

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.730 
this gripper harder because I'm already
pre<00:01:42.130> exhausted<00:01:42.760> I<00:01:42.910> have<00:01:43.150> left<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.900> have<00:01:44.500> less

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
pre exhausted I have left I have less

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.630 
pre exhausted I have left I have less
left<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.370> tank<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.940> hit<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.450> one<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.520> it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
left in the tank to hit this one and it

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.550 
left in the tank to hit this one and it
really<00:01:48.820> changes<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.420> gripper<00:01:49.750> up<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.380> it's<00:01:50.500> a

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
really changes the gripper up and it's a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:01.310 
really changes the gripper up and it's a
much<00:01:50.740> more<00:01:50.890> difficult

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380
