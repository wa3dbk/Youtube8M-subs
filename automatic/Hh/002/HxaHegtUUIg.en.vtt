00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Good. Let's start the makeup. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 first I will apply a moisturizer to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:15.630
 face with sun protection factor 30 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 of the natura chronos I apply on the cheek 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.080
 on my chin, on my forehead and on my forehead, so that I 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.080
 can spread and from there to the whole face 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 So I choose well and then I came with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 a step that is super professional that is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 the first israel first source hd 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.270
 People, I pass by more precisely. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 because I have a course and so on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 I do not just stay in school and then I go 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 Go home, I'll go on others. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.989
 Places it is necessary that makeup last for 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.000
 I do not like to touch up 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.320
 so I advance in the same places 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 that I passed 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.719
 the sunscreen and a corset tap 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.090
 too corrective does not want that blush 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.570
 so that the pores and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 such 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.659
 so this is it now I came with concealer 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.549
 I will apply the light color 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 in my girls' circles is 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.840
 collective or not dispensing morning I 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.610
 I always liked to apply a corrective 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.710
 generally apply only to goalkeepers but 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.720
 Do you have a little bar that you need 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 a correction of a little bit of 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.740
 camouflage and I end up also passing 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 But today was not the case, it's okay. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 The next thing I do is the power. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.920
 ruth people this is the top in color 01 ta 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
 I apply it with the sponge because I 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.610
 I like a little more coverage in the area. 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.009
 of the collective since I ended up passing 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.229
 a thicker layer of product that does not 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.119
 if it was the corrective then I applied 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.390
 giving a few tapping so that the product 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 look good in my eye 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 this is a little trick I love 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 do what I think you've already lied to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.090
 You're the bread a little clearer. 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.860
 is we are in the area of dark circles it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.469
 It's really lighter, but I like it. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.049
 to emphasize this place for 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.509

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.550
 also only that it debuts in the darker color 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.250
 he is in cosern 12 that is why the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.320
 packaging is different but I get the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.440
 brush and apply it all over the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.440
