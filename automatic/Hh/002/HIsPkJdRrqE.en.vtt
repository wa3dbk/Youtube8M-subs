many<00:02:03.270> measures<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.439> course<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:05.219> first

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
many measures now of course the first

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.449 
many measures now of course the first
budget<00:02:05.819> of<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.299> cycle<00:02:06.779> is<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.649> time<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.160> do

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.509 
budget of a cycle is the time to do
things<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:10.080> fine<00:02:10.500> line<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
things but it's a pretty fine line as to

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.660 
things but it's a pretty fine line as to
how<00:02:11.670> much<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.260> carry<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.890> public

wrong with you and of course there's

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.470

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
things he does you turn somersaults

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.590 
things he does you turn somersaults
whatever<00:04:59.190> but<00:05:00.090> Al<00:05:00.450> Gore<00:05:00.930> being<00:05:01.530> there<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:02.600> just

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
whatever but Al Gore being there is just

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.280 
whatever but Al Gore being there is just
amazing<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.910> inexplicable<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.090> think<00:05:06.540> now<00:05:07.260> you

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
amazing and inexplicable I think now you

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.490 
amazing and inexplicable I think now you
could<00:05:07.740> say<00:05:08.040> that<00:05:08.340> he<00:05:08.760> sees<00:05:09.030> this<00:05:09.240> as<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:10.020> chance

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
could say that he sees this as a chance

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.280 
could say that he sees this as a chance
for<00:05:10.680> Australia<00:05:11.340> not<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:11.970> go<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.420> far<00:05:12.450> backwards

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
for Australia not to go so far backwards

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.940 
for Australia not to go so far backwards
on<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:14.210> policy<00:05:15.210> on<00:05:15.330> this<00:05:15.510> issue<00:05:15.750> as<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.770> might

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
on this policy on this issue as it might

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.030 
on this policy on this issue as it might
otherwise<00:05:17.460> without<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.750> Palmer<00:05:19.290> compromise

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
otherwise without the Palmer compromise

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.290 
otherwise without the Palmer compromise
but<00:05:20.670> that's<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.120> only<00:05:21.660> way<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.140> can<00:05:22.670> even<00:05:23.670> start

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
but that's the only way I can even start

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.750 
but that's the only way I can even start
to<00:05:24.720> give<00:05:25.080> an<00:05:25.200> explanation<00:05:25.470> for<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.700> the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
to give an explanation for this and the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.180 
to give an explanation for this and the
amazing<00:05:27.240> thing<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.930> apparently<00:05:28.890> the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
amazing thing is that apparently the

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.250 
amazing thing is that apparently the
overtures<00:05:29.730> came<00:05:30.300> from<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.660> gore<00:05:30.900> camp

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
overtures came from the gore camp

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.740 
overtures came from the gore camp
initially<00:05:31.890> in<00:05:32.040> discussions<00:05:32.670> have<00:05:33.210> been<00:05:33.240> going

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
initially in discussions have been going

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.430 
initially in discussions have been going
on<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.410> some<00:05:34.590> weeks<00:05:34.890> but<00:05:35.610> it's<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.440> very

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
on for some weeks but it's a very

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.890 
on for some weeks but it's a very
strange<00:05:38.090> phenomenon<00:05:39.090> from<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.510> gore

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
strange phenomenon from the gore

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.940 
strange phenomenon from the gore
perspective<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.640> then<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.630> issue

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
perspective and then to the to the issue

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.400 
perspective and then to the to the issue
itself<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:44.670> seems<00:05:45.030> therefore<00:05:45.420> that<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:46.020> Prime

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
itself it seems therefore that the Prime

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.080 
itself it seems therefore that the Prime
Minister<00:05:46.710> will<00:05:46.920> get<00:05:47.160> his<00:05:47.280> way<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.700> carbon<00:05:48.060> tax

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
Minister will get his way the carbon tax

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.860 
Minister will get his way the carbon tax
will<00:05:48.600> be<00:05:48.920> repealed<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:51.300> you<00:05:51.510> say<00:05:51.720> in<00:05:51.810> your

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
will be repealed but you say in your

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.810 
will be repealed but you say in your
article<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.620> this<00:05:52.830> is<00:05:52.980> possibly<00:05:53.370> not<00:05:53.580> high

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
article that this is possibly not high

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.550 
article that this is possibly not high
on<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.450> list<00:05:54.480> of<00:05:54.780> concerns<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.410> the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
on the list of concerns of the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.740 
on the list of concerns of the
electorate<00:05:55.920> now<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.490> don't<00:05:56.760> know<00:05:57.000> whether<00:05:57.150> the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
electorate now I don't know whether the

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.860 
electorate now I don't know whether the
mood<00:05:57.930> is<00:05:58.080> changing<00:05:58.560> about<00:05:58.770> climate<00:05:59.870> generally

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
mood is changing about climate generally

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.050 
mood is changing about climate generally
but<00:06:01.170> it's<00:06:01.470> been<00:06:01.740> possibly<00:06:02.280> displaced<00:06:02.790> by

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
but it's been possibly displaced by

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.230 
but it's been possibly displaced by
other<00:06:03.330> issues<00:06:03.750> so<00:06:04.020> it's<00:06:04.790> it's<00:06:05.790> more<00:06:06.000> going

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
other issues so it's it's more going

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.810 
other issues so it's it's more going
into<00:06:06.480> this<00:06:06.600> than<00:06:06.810> is<00:06:06.960> necessary<00:06:07.170> for

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
into this than is necessary for

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.610 
into this than is necessary for
electoral<00:06:08.820> purposes<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.930> does<00:06:10.230> seem<00:06:10.590> that

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
electoral purposes it does seem that

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.100 
electoral purposes it does seem that

now<00:06:15.780> I'm<00:06:15.960> not<00:06:16.140> saying<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:16.530> people<00:06:16.920> won't<00:06:17.100> say

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
now I'm not saying that people won't say

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.650 
now I'm not saying that people won't say
oh<00:06:17.490> well<00:06:17.850> if<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.750> carbon<00:06:19.380> tax<00:06:19.410> is<00:06:19.740> removed<00:06:20.220> and

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
oh well if the carbon tax is removed and

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.020 
oh well if the carbon tax is removed and
electricity<00:06:21.660> prices<00:06:22.310> benefit<00:06:23.310> as<00:06:23.460> a<00:06:23.490> result

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
electricity prices benefit as a result

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.790 
electricity prices benefit as a result
from<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.360> consumer<00:06:24.870> point<00:06:25.380> of<00:06:25.560> view<00:06:25.770> that

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
from the consumer point of view that

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.830 
from the consumer point of view that
they<00:06:26.430> won't<00:06:26.580> welcome<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.360> I<00:06:27.390> think<00:06:27.750> they

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
they won't welcome that I think they

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.860 
they won't welcome that I think they
probably<00:06:28.020> will<00:06:28.620> but<00:06:29.220> i<00:06:29.490> also<00:06:29.790> think<00:06:30.510> from

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
probably will but i also think from

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.140 
probably will but i also think from
recent<00:06:31.380> polls<00:06:31.680> we're<00:06:32.070> seeing<00:06:32.340> people<00:06:32.670> more

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
recent polls we're seeing people more

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.270 
recent polls we're seeing people more
engaged<00:06:33.360> on<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.410> climate<00:06:34.800> change<00:06:35.070> issue

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
engaged on the climate change issue

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.600 
engaged on the climate change issue
again<00:06:36.030> after<00:06:36.660> a<00:06:36.720> declined<00:06:37.350> when<00:06:37.830> everyone

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
again after a declined when everyone

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.580 
again after a declined when everyone
felt<00:06:38.880> under<00:06:39.150> financial<00:06:39.360> pressure

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
felt under financial pressure

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.370 
felt under financial pressure
in<00:06:40.680> a<00:06:40.740> global<00:06:41.430> financial<00:06:41.790> crisis<00:06:42.450> and<00:06:42.480> it's

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
in a global financial crisis and it's

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.490 
in a global financial crisis and it's
aftermath<00:06:43.730> so<00:06:44.730> I<00:06:44.760> don't<00:06:45.210> think<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.930> carbon

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
aftermath so I don't think the carbon

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.600 
aftermath so I don't think the carbon
issue<00:06:47.210> carbon<00:06:48.210> repeal<00:06:48.690> issue<00:06:48.900> is<00:06:49.400> nearly<00:06:50.400> as

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
issue carbon repeal issue is nearly as

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.940 
issue carbon repeal issue is nearly as
big<00:06:50.850> as<00:06:51.090> it<00:06:51.240> was<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:51.480> few<00:06:51.690> years<00:06:51.900> ago<00:06:52.200> and<00:06:52.680> I

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
big as it was a few years ago and I

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.160 
big as it was a few years ago and I
think<00:06:53.220> people<00:06:53.460> are<00:06:54.120> likely<00:06:54.450> to<00:06:54.690> be<00:06:54.840> more

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
think people are likely to be more

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.310 
think people are likely to be more
concerned<00:06:55.820> with<00:06:56.820> the<00:06:57.360> budget<00:06:57.540> issues<00:06:58.080> have

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
concerned with the budget issues have

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.130 
concerned with the budget issues have
those<00:06:58.530> top<00:06:58.890> of<00:06:59.100> mind<00:06:59.460> rather<00:07:00.180> than<00:07:00.300> the<00:07:00.540> carbon

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
those top of mind rather than the carbon

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.240 
those top of mind rather than the carbon
issue<00:07:01.380> at<00:07:01.890> the<00:07:02.400> moment<00:07:02.510> but<00:07:03.680> nevertheless<00:07:04.680> the

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
issue at the moment but nevertheless the

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.460 
issue at the moment but nevertheless the
liberals<00:07:05.700> are<00:07:05.940> hanging<00:07:06.270> their<00:07:06.450> hats<00:07:06.690> on<00:07:07.050> this

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
liberals are hanging their hats on this

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.150 
liberals are hanging their hats on this
I<00:07:07.740> think<00:07:08.340> that<00:07:08.580> Clive<00:07:09.150> Palmer<00:07:09.510> has<00:07:10.260> delivered

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
I think that Clive Palmer has delivered

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.330 
I think that Clive Palmer has delivered
to<00:07:11.790> them<00:07:12.060> in<00:07:12.240> that<00:07:12.930> the<00:07:13.110> condition<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:13.800> he's

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
to them in that the condition that he's

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.730 
to them in that the condition that he's
put<00:07:14.730> on<00:07:14.760> for<00:07:15.210> the<00:07:15.300> repeal<00:07:15.780> that<00:07:15.990> they<00:07:16.470> have<00:07:16.620> to

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
put on for the repeal that they have to

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.400 
put on for the repeal that they have to
be<00:07:16.860> guarantees<00:07:17.640> that<00:07:17.670> the<00:07:18.330> benefits<00:07:18.780> will<00:07:19.260> be
