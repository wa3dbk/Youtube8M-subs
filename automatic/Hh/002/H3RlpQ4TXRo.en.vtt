and as you can see this has that swype
keyboard<00:01:22.320> built-in<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> first

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
keyboard built-in now this is the first

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.840 
keyboard built-in now this is the first
time<00:01:24.270> I've<00:01:24.450> used<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> swype<00:01:25.080> keyboard<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.860> have

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
time I've used the swype keyboard I have

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
time I've used the swype keyboard I have
been<00:01:27.479> reading<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.440> looked<00:01:28.740> at

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
been reading about it and have looked at

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
been reading about it and have looked at
it<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> past<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.880> never<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.270> had<00:01:30.539> an

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it in the past but never actually had an

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
it in the past but never actually had an
opportunity<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.170> use<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.649> first<00:01:31.830> hand<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.250> I'll

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
opportunity to use it first hand so I'll

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
opportunity to use it first hand so I'll
not<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.700> expert<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.320> some<00:01:34.530> demo

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
not be expert but with just some demo

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
not be expert but with just some demo
time<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.300> before<00:01:36.450> filming<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
time I did right before filming this it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
time I did right before filming this it
worked<00:01:37.649> pretty<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.670> we'll<00:01:38.850> say<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.360> try

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
worked pretty well so we'll say will try

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:49.170 
worked pretty well so we'll say will try
to<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.720> welcome<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> show<00:01:40.409> again

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.350 

and<00:01:49.900> that<00:01:50.530> worked<00:01:50.680> pretty<00:01:50.890> well<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.640> fact<00:01:52.120> i

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
and that worked pretty well in fact i

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.030 
and that worked pretty well in fact i
was<00:01:52.720> actually<00:01:52.900> also<00:01:53.230> able<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.590> get<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.860> do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
was actually also able to get it to do

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.610 
was actually also able to get it to do
my<00:01:54.160> name<00:01:59.310> did<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.460> with<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.700> first<00:02:01.030> try

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
my name did that with the first try

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.710 
my name did that with the first try
which<00:02:02.620> is<00:02:02.770> pretty<00:02:02.950> nice<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.060> swipe<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.479> really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
which is pretty nice so swipe is really

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.550 
which is pretty nice so swipe is really
a<00:02:04.750> good<00:02:04.930> thing<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.290> i<00:02:05.500> think<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> works<00:02:06.340> in

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a good thing and i think it works in

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.350 
a good thing and i think it works in
horizontal<00:02:08.560> orientation<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.340> well<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:10.149> if<00:02:10.240> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
horizontal orientation as well so if you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
horizontal orientation as well so if you
wanted<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.840> say<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.400> weather<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:17.490> nice

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
wanted to say like the weather is nice

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.320 
wanted to say like the weather is nice
you<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.160> ahead<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.209> can

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
you go ahead and do that so as you can

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.180 
you go ahead and do that so as you can
see<00:02:22.480> swipe<00:02:22.810> works<00:02:23.050> really<00:02:23.260> well<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.739> it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
see swipe works really well and it's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.310 
see swipe works really well and it's
been<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.550> efficient<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:26.200> think

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
been really efficient I really think

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
with the physical and i made a little

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.449 
with the physical and i made a little
mistake<00:02:49.270> there<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.020> i<00:02:50.200> tribute<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.220> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
being at a weird angle to film this I

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.420 
being at a weird angle to film this I
really<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.610> had<00:02:55.120> no<00:02:55.480> problems<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:57.250> this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430

keyboard<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.299> my<00:02:59.260> tests<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:01.870> really

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
keyboard in my tests I think it's really

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.440 
keyboard in my tests I think it's really
a<00:03:02.110> nice<00:03:02.260> thing<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> physical<00:03:03.670> board

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.810 

just<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:08.830> makes<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.160> really<00:03:09.310> easy<00:03:09.430> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
just because it makes it really easy and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.060 
just because it makes it really easy and
unique<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.080> able<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.320> quickly<00:03:11.530> type<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
unique to be able to quickly type and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.210 
unique to be able to quickly type and
use<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.269> that's<00:03:14.019> text<00:03:14.440> input<00:03:14.769> as<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.070> can

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
use it so that's text input as you can

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.470 
use it so that's text input as you can
see<00:03:15.600> there<00:03:16.600> are<00:03:16.630> three<00:03:16.780> great<00:03:17.470> input<00:03:18.480> methods

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
see there are three great input methods

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.759 
see there are three great input methods
