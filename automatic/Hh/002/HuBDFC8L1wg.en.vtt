00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 the center for clinical skills 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
 the veterinary college of Hanover 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.160
 poses in this video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.870
 Intravenous injection at the dog there 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.179
 the venen Verwaltter consists of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.090
 an external plastic cannula 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.080
 and an inner longer metal 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.939
 cannula or dare called that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.859
 lay the peripheral as the administrator 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.199
 The culprit should first be on the board 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 be demonstrated 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.620
 with the inside mantra is the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.719
 hose then please dab on it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 fixed with the fingers and the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.760
 External plastic catheter becomes 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.480
 the fitter pushed into the hose 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.309
 itself is removed 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 for iv injection, the following are 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 things are needed like an administrator 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.199
 swabs and disinfectants one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 scissors a fixe her and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.770
 be further plaster strips 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 inject as well as a heparin-containing 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 sodium chloride solution and a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 Waste container needed for the oral cavity 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 Will not by a second person 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.360
 manually jammed must also be a traffic jam 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 hose ready to be laid 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.700
 and last but not least is one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.189
 Shaving machine necessary for shaving 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 first two strips of plaster 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.470
 The paved strip is prepared 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 its folded and it becomes one 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.060
 Notch cut into this process 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.900
 becomes the second plaster strip 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.900
 repeated 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.350
 afterwards it will be the fixed one 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.630
 your bandage will be ready yours too 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 folded twice and it will be two 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 cuts set 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 The dog will be from another person 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.590
 the viennese are dotted 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.150
 Decay icca attached their course 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.150
 she represents very well here 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.320
 First, the hair on the front leg 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.320
 Shorn with a shearing machine 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.900
 then this skin areal 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 disinfected 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:26.370
 the offender as well as the offender gets out 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:29.209
 his packaging and so on 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.209
 kept correct 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.370
 the lock will be removed and 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.880
 ready to hand laid the front 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.030
 Sheathing is removed 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.220
 the second person holding the dog 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.170
 it also fixes the elbow joint 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.550
 and at the same time the vein with the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.530
 fumble 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.320
 with the left hand is the leg 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.950
 fixes the skin while being stretched so that 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.780
 The vein remains in its position 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.540
 with which one dream becomes the vein 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.160
 The man is dotted with blood 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.989
 fixed on it and the outside 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.069
 Plastic catheter will continue into the 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.069
 vein advanced 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.020
 From this perspective, it is easy to see 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.700
 as the plastic catheter advanced 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.360
 and at the same time the man was behind 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.360
 is fixed 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.060
 the man is now in the 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.700
 disposed of waste container 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.080
 the traffic jam is lifted under them 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.900
 denied offenders will be with the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.450
 cap closed 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.410
 dripped blood with a swab of 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.410
 hide away 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.570
 now he is denied because of the 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.550
 plaster strip fixes the openings 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.300
 in the plaster strips are over the 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.300
 connections 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.920
 after the plaster strip is the 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.040
 fixation de created here too 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.599
 the openings again over the connections 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.009
 appropriate 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.750
 after laying the bandage 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.300
 consistency and correct position 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.550
 Check with saline with 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.550
 heparin is injected 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.970
 the fixe her bandage has the advantage that 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.400
 it is slightly elastic and self-adhesive 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.750
 that means in the end the bandage has to be 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.750
 no longer be stuck firmly 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:23.120
 at the conclusion for the distance 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.120
 because of this manager demonstrated 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.580
 for that will be a plaster strip 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.980
 prepared and folded several times 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.790
 swabs will stick to this plaster 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.790
 glued 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.320
 Now the bandage is removed carefully 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.129
 and subsequently also the 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.129
 plaster strips 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.039
 the venen Verwaltiger will now 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:24.539
 pulled and on the puncture site is 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.539
 the prepared plaster glued
