00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.229
 hands fairly coarse pieces 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.990
 mouldable I make a lament and e 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.780

 in my speeches they are ready but ranieri 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.180
 I frame them as I consider them Turin 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.750
 shame that they can not smell 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.209
 youtube should make you feel calm 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.280

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.329
 about a 25 minutes 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.489
 look under this color mi 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.079
