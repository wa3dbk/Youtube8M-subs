possibility of being OB and it will take

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.870 
possibility of being OB and it will take
them<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.930> lot<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.560> time<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.040> figure<00:04:49.310> out<00:04:49.490> what

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
them a lot of time to figure out what

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.400 
them a lot of time to figure out what
they're<00:04:50.090> gonna<00:04:50.210> do<00:04:50.480> right<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:51.140> when<00:04:51.320> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
they're gonna do right like when the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.980 
they're gonna do right like when the
little<00:04:51.620> Kakashi's<00:04:52.160> jutsu<00:04:52.790> or<00:04:53.030> whiskey<00:04:53.720> ba

this<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.560> all<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:55.310> requiring<00:04:55.790> casting

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
this is all that is requiring casting

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.290 
this is all that is requiring casting
that's<00:04:57.260> why<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.800> story<00:04:58.040> mode<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.730> basically

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
that's why the story mode is basically

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.450 
that's why the story mode is basically
separated<00:05:00.110> into<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.530> three<00:05:00.800> story<00:05:01.130> lines

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
separated into the three story lines

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.270 
separated into the three story lines
like<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:02.060> got<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.470> Akatsuki<00:05:03.470> backstory<00:05:04.040> look

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
like we got the Akatsuki backstory look

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.370 
like we got the Akatsuki backstory look
at<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.580> tournament<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.420> mecha<00:05:05.690> Naruto

at this tournament and mecha Naruto

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.490 
at this tournament and mecha Naruto
which<00:05:06.980> is<00:05:07.190> having<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.240> possibility<00:05:09.170> of<00:05:09.230> being

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
which is having a possibility of being

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.600 
which is having a possibility of being
op2<00:05:10.190> by<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.490> way<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:12.080> other<00:05:12.740> star<00:05:13.280> line

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
op2 by the way and this other star line

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.060 
op2 by the way and this other star line
which<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:13.970> supposed<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.660> go<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.260> continue<00:05:15.830> the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
which is supposed to go and continue the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.490 
which is supposed to go and continue the
stir<00:05:16.250> line<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.640> some<00:05:16.940> three<00:05:17.270> which<00:05:17.960> we<00:05:18.140> haven't

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
stir line of some three which we haven't

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.590 
stir line of some three which we haven't
seen<00:05:18.710> any<00:05:19.010> kind<00:05:19.250> of<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.460> screenshot<00:05:19.790> or<00:05:20.120> trailer

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
seen any kind of a screenshot or trailer

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.760 
seen any kind of a screenshot or trailer
yet<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.890> we<00:05:22.490> can<00:05:22.640> get<00:05:22.820> base<00:05:23.090> on<00:05:23.450> that<00:05:23.690> some<00:05:24.620> of

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
yet so we can get base on that some of

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.680 
yet so we can get base on that some of
this<00:05:24.920> whole<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.460> up<00:05:25.670> there's<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.090> lot<00:05:26.450> of

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this whole thing up there's a lot of

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.960 
this whole thing up there's a lot of
uncertainty<00:05:27.620> about<00:05:27.800> this<00:05:28.250> game<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.940> think

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
uncertainty about this game and I think

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.900 
uncertainty about this game and I think
