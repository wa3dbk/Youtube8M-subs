00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 such a level of service for a 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.850
 departmental library is a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880

 it's a free service for 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 users development and support 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.690
 public reading are part of 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.330
 skills of the General Council and this is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.150
 as such the community has 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.510
 wished to propose this offer to 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.220
 special 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.070
 we are partners of the communes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.920
 since the municipalities and communities of 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.860
 will remain in their role 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.610
 first of relations with users 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.590
 the Landes will have to access 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.410
 this resource be listed in a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.510
 public library of the department and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
 they will have to have a word of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.380
 login password to contact 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.680
 inquire at their library 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.060
 for an audience that, for example, does not have 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.650
 a little time to get to his 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.959
 public library is rather 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 available in the evening the library goes 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.650
 offer him a public service an offer 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.390
 cultural in the times that him 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.970
 agree so we try to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.730
 complete the service that is offered to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 the used me I am convinced that more 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.360
 we offer more culture the public in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.489
 sum of culture so if we give it 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.739
 access to other mediums of others 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.239
 content he will always be present for 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.780
 come consume culture to the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.010
 media 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.330
 so that's actually an offer 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.000
 complementary is not an offer 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.160
 competitive so the public if he 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.720
 consumes beyond the digital that will also 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.400
 consumed paper he will discover the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
 services of the media library and any 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760
 the challenge is to be 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.930
 registered to the media library to access 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 media landes 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.860
 so that's an extra asset 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.600
 for our landes media is the fruit of 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.400
 more time for consultation between the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.350
 departmental library and several 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.150
 departmental media library network 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.829
 the media platform landes allows 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.069
 users to know the agenda of 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.049
 cultural actions proposed by any 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.420
 library to consult a catalog 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.609
 collective departmental book 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.069
 documents and manage his readers account 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.849
 a new practice for maybe a 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.219
 new audience 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.109
 in reality so we mostly have children 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.790
 and adults and their resources 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.129
 digital may be able to make you 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.420
 touching teenagers who do not 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.549
 media libraries and which already have 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.620
 practices elsewhere on the internet 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.150
 not necessarily legal so there the withdrawal 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.870
 will allow us to get into a frame 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.430
 legal with media landes the public of 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.599
 one of the thousand and aix and the people all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.060
 people it's you it's me 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.919
 so we wait what we expect in 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.359
 our everyday life so the audience of the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.060
 media library he is waiting for an offer that is 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.460
 effective modern that is in the air of 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 time so we will not change the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.479
 publicly will improve what we are going 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.190
 offer to the public here is it is possible 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.229
 as we hope in any case here 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.750
 we can rejuvenate it a little bit 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.060
 we capture it is this young audience between 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.860
 15 25 years that traditionally he we 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.990
 is difficult to touch so with a 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.389
 very modern offer very very digital 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.280
 we hope to conquer her she touches 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.330
 even more media moors is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.050
 complementary 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.849
 who
