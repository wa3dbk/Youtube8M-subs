500<00:03:13.550> gigabytes<00:03:14.830> now<00:03:15.830> that<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.100> had<00:03:16.250> was<00:03:16.370> 250<00:03:16.850> so

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
500 gigabytes now that I had was 250 so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.340 
500 gigabytes now that I had was 250 so
it's<00:03:17.210> a<00:03:17.300> huge<00:03:17.750> jump<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.350> terms<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.370> space<00:03:20.350> and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
it's a huge jump in terms of space and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.890 
it's a huge jump in terms of space and
open<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.680> up<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.570> other<00:03:23.600> unboxing

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
open it up so like the other unboxing

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.570 
open it up so like the other unboxing
I'm<00:03:26.900> gonna<00:03:27.080> open<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.470> from<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> side<00:03:28.310> like

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
I'm gonna open it from the side like

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.900 
I'm gonna open it from the side like
this<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:29.090> can<00:03:29.270> see<00:03:29.650> see<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.550> can<00:03:31.610> see<00:03:31.700> how
