00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.619 

hi<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:01.860> gonna<00:00:02.100> be<00:00:02.310> downsizing<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.570> to

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hi guys so I'm gonna be downsizing my to

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi guys so I'm gonna be downsizing my to
gauge<00:00:04.110> plug<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:05.330> decided<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.540> downsize<00:00:06.720> my<00:00:07.319> plug

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
gauge plug I decided to downsize my plug

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.810 
gauge plug I decided to downsize my plug
because<00:00:08.490> I'm<00:00:09.860> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.219> stretching<00:00:11.490> my

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
because I'm going to be stretching my

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.079 
because I'm going to be stretching my
lower<00:00:12.090> holes<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> 10<00:00:13.769> mil<00:00:14.040> from<00:00:14.580> both<00:00:14.790> sides

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
lower holes to a 10 mil from both sides

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.980 
lower holes to a 10 mil from both sides
so<00:00:16.609> downsizing<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> top<00:00:18.090> par<00:00:18.330> will<00:00:18.600> probably

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
so downsizing the top par will probably

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.960 
so downsizing the top par will probably
give<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.949> buttonholes<00:00:20.430> more<00:00:20.670> room<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
give the buttonholes more room to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.769 
give the buttonholes more room to
stretch<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> 2<00:00:24.180> gauge<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
stretch so this is a 2 gauge at the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.740 
stretch so this is a 2 gauge at the
moment<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:26.099> gonna<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.519> downsizing<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
moment and I'm gonna be downsizing to a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.620 
moment and I'm gonna be downsizing to a
6<00:00:28.109> gauge<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.640> using<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.359> pink

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
6 gauge so I'm going to be using my pink

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
6 gauge so I'm going to be using my pink
silicon<00:00:31.230> tunnel<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.250> I'll<00:00:32.820> put<00:00:33.059> all

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
silicon tunnel for this one I'll put all

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940 
silicon tunnel for this one I'll put all
the<00:00:33.239> links<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> description<00:00:33.930> box<00:00:34.620> and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
start off with clean washed hands so I'm

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
start off with clean washed hands so I'm
gonna<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.100> existing<00:00:42.000> plugs<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.510> are

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
gonna take my existing plugs that are

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
gonna take my existing plugs that are
gonna<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.140> downsizing<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.030> one

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
gonna be downsizing and take this one

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
gonna be downsizing and take this one
out<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:47.270> this<00:00:48.270> one's<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.840> screw<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
out so this one's just a screw back so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.330 
out so this one's just a screw back so
just<00:00:49.710> screw<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.399> off<00:00:54.949> okay<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.280> I've

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just screw the back off okay so now I've

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
just screw the back off okay so now I've
taken<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.320> through

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
taken this one out you can see through

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.450 
taken this one out you can see through
the<00:00:58.949> hole<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> bigger<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the hole that one is bigger than the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
the hole that one is bigger than the
bottom<00:01:02.579> hole<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.379> why<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.680> gonna

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
bottom hole so you can see why I'm gonna

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.910 
bottom hole so you can see why I'm gonna
be<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.189> changing<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> sizes<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
be like changing the sizes over so it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.170 
be like changing the sizes over so it
will<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.100> better<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.520> having<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> smaller

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
will be better off having the smaller

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
will be better off having the smaller
size<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> top<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> bigger<00:01:10.470> size

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
size at the top and then a bigger size

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
size at the top and then a bigger size
at<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> bottom<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> wanted<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> do

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
at the bottom see what I wanted to do

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.600 
at the bottom see what I wanted to do
first<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.350> gauge<00:01:13.650> gear<00:01:14.040> stretching

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
first is take my gauge gear stretching

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
first is take my gauge gear stretching
bands<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> link<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> description

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
bands I put the link in the description

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.330 
bands I put the link in the description
box<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.509> also<00:01:19.020> perhaps<00:01:19.200> helps<00:01:19.710> promote

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
box and this also perhaps helps promote

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.590 
box and this also perhaps helps promote
healing<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:22.020> skin<00:01:22.820> not<00:01:23.820> drying<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.360> as

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
healing and the skin not drying out as

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200 
healing and the skin not drying out as
much<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.340> stretching<00:01:26.729> balm<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
much so take your stretching balm and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
much so take your stretching balm and
put<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> ear<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.799> back<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
put it on the ear and the back of the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
put it on the ear and the back of the
ear<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> hole<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
ear if you can get it in the hole it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
ear if you can get it in the hole it
depends<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.280> trickier<00:01:32.610> stretch<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> be

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
depends how much trickier stretch to be

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.399 
depends how much trickier stretch to be
honest<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.320> fine<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.290> gonna

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
honest then that's all fine so I'm gonna

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.760 
honest then that's all fine so I'm gonna
take<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:37.710> silicon<00:01:38.579> tunnel<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:40.560> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
take my silicon tunnel and I'm just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.330 
take my silicon tunnel and I'm just
gonna<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> hole<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:44.220> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
gonna put this in the hole and there we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.749 
gonna put this in the hole and there we
go

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
go

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.560 
go
so<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:46.979> hold<00:01:47.369> itself<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.360> because

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so it will hold itself in there because

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.319 
so it will hold itself in there because
of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> silicon<00:01:49.409> bits<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.090> pull<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
of the silicon bits and if I pull it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.920 
of the silicon bits and if I pull it
down<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.759> there<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.970> quite<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.600> big

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
down you can see there is quite a big

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
down you can see there is quite a big
size<00:01:55.259> difference<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:56.149> I'm<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.270> wait<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
size difference there I'm gonna wait a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
size difference there I'm gonna wait a
couple<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.840> days<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> lobes<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> shrink

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
couple of days for the lobes to shrink

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.060 
couple of days for the lobes to shrink
down<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> 6<00:02:00.240> gauge<00:02:00.600> size<00:02:01.110> fit<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.829> there
