00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.700
 hello I am I mission and again and today 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.700
 I will teach you how to do 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:22.060
 whites I think we need that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.950
 believe that my blue mouth good they gave me 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.960
 want to remember that I am a being 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.279
 indefinite ha ha 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.849
 good good, let's go back, we need a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.849
 cup of rice 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.470
 a small box with a spoonful of nor 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.650
 Swiss or chicken powder soup 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.900
 a pretty big garlic 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.140
 a piece of onion I'm not going to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 put whole just a bit 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.420
 we need twice the amount of 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.140
 rice in the water then here we have 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 this glass a pinch of grain salt that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:06.080
 it's my favorite and a trickle of poison 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.080
 Now what follows is the following 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.820
 he starts to rinse the rice 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.119
 under the stream of water until it leaves 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.920
 of leaving the white water then the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.960
 we do this until it does not go out to the water 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.680
 clarita 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.020
 Now let's put the oil to heat 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.119
 let it be a trickle 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 and since it is hot we are going to add 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.240
 the rice 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.580
 previously we could put to drain 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.390
 the water so that we do not miss much 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.390
 Now let's add the rice 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 okay since it's like this we're going to be 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.509
 watching it until it takes an amber color 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.360
 so so 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.030
 and here we are 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.140
 we have to be steak with the white 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.159
 ok then while the rice is cooling 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.280
 we are going to add in the blender either 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:23.050
 a cube or spoon of non-Swiss that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.100
 It is being chicken powder 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.740
 let's add the here is very subtle ok 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.920
 let's add our immense tooth 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.920
 of garlic 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.530
 we have garlic a pinch of grain salt 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:52.470
 these things take more or less ok 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 good that you consider a little more 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.129
 I also 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.129
 and we are going to add the water 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 and we 're going to liquefy it 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.180
 what's going to happen with this good mix 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.459
 Well, once our roi is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.519
 amber color that we want we are going to add 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.819
 is this mixture so that we do not leave 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.819
 to burn and from the season ok let's see 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.069
 and we just wait for the right moment to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.810
 add 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.880
 Signs 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.880
 and it does not have to be this color 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.000
 very well so we have to stay 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
 this is the color to achieve 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.930
 the amber color 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.710
 now let's put what we did in the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.420
 blender but remove headquarters from the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.920
 casserole because steam comes out a lot 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.510
 now let's believe it 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 subtly subtle 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.540
 and add a little more water 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.320
 what I do is put 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.720
 in the other cup we throw two glasses of 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.500
 good water twice more times four times 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.419
 the amount of a cup of rice and 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.039
 yandel a lot here in the blender for 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:36.740
 that you reach to carry everything that we 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:36.740
 We left over everyone's garlic and added it 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.680
 and finally we are going to put a piece of 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.680
 onion 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.120
 even so 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.580
 but and we're going to cover it and we're going to 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.580
 leave like this for about half an hour 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:03.160
 and we already pay you until it evaporates 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.160
 all this water we leave it at medium heat 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.230
 then he gave me 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.889
 and is not uncovering it please because 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:15.210
 that kind of spoils cooking a little 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:18.210
 and then almost everything is already and now 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.650
 He taught them already finished or if I and I 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.819
 I sisi subscribe subscribe sisi bueno 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.819
 Now he taught them 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:33.879
 and here it is finally 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:37.689
 finally the super-fluffy white rice 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:40.980
 and so very rich let's see how if 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:44.560
 I could not read what I'm reading 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.440
 and look just look just how tasty 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.530
 and you can already accompany it with some 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.200
 coriander twigs or they can put this 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.870

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.560
