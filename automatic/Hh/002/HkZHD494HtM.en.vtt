cause<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.909> uh<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> lot

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
cause but uh i think it's a lot

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
cause but uh i think it's a lot
different<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.150> playing<00:01:18.540> style
