do<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.320> from<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.530> incline<00:04:00.950> bench<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:02.090> can

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
do it from the incline bench and you can

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.020 
do it from the incline bench and you can
also<00:04:02.390> use<00:04:02.780> cables<00:04:03.470> from<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.740> top<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.790> middle

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
also use cables from the top the middle

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.490 
also use cables from the top the middle
and<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.990> bottom

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
and the bottom

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.450 
and the bottom
so<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.270> what<00:04:08.660> I<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.320> get<00:04:09.890> my<00:04:09.950> chest

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
if I do that move you can see that cross

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.130 
if I do that move you can see that cross
striation<00:04:16.730> coming<00:04:17.060> from<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.390> middle<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:18.109> the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
striation coming from the middle to the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.560 
striation coming from the middle to the
outside<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.730> other<00:04:19.760> side<00:04:20.210> you<00:04:20.390> guys

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
