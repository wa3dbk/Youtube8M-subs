00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.760

 dome were saying that the morning show 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.420
 the fantasy came but not only 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.220
 to show you this place really 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 incredible but to tell stories 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.660
 amazing groups of young people who 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 they are here that are only the lives that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 they are the lifeguards that are really 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.169
 those who take care of our lives and those who 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 they were protagonists when the flood 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.390
 of days ago surprised several 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.220
 bathers here in this area in slope 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.630
 white and in areas that there are always 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 to be careful, we have to talk 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 we can talk about caution and what 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.190
 they have to take into account the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 tourists when it comes to getting into the river 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 but this when the protagonists do not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 they actually see one of the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 representatives of this beautiful group of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 young people who take care of us when 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.470

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.690
 9 'growing venezuela and my partner 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.580

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.530
 quickly and we rescued from the site more 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.720
 firefighters rescue people who 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.160
 They also knew we act quickly 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.750
 we are now watching guys in the water 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.820

 makes red with his good brother 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.970
 family this is to save and I see 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.000
 why do you take there to passion that 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830
 several seasons is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690
 around this season like this 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.550
 second season as a lifeguard that 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.140
 happened when you take the people out of the water 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.700
 I imagine that as we say the colors 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.680
 and blood of covenants because here what 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.690
 our fast and depended on the life of 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.970
 Many people that you are your life with 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.130
 cold head I do not know success the whole 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.510
 that another was two minutes so I 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.690
 I was labeled yes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.970
 according to 2002 invited to the task and good 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.980
 reaction at a good time was when 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.780
 I started with rescue of him is that it was what 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.429
 fundamental 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440
 we could be lamenting victims of 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.300
 those kids later to walk people more 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.310
 great and good I stayed with the last 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.080
 two people who can rescue those who 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.450
 they are back by a stone when 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.819
 growing 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 after not when you came out and you 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.680
 You sat on the bank of the river, good in your 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.380
 put and breathe this deep to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 see emotions that touched me is that it came 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.800
 walking from the west dock that 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.500
 Firefighters had already left me and if 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
 been whole will be antonio of that the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.520

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.400
 applauding 6,000 thanks for these 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.209
 things is the case a boy like 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.680
 call the name and it was making me money 3 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.080
 origin that I did not accept that was was my 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 work and the same month to the west the life 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.709
 be now I would be counting obviously 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.420
 that I do not put is to review is this request 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.769
 not the one that you have as soon as 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.780
 some elements not that they need 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.420
 yes good it costs white that an area 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.830
 quite complicated because we have 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.300
 parts that are quite deep and very 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.790
 dangerous to the body of guard 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.159
 get us there to the rescue
