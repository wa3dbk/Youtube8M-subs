you<00:00:59.780> right<00:00:59.810> away<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.560> learning<00:01:00.950> curve<00:01:01.130> for

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
you right away the learning curve for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.070 
you right away the learning curve for
this<00:01:01.430> car<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.760> extremely<00:01:02.480> steep<00:01:02.720> there's<00:01:03.020> a

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
this car is extremely steep there's a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.079 
this car is extremely steep there's a
lot<00:01:03.350> going<00:01:03.680> on<00:01:03.770> with<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.040> dashboard<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.699> you

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
lot going on with the dashboard and you

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.510 
lot going on with the dashboard and you
could<00:01:05.300> spend<00:01:05.560> easily<00:01:06.560> two<00:01:07.040> weeks<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.490> month

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
trying to figure everything out I think

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
get inside now of course there's always

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.410 
get inside now of course there's always

the traditional Viper vs. Corvette

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.539 
the traditional Viper vs. Corvette
rivalry<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.440> Viper<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.890> really<00:03:21.160> almost<00:03:21.340> a

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
rivalry but the Viper is really almost a

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.789 
rivalry but the Viper is really almost a
cartoon<00:03:22.030> compared<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.750> car<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.200> believe

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
cartoon compared to this car I believe

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.289 
cartoon compared to this car I believe
that<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> Corvette<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.820> much<00:03:25.090> more

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
that the Corvette is a much more

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.750 
that the Corvette is a much more
versatile<00:03:25.870> everyday<00:03:26.680> kind<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.040> car<00:03:27.190> not<00:03:27.430> there

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
versatile everyday kind of car not there

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.800 
versatile everyday kind of car not there
are<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.910> lot<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> people<00:03:28.269> who<00:03:28.450> are<00:03:28.540> going<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.690> be

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
are a lot of people who are going to be

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.070 
are a lot of people who are going to be
using<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.350> way

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.510 

now<00:03:35.080> obviously<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.620> think<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.920> car<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.280> hit

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
now obviously I think the car is a hit

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.760 
now obviously I think the car is a hit
but<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.240> ask<00:03:37.390> myself<00:03:37.630> how<00:03:38.260> well<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.650> all

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
but I have to ask myself how well is all

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.350 
but I have to ask myself how well is all
that<00:03:38.950> complexity<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.640> dashboard<00:03:40.120> going

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
that complexity on the dashboard going

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.110 
that complexity on the dashboard going
to<00:03:40.450> age<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.990> I<00:03:41.470> also<00:03:41.620> wonder<00:03:42.130> with<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> zo6<00:03:42.910> on

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
to age and I also wonder with a zo6 on

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.150 
to age and I also wonder with a zo6 on
the<00:03:43.270> way<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.600> possibly<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.080> zr<00:03:44.500> one<00:03:44.710> version<00:03:45.040> as

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
the way and possibly a zr one version as

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.010 
the way and possibly a zr one version as
well<00:03:45.190> how<00:03:45.880> much<00:03:46.030> more<00:03:46.270> performance<00:03:46.780> can<00:03:46.930> you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
well how much more performance can you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.480 
well how much more performance can you
really<00:03:47.200> access<00:03:47.710> on<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> street

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
really access on the street

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.250 
really access on the street
not<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.910> whole<00:03:49.180> lot<00:03:49.210> those<00:03:49.600> are<00:03:49.720> gonna<00:03:49.810> be<00:03:49.900> track

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
not a whole lot those are gonna be track

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.200 
not a whole lot those are gonna be track
cars<00:03:50.560> what<00:03:51.310> i'd<00:03:51.430> really<00:03:51.460> like<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.850> see<00:03:52.000> is

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
cars what i'd really like to see is

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.510 
cars what i'd really like to see is
something<00:03:52.390> like<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> formula<00:03:53.350> stingray<00:03:53.770> decon

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
something like a formula stingray decon

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.210 
something like a formula stingray decon
tented<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.940> bit<00:03:55.120> more<00:03:55.870> simple<00:03:56.200> gauges<00:03:56.590> but<00:03:57.100> all

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
tented a bit more simple gauges but all
