of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> best<00:01:32.700> ways<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:34.020> opinion<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:35.030> expand

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
of the best ways in my opinion to expand

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.280 
of the best ways in my opinion to expand
the<00:01:36.150> life<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> emulators<00:01:36.900> make<00:01:37.140> them

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the life of the emulators make them

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
the life of the emulators make them
actually<00:01:37.890> makes<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> lot<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> ways

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
actually makes them in a lot of ways

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.770 
actually makes them in a lot of ways
better<00:01:39.750> than<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.770> standard<00:01:41.189> system<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.600> let's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
better than the standard system so let's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.819 
better than the standard system so let's
go<00:01:42.930> ahead<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> open<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.670> actual<00:01:45.680> game<00:01:46.680> boy

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
go ahead and open a an actual game boy

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.780 
go ahead and open a an actual game boy
advance<00:01:47.520> rum<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.979> case<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.670> should

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
advance rum in this case I should

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.160 
advance rum in this case I should
probably<00:01:51.270> pick<00:01:51.420> something<00:01:51.810> simple<00:01:52.579> so

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170

Nintendo<00:02:43.010> hardware<00:02:43.750> because<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.870> was

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
Nintendo hardware because it was

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.680 
Nintendo hardware because it was
developed<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.440> much<00:02:45.590> later<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.510> even<00:02:47.510> though

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
developed so much later and even though

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.660 
developed so much later and even though
its<00:02:47.930> graphics<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:48.980> may<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.220> comparable

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
everything else are just so much

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.460
