impose<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:54.160> stem<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:54.850> helped<00:01:55.150> me<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.300> to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
impose the stem really helped me to to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.020 
impose the stem really helped me to to
control<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.710> design<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:57.370> I<00:01:57.400> can<00:01:57.640> really<00:01:57.820> have

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
control the design so I can really have

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
with it yeah now this this is another

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.390 
with it yeah now this this is another
touring<00:02:38.450> style<00:02:38.720> by<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.930> very<00:02:39.410> similar<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:40.010> idea

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
touring style by is very similar in idea

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.210 
touring style by is very similar in idea
and<00:02:40.550> usage<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.450> only<00:02:42.230> difference<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> male

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and usage the only difference is a male

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.479 
and usage the only difference is a male
rider<00:02:44.290> who<00:02:45.290> wants<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.069> where<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
rider who wants to have all where the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.729 
rider who wants to have all where the
abilities<00:02:46.970> that's<00:02:47.269> why<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.480> disc<00:02:47.810> brakes<00:02:48.080> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
abilities that's why the disc brakes and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.380 
abilities that's why the disc brakes and
personally<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.519> really<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.849> disparate

personally I really like disparate

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.509 
personally I really like disparate
systems<00:02:50.540> even<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.380> for<00:02:51.769> road<00:02:51.950> going<00:02:52.160> bikes

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
systems even for for road going bikes

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.039 
systems even for for road going bikes
sure<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.599> don't<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.900> to

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
sure because you just don't have to

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.009 
sure because you just don't have to
worry<00:02:54.260> about<00:02:54.319> wearing<00:02:55.160> out<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.430> whim<00:02:56.019> you

don't have to worry about moisture
having<00:02:59.269> problem<00:02:59.569> stopping<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.079> bike<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.620> can

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
having problem stopping the bike you can

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.710 
having problem stopping the bike you can
pack<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.160> lot<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.400> weight<00:03:01.610> that's<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.690> a

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
pack on a lot of weight that's on a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.150 
pack on a lot of weight that's on a
little<00:03:02.989> bit<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.200> weight<00:03:03.349> but<00:03:03.380> then<00:03:03.709> yeah<00:03:03.980> you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
little bit of weight but then yeah you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.979 
little bit of weight but then yeah you
can<00:03:04.190> really<00:03:04.519> slow<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> down<00:03:04.970> right<00:03:05.360> well<00:03:05.720> and

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
can really slow it down right well and

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.979 
can really slow it down right well and
in<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.099> case<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.700> lot<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.239> mail<00:03:08.450> riders<00:03:08.660> they

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
in this case a lot of mail riders they

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.920 
in this case a lot of mail riders they
only<00:03:09.440> really<00:03:09.980> use<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> rear<00:03:10.579> shifting<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.750> we

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
only really use the rear shifting so we

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.839 
only really use the rear shifting so we
are<00:03:12.049> put<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.349> front<00:03:12.530> shifter<00:03:12.980> here<00:03:13.280> yeah<00:03:13.610> like

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
are put the front shifter here yeah like

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.940 
are put the front shifter here yeah like
just<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.239> minimize<00:03:14.810> all<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.470> clutter<00:03:15.709> up

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
just to minimize all the clutter up

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.949 
just to minimize all the clutter up
cables<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.610> guns<00:03:16.849> I<00:03:17.090> like<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.720> side

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
cables and guns I like that and a side

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.720 
cables and guns I like that and a side

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
benefit is when you do take apart the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.780 
benefit is when you do take apart the

bike for travel this is always ready you
just<00:03:23.060> put<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> bike<00:03:23.780> back<00:03:23.989> together<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.709> it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
just put the bike back together and it's

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.030 
just put the bike back together and it's
functional<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.090> no<00:03:26.299> extra<00:03:26.600> cable<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.530> adjust

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
again you're using the stainless opposed

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.629 
again you're using the stainless opposed
ecosystem<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.200> by<00:03:36.530> only<00:03:36.859> have<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.160> fun<00:03:37.400> bag

this<00:04:01.910> Romano<00:04:02.269> di2<00:04:02.630> system

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
this Romano di2 system

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.920 
this Romano di2 system
yeah<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.239> interesting<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
yeah I think what is interesting is that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.229 
yeah I think what is interesting is that
the<00:04:07.260> frame<00:04:07.560> helped<00:04:07.890> us<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.670> really<00:04:08.819> put<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the frame helped us to really put the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.910 
the frame helped us to really put the
rider<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:09.690> right<00:04:09.870> position<00:04:10.349> haha<00:04:10.650> but

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
rider in the right position haha but

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.920 
rider in the right position haha but
then<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.580> game<00:04:11.790> being<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.360> one<00:04:12.569> is<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> female

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
then a game being this one is a female

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.770 
then a game being this one is a female

in<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.229> case<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.650> just<00:04:28.680> can't<00:04:29.040> be<00:04:29.250> with<00:04:29.280> so

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
in this case we just can't be with so

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.390 
in this case we just can't be with so
that<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.660> more<00:04:30.900> clear<00:04:31.169> here<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.250> run

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
that it's more clear here just to run

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.250 
that it's more clear here just to run
the<00:04:32.550> cable<00:04:32.880> down<00:04:33.060> below<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.900> was<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.199> mean

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
the cable down below so this was I mean

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.110 
the cable down below so this was I mean
this<00:04:34.530> was<00:04:34.740> designed<00:04:34.949> because<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:35.790> can<00:04:35.940> see

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
this was designed because I can see

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.460 
this was designed because I can see
you've<00:04:36.270> got<00:04:36.389> these<00:04:36.540> brace<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.320> was

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
you've got these brace on this was

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.580 
you've got these brace on this was
designed<00:04:37.680> for<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:39.000> electric<00:04:39.540> ship<00:04:39.780> with<00:04:40.440> that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
designed for the electric ship with that

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.650 
designed for the electric ship with that
in<00:04:40.770> mind<00:04:40.950> yeah<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.940> that's<00:04:42.060> one<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.510> key

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
in mind yeah and that's one of the key

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.600 
in mind yeah and that's one of the key
thing<00:04:42.870> when<00:04:42.960> we<00:04:43.080> build<00:04:43.290> by<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.830> need<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.460> know

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
thing when we build by we need to know

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.040 
thing when we build by we need to know
okay<00:04:44.910> what<00:04:45.180> kind<00:04:45.450> of<00:04:45.479> stuff<00:04:45.690> are<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.840> gonna

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
okay what kind of stuff are you gonna

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.030 
okay what kind of stuff are you gonna
run<00:04:46.760> shifting<00:04:47.760> wise<00:04:47.940> or<00:04:48.360> wheels<00:04:49.040> braking

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
run shifting wise or wheels braking

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.190 
run shifting wise or wheels braking
system<00:04:50.490> yeah<00:04:50.820> we<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.120> really<00:04:51.419> consider<00:04:51.840> it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
system yeah we can really consider it

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.610 
system yeah we can really consider it
into<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.560> design<00:04:52.860> yeah<00:04:53.310> yeah<00:04:53.729> now<00:04:54.600> how<00:04:54.750> how

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
into the design yeah yeah now how how

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.950 
into the design yeah yeah now how how
