00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 picasso guys all the laces of 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.100
 been if you are in stands we were at the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.200
 Monday and we are up to date with tutorials and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.910
 today's cultural is quite simple is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 easy to do for everyone is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.990
 complex as it puts other tutorials 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 this is going to be quite simple and it's going to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.000
 try to make a flower farm that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.740
 be two tall flowers worth 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 unlimited there pum pum pum pum a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.519
 automatic farm that works with a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.760
 lever so it's great so no 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.120
 let's go let's start 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.250
 well basically we're going to be able to 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.700
 use on the farm as these four 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.920
 types of flower plants are worth a 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.150
 palanquita we would give it and now to 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 manufacture 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.400
 ok you see in a moment 30 here equal 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 come to party this what it is for 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.460
 for dyes for example the rope or 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.399
 be 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.170
 it really works is perfect this is 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.329
 recommendable to have in any map of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.380
 his providence or whatever because I can 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.480
 look 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.820
 one more tutorial of not so many in order to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.910
 bills 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.400
 as you see a lot these four types 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.550
 what would happen to the other two types of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.650
 two of height that would be east and east 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.140
 well let's remove for suddenly it 's 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.270
 and we will put it if we give it 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 nothing will jump 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.120
 and in the other 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.120
 neither do we lack anything as you see 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.800
 so nothing until then good and good 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.440
 how is this done that we need 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.770
 show a good dispenser first all 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.350
 earth then a block totally run and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.470
 random how can the block be this 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.520
 of ice a drop er we are two scattered 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.490
 the program I do of rest 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.210
 a buyer and a lever we're just 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.180
 this what is being truthful 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.979
 the bull milk and we are going to take the plant 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.780
 totally random how can this be 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.940
 here it's worth with this we have everything done 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.470
 as it would be easy then we can 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.810
 where we are going to create is to place the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.509
 which is the plant just behind 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.730
 a block above is something that a 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.430
 dispenser and above audrey spencer two 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.700
 dispense well 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 on this side or in this symmetrical power 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.610
 it does not matter and I would take it this 1 2 and 3 is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.560
 say next to the earth 1 2 and 3 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.920
 once put that right here at 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 side we put one of the rest 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 and here a buyer which 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.220
 we turn on there are lit left 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.290
 we walk here where he stayed 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.430
 on - one block and on top of another 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.189
 block and here two is worth it if there were not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.110
 something for living you see again 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.060
 now in those two we put one and two of the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.470
 rest so it stays like this 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.460
 for those two above the rest 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.880
 we put one and two to see 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.830
 there it is and 23 we put on top of those two 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.860
 remains remains and we lower it 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 perfect and we owe our clock made 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.310
 now I say it would be to put 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.040
 a block here with the lever every time 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.100
 that you turn on will start to work and what 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.540
 we pay you see it's easy it's a rebound of 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.940
 very very simple comparator indeed 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.560
 many other videos and well what 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.420
 we will decorate as we would like 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.420
 for this I usually do this always 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.510
 it's very easy to do is the tutorial very 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.980
 simple and good you know that now 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.840
 we start again with every Monday 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.840
 a tutorial that I have a lot that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 Also easy to use and three of 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.159
 all 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.909
 we do not know what is up to the height for 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.909
 cover what has been 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.080
 and good in the event that you feel like it or 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.950
 it seems a little more beautiful to you because nothing 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 we put here this 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.050
 so that it is a bit more decorative 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.050
 OK 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.500
 and it 's playing around here and then 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.709
 example what is being here 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.190
 we could put 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.019
 to see is an example 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.260
 they are fox ideas that are going away 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.260
 happening 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.020
 and ready and now in here 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.289
 we would start to put the 1000 bus 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.889
 quietly is the dust of bones to 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.889
 end of accounts 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.729
 I'm multiplying with 64 days 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.979
 where with the mouse wheel that always 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.810
 you ask me now we will have to do 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.530
 is to put the plant 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 and ready 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.480
 for those who do not know we want 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.220
 back to the plant we will be giving 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.810
 that what we have done is put two 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.850
 waivers to be automatic to 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.840
 starting from a clock has no more mystery 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.840
 and it's pretty simple 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.009
 we stopped her now a couple of these because 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.720
 yes 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.389

 find other series and other games 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.940

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.560
 your world where you want with your 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.640
 friends or sell the flowers then by 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.530
 example you have to separate what you can 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.600
 to do is do this in your home and 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.480
 then sell the flowers to people about 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.930
 buy flowers for your dyes in 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.150
 servers for example is an idea 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.470
