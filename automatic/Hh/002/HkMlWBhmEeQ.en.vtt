00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.469
 hello how about for these national holidays 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.150
 Let's weave earrings have it 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.490
 the three colors of our flag of 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.590
 mexico to need good in this case I 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.640
 I'm going to use some rings that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.490
 they come in milk cans 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.369
 two of them and the two milestone brooches 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 for the earrings let's start here 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 well I will start using the color 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.430
 red I'll start by passing the thread through 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.430
 the stamen through the hole 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.000
 of the brooch 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.690
 here I will spend it having it more or 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.589
 less this amount look at yarn has already 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 gone through here and I'm going to put my hook 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.059
 in the bottom 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 turning to load chito in the part 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.850
 from below I pass my hook over here it took 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.240
 a loop and I'm going to have a chain here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 from here on this chain is that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 I'm going to start the fabric on 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 ring the ring of preference that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.140
 are the teeth turning towards the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.050
 left side for as we go 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 weaving is not getting in the way of 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.170
 tooth from here I will start 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 I take the thread to hide it 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 as I knit, I will spend my 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.790
 hook for the middle part and here I go 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.990
 to knit 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.990
 half points 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.869
 I'm going to knit the amount of 12 here 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.869
 half points here I have already 1 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.320
 2 is like that 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.650
 here is going to be accommodating 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.880
 4 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.540
 5 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.730
 I already have the 12 midpoints here 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.940
 tissues 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 and here I am going to weave a very 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.560
 reinforced 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.620
 to cut the thread of preference 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.080
 leave it about 2 or 3 centimeters long 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.440
 because as we go weaving the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.920
 next color let's go hiding it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.930
 I started with the red thread now 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.400
 I continue with the white thread 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.400
 and then this hunger 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.030
 and here I'm going to do two very 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.850
 reinforced 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.950
 to start my tissue 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.500
 and I will continue in the part here 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.030
 I'm going to hide these two strands 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.740
 as I go weaving then here 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.880
 Start 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.140
 the half points that I need to knit 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.320
 here is one I will also contain 12 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.920
 there will be twelve half points of each 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.920
 colour 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.800
 and here in the matter it is to go hiding 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.540
 the zebras 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.540
 as we go weaving 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.380
 here I already have the 12 half points left 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.890
 a very reinforced chain and again 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.050
 cut shit 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.530
 here I'm going to knit I'm hiding 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.920
 but if the strand of the red color comes out very 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.070
 here I can cut it because here already 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.080
 is gone through all these points here 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.080
 nothing happens if we remove it 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.510
 now let's take our green color 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.890
 and again we start 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.890
 with two chains 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.120
 this was the green color that I found like this 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.880
 which is what I'm knitting 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.160
 here we already have the point mounted on 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.160
 the hook and now we start here 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.310
 to weave our first half point 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.310
 A) Yes 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.590
 and we keep hiding the threads 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.539
 two 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.900
 and so on until completing 12 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.450
 4 good look and I finished the 12 media 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.470
 points now what we are going to do here 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:04.490
 is to join the tissues in the first point 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.410
 where the red color came out here I'm going to 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.560
 put the hook I'll knit a stitch 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:14.390
 slipped this is to close here and the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.050
 turn left a very reinforced chain 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.560
 short fear 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.900
 and for example here that this white came out 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.289
 to pull makes these two come together 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.629
 tones then here I 'm not going to 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.630
 Hide more with this points tour 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.870
 It's enough 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:38.070
 then here the only thing that remains is 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.129
 hide the strand in green is the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.229
 we can hide 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:47.439
 passing it through the points for about 3 or 4 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.439
 points 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.340
 I already spent there for some points nothing 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.340
 more adjusted here 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.030
 and what is left 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.979
 here I took him is how was this art 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.789
 just like we told you this let's knit 

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.789
 the second earring 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.250
 thank you for being here that are very 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.250
 well until the next
