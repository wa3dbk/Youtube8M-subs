00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
like that and then put signs exactly

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:17.420 
like that and then put signs exactly
what<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.709> you're<00:03:16.829> going<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.069> three

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
or this one but just need signs here and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.349 
or this one but just need signs here and
then<00:03:48.989> you'll<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.290> signs<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.920> too<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:57.209> know

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
then you'll have signs here too you know

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.479 
then you'll have signs here too you know
what<00:03:57.569> you're<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.930> want<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.079> do<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:59.010> place

what you're going to want to do is place
lava<00:03:59.879> on<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.299> last<00:04:00.870> call<00:04:01.230> stone<00:04:01.560> block<00:04:01.859> back

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
lava on the last call stone block back

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:11.089 
lava on the last call stone block back
there<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:10.079> mobs<00:04:10.319> are<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> come<00:04:10.950> in

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
there and the mobs are going to come in

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.949 
there and the mobs are going to come in
swimming<00:04:11.700> because<00:04:12.329> they're<00:04:12.629> swimming

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
swimming because they're swimming

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
they're jumping up and down and then

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.670 
they're jumping up and down and then
we'll<00:04:15.239> start<00:04:15.450> swimming<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.139> lava<00:04:16.349> and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
we'll start swimming in the lava and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.960 
we'll start swimming in the lava and
their<00:04:16.799> drops<00:04:17.070> will<00:04:17.310> fall<00:04:17.519> down<00:04:17.549> here<00:04:19.459> okay<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
dig out the ceiling you probably should

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.010 
dig out the ceiling you probably should
and<00:04:34.070> yeah<00:04:35.070> get<00:04:35.580> rid<00:04:35.759> of<00:04:35.789> the<00:04:36.000> last<00:04:36.240> signs<00:04:36.630> by

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
the important glass so you could see

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.140 
the important glass so you could see
what's<00:04:40.800> going<00:04:41.099> on<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:44.550> can<00:04:44.729> make<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.120> a

could be your house or you could make a
ladder<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.169> surface<00:04:52.699> and<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:56.699> moms<00:04:57.570> drops

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
ladder to the surface and the moms drops

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.920 
ladder to the surface and the moms drops
will<00:04:58.470> just<00:04:58.710> come<00:04:58.979> through<00:04:59.389> here<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.510> you'll

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
will just come through here and you'll

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.050 
will just come through here and you'll

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.060 

if<00:05:23.180> you're<00:05:23.390> on<00:05:23.450> creative<00:05:24.050> mode<00:05:24.320> be<00:05:24.650> careful

if you're on creative mode be careful
that<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.340> don't<00:05:25.430> destroy<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.000> spawner<00:05:32.530> see

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
that you don't destroy the spawner see

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
them to start spawning you have to stand

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.149 
them to start spawning you have to stand
right<00:06:55.389> at<00:06:55.719> the<00:06:55.840> edge<00:06:55.990> of<00:06:56.169> the<00:06:56.319> glass<00:06:56.500> because

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
right at the edge of the glass because

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.700 
right at the edge of the glass because
this<00:06:58.060> is<00:06:58.300> the<00:06:58.539> minimum<00:06:58.960> length<00:06:59.229> the<00:06:59.500> way<00:06:59.650> you

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
this is the minimum length the way you

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.029 
this is the minimum length the way you
have<00:06:59.949> to<00:07:00.099> be<00:07:00.280> for<00:07:00.520> this<00:07:00.639> fauna<00:07:01.000> to<00:07:01.270> turn<00:07:01.599> on<00:07:02.039> and

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
have to be for this fauna to turn on and
