00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 Riga sambou Kambakhsh wool and had shourd 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.040
 and boot reads 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.570
 and then personal times in the cebit here 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.369
 time making another video and gta is like this 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.660
 with online for you good people today 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.390
 In this video I want to talk about the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.739
 stop maybe there maybe already 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.380
 I thought if I want to go, put this on the 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.690
 game about stop buying cause of 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.820
 police in gt1 imagine how crazy you 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.890
 get there in your apartment in the garage 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.050
 that the police car is there 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.879
 I forgot the name, how do you say it in the end? 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.309
 such a police car in your garage to 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.500
 Who does not know who to play online for? 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.110
 at least I played since when it launched 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.489
 released the online mode of gta played and 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.800
 Old man already in the beginning we had tickets 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.049
 now that you got one up to level 3 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.760
 of wanted then you leave me 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.770
 I need to kill and I could save the car. 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.090
 police in the garage had customers 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.070
 So what you got is getting 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.380
 cause of police guard in the garage but 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.909
 so accused ended up correcting it eventually 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.159
 involving these garage cars from the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.990
 The people who made this glitch 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.760
 so it was never allowed to put 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.470
 these types of vehicles in car garage 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.510
 police to gmail jensen 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.720
 these utility cars and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.359
 emergency service cars never 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.090
 were allowed to save in gt1 and I did not 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.920
 I see problem if I had the truth 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 I think they do it to leave 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.759
 because the gta they want to leave with more 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.920
 is the possible in itself is not the reality 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.729
 you have a police car in your 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.710
 garage 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.420
 but I think in online gta at least 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.700
 they could be releasing then 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 gringo made this assembly there that you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.289
 you see he has created a website that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 simulated there the shopping site has a website 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.999
 buying supercars 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.759
 such exercises so he simulated the site 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.740
 cause and police purchases with you 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.920
 Are you seeing in first you have this one? 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.170
 class f aib that costs 55 thousand 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.759
 I think this case is enough to save 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.649
 if I'm not mistaken I'm not sure I 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.330
 I know you have a similar model of him that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.550
 It's original, it was not police. It's nothing. 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.590
 and there is another there that is the buffalo that is the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.870
 funk case in the local module of the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.850
 police and also has a normal buffalo 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.319
 He that I think has at last several 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.540
 Daniel models have that model there 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.790
 also that it is the sheriff who 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.220
 near the house of the trailer's work 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.050
 of the old morale trap was 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 that the credits of this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.700
 gringo is in the description actually going 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.340
 being two gringos that is is one that made the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.020
 stop the site and another that created something 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.760
 some more cause types so 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.530
 if they really work that way 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.210
 site could also add to these 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.920
 types of causes this kind of 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.410
 customization for all cars like 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.510
 for example some damn cell phone chaos 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 so if someday guys would add 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.520
 these vehicles there a site there to power 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.170
 have acquired police cause in gt online 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.270
 it would also be good to work on 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.000
 new types of customization the new 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.010
 saints imagine you get your t20 your 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.860
 environment and then place the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.820
 police at the end of the lighthouse on top of the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.220
 car and such 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.770
 I would stay in saints the staff only think 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.390
 only that even if you have you know 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.460
 anything else about this has any 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.830
