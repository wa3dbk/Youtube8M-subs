00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
happening is you see I think there is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.319 
happening is you see I think there is
there<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.550> absolute<00:00:55.460> unity<00:00:56.460> between<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there is an absolute unity between the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.680 
there is an absolute unity between the
political<00:00:57.870> state<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.949> Europe<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.690> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
his time I know that as well but the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
his time I know that as well but the
referee<00:04:13.500> was<00:04:13.829> British<00:04:14.220> wasn't<00:04:14.519> he<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.879> he's

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
referee was British wasn't he and he's

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.770 
referee was British wasn't he and he's
been<00:04:15.299> subjugated<00:04:15.660> by<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.440> know<00:04:17.780> continental

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
been subjugated by you know continental

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.930 
been subjugated by you know continental
European<00:04:19.199> rules<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.889> what<00:04:20.039> I'm<00:04:20.130> saying<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.639> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
European rules so what I'm saying is the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.420 
European rules so what I'm saying is the
idea<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.479> right<00:04:21.719> let's<00:04:22.289> design<00:04:22.710> football<00:04:23.250> for

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
idea is right let's design football for

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.310 
idea is right let's design football for
the<00:04:23.520> weakest<00:04:23.909> so<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.630> weakest<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.050> those<00:04:25.200> who

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
the weakest so the weakest of those who

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.050 
the weakest so the weakest of those who
can't<00:04:25.560> tackle<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.250> weakest<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.760> those<00:04:26.909> who

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
can't tackle the weakest of those who

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.379 
can't tackle the weakest of those who
don't<00:04:27.150> have

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
don't have

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.179 
don't have
the<00:04:27.479> metal<00:04:27.810> or<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.050> bottle<00:04:28.349> to<00:04:28.650> want<00:04:28.949> to

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
the metal or the bottle to want to

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.279 
the metal or the bottle to want to
tackle<00:04:29.430> right<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.150> weakest<00:04:30.659> are<00:04:30.870> those<00:04:31.050> who

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
tackle right the weakest are those who

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.869 
tackle right the weakest are those who
would<00:04:31.379> prefer<00:04:31.439> note<00:04:32.009> acting<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.639> in<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
would prefer note acting to be in the

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.580 
would prefer note acting to be in the
game<00:04:33.090> because<00:04:33.629> it<00:04:33.780> makes<00:04:33.990> life<00:04:34.199> easier<00:04:34.349> for

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
game because it makes life easier for

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.350 
game because it makes life easier for
them<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.400> understand<00:04:35.699> what<00:04:35.789> I'm<00:04:35.879> saying<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.300> do

them you understand what I'm saying I do

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.350 
them you understand what I'm saying I do
so<00:04:36.990> what<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:37.979> do<00:04:38.129> is<00:04:38.279> we<00:04:38.430> impose<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:39.060> weakness

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
so what we do is we impose that weakness

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.050 
so what we do is we impose that weakness
on<00:04:39.719> to<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.099> anglo-saxon<00:04:41.099> game<00:04:41.279> where<00:04:41.939> we

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
on to the the anglo-saxon game where we

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.269 
on to the the anglo-saxon game where we
excel<00:04:42.479> at<00:04:42.509> physical<00:04:42.960> combat<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.919> all<00:04:44.129> of<00:04:44.219> a

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:44.279 
excel at physical combat and all of a

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.610 
excel at physical combat and all of a
sudden<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.939> have<00:04:45.060> nullified<00:04:45.629> a<00:04:45.900> large<00:04:46.289> part

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
sudden you have nullified a large part

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.989 
sudden you have nullified a large part
of<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.949> British<00:04:47.189> threats<00:04:47.460> there's<00:04:47.669> something

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
historic yeah I used to get up to a

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.269 
historic yeah I used to get up to a
centre-forward<00:05:21.300> said<00:05:21.779> yeah<00:05:21.930> half<00:05:22.080> years<00:05:22.229> ago

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
centre-forward said yeah half years ago

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.610 
centre-forward said yeah half years ago
so<00:05:23.509> you<00:05:24.509> take<00:05:24.689> the<00:05:24.810> physical<00:05:25.139> contact<00:05:25.529> and

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
so you take the physical contact and

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.839 
so you take the physical contact and
here's<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.889> proof<00:05:26.039> of<00:05:26.189> the<00:05:26.279> pudding<00:05:26.310> is<00:05:26.669> the

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
here's the proof of the pudding is the

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.189 
here's the proof of the pudding is the
evidence<00:05:27.180> right<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:27.539> take<00:05:27.719> that<00:05:27.900> out<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> the

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
evidence right you take that out of the

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.749 
evidence right you take that out of the
game<00:05:28.379> what<00:05:28.680> happens<00:05:28.949> instead<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.639> us<00:05:29.729> having

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
game what happens instead of us having

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.029 
game what happens instead of us having
three<00:05:30.659> teams<00:05:30.960> in<00:05:31.319> the<00:05:31.409> semi<00:05:31.620> fans<00:05:31.860> of

final yeah
instead<00:05:37.319> of<00:05:37.409> having<00:05:37.500> one<00:05:37.800> English<00:05:38.310> team<00:05:38.580> in

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
instead of having one English team in

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.820 
instead of having one English team in
every<00:05:39.330> single<00:05:39.719> Champions<00:05:40.229> League<00:05:40.409> final<00:05:40.710> four
