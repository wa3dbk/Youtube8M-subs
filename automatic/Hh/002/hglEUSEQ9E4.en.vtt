then how you chose university was

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
then how you chose university was
constantly<00:01:58.680> why<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.860> children<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.790> meals<00:02:00.090> it

constantly why do children for meals it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
constantly why do children for meals it
was<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.619> different

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
was pretty it was a little different

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.289 
was pretty it was a little different
because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.219> ran<00:02:02.399> track<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.090> also

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
because I ran track so I was also

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.749 
because I ran track so I was also
getting<00:02:03.420> recruited<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.869> track<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:05.040> think

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
getting recruited for track and I think

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
getting recruited for track and I think
the<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.060> changed<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.659> me<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:07.049> going

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the thing that changed for me was going

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.139 
the thing that changed for me was going
to<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> nike<00:02:07.979> camera<00:02:08.369> onto<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> nike<00:02:08.849> camp

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to the nike camera onto the nike camp

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
to the nike camera onto the nike camp
that<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.539> out<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.750> USC<00:02:10.200> mm-hmm<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.009> got<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that was out in USC mm-hmm and I got a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.870 
that was out in USC mm-hmm and I got a
lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> exposure<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
lot of exposure from that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.970 
lot of exposure from that
and<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.540> was<00:02:13.840> able<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.200> offers<00:02:14.560> from<00:02:14.590> LSU

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and I was able to get offers from LSU

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.970 
and I was able to get offers from LSU
arkansas<00:02:15.460> South<00:02:16.180> Carolina<00:02:16.600> as<00:02:17.530> well<00:02:17.740> as<00:02:17.860> some

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
arkansas South Carolina as well as some

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.400 
arkansas South Carolina as well as some
other<00:02:18.040> big<00:02:18.310> 10<00:02:18.490> schools<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.540> was<00:02:20.260> real

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
other big 10 schools so that was real

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230 
other big 10 schools so that was real
crucial<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:20.920> me<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.400> chose<00:02:21.460> Wisconsin

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
crucial for me but I chose Wisconsin

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240 
crucial for me but I chose Wisconsin
because<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.780> mean<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> best<00:02:24.160> it's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
because I mean is it's the best it's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
because I mean is it's the best it's
tough<00:02:24.640> that's<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> only<00:02:25.480> school<00:02:25.690> really<00:02:25.930> in

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
tough that's the only school really in

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.330 
tough that's the only school really in
the<00:02:26.170> state<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.860> play<00:02:26.980> do<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.190> want

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the state you can play do you want

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
the state you can play do you want
football<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.390> feel<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> priority

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
football and I feel like a priority

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.290 
football and I feel like a priority
there<00:02:30.070> whereas<00:02:30.280> other<00:02:30.490> schools<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.880> felt<00:02:31.120> more

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
there whereas other schools I felt more

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
there whereas other schools I felt more
like<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.230> regular<00:02:32.410> recruit<00:02:32.830> that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
like I was just a regular recruit that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.650

you know was going to school there how

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.300 
you know was going to school there how
important<00:02:35.110> do<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.980> play

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
important do you think it is to play

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.620
