00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.910 
sets okay four sets of four propellers
and<00:00:58.970> then<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.720> also<00:00:59.930> get<00:01:00.199> an<00:01:00.350> extra<00:01:00.710> battery

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
and then you also get an extra battery

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.939 
and then you also get an extra battery
and<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:02.659> you<00:01:02.720> gotta<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.320> know<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.739> little

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
and so you gotta you know it's a little

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.500 
and so you gotta you know it's a little
bit<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.190> an<00:01:04.280> upgrade<00:01:04.430> there's<00:01:05.059> about<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.239> ten

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
bit of an upgrade there's about a ten

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.820 
bit of an upgrade there's about a ten
dollar<00:01:05.659> difference<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.440> think<00:01:06.650> it's<00:01:06.740> going

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
dollar difference but I think it's going

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.740 
dollar difference but I think it's going
around<00:01:07.010> thirty<00:01:07.490> seven<00:01:07.880> dollars<00:01:07.909> compared<00:01:08.630> to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
around thirty seven dollars compared to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.740 
around thirty seven dollars compared to
around<00:01:08.930> forty<00:01:09.770> seven<00:01:10.130> dollars<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:11.510> is

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
around forty seven dollars and this is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.469 
around forty seven dollars and this is
an<00:01:12.050> excellent<00:01:12.380> quad<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.070> learn<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.550> it's<00:01:14.150> so

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
an excellent quad to learn on it's so

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.890 
an excellent quad to learn on it's so
quiet<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:15.260> flies<00:01:16.210> aggressive<00:01:17.210> pretty

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
quiet it flies aggressive pretty

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.210 
quiet it flies aggressive pretty

aggressive I'll show you that here in
one<00:01:19.760> second<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.450> does<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> really<00:01:20.870> good<00:01:21.110> job

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
one second but it does a really good job

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.770

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
let's look at the transmitter this is

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.140 
let's look at the transmitter this is
not<00:01:27.110> really<00:01:27.290> new<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.530> holy<00:01:27.770> stones

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
not really new to holy stones

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.310 
not really new to holy stones
transmitter<00:01:29.150> they're<00:01:29.390> kind<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.840> traditional

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
transmitter they're kind of traditional

they all look real similar there the sky
tech<00:01:32.990> but<00:01:33.740> over<00:01:34.250> here<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.710> left<00:01:36.710> side<00:01:36.890> we

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
tech but over here on the left side we

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.850 
tech but over here on the left side we
have<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.810> will<00:01:38.960> go<00:01:39.050> up<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.410> down<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
have the this will go up and down the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.160 
have the this will go up and down the
throttle<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.490> also<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.510> spins<00:01:41.930> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
throttle and also it spins the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.430 
throttle and also it spins the
quadcopter<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.270> over<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
quadcopter like this and over on the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.890 
quadcopter like this and over on the
other<00:01:45.770> directional<00:01:46.760> we<00:01:47.030> have<00:01:47.240> left<00:01:47.660> right

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
other directional we have left right

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.040 
other directional we have left right
forward<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.160> back<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.600> will<00:01:50.690> make<00:01:50.930> the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
forward and back so that will make the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.610 
forward and back so that will make the
quad<00:01:51.260> go<00:01:51.470> forward<00:01:52.010> back<00:01:52.250> left<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.880> right<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
quad go forward back left and right and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.970 
quad go forward back left and right and
down<00:01:54.620> here<00:01:54.980> is<00:01:55.220> where<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:55.940> have<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.270> trims<00:01:56.630> and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
down here is where we have the trims and

down here is where we have the trims and
we<00:01:57.980> have<00:01:58.220> two<00:01:59.150> different<00:01:59.270> modes<00:01:59.660> on<00:01:59.900> this<00:02:00.110> you

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
we have two different modes on this you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.320 
we have two different modes on this you
can<00:02:00.440> tell<00:02:00.650> which<00:02:00.860> mode<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.760> because<00:02:02.000> it

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
can tell which mode it is is because it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.930 
can tell which mode it is is because it
will<00:02:02.450> beep<00:02:03.350> twice<00:02:03.560> at<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.100> okay<00:02:04.220> we'll<00:02:04.760> go

want<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.070> flip<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.850> go<00:03:17.060> super<00:03:17.360> high<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.960> just

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
want to flip and go super high and just

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.350 
want to flip and go super high and just
start<00:03:18.290> flipping<00:03:18.770> after<00:03:19.760> one<00:03:20.000> after<00:03:20.330> another

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
start flipping after one after another

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.320 
start flipping after one after another
after<00:03:20.750> another<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.030> being<00:03:23.210> said

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
after another so with that being said

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.200 
after another so with that being said
let's<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:23.990> ahead<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.790> use<00:03:25.790> some<00:03:25.940> flying

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
let's just go ahead and use some flying

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.180 
let's just go ahead and use some flying
all<00:03:26.570> right<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.050> before<00:03:27.230> we<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.590> fly<00:03:27.830> want<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
all right so before we go fly want to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.280 
all right so before we go fly want to
point<00:03:28.370> out<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.550> few<00:03:28.640> things<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> forgot<00:03:30.140> to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
point out a few things that I forgot to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.750 
point out a few things that I forgot to
mention<00:03:30.320> here<00:03:30.860> we<00:03:30.980> have<00:03:31.250> these<00:03:31.690> prop<00:03:32.690> bird

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
mention here we have these prop bird

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.730 
mention here we have these prop bird
quadcopter<00:03:34.760> protector<00:03:35.410> things<00:03:36.410> here<00:03:36.680> and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
quadcopter protector things here and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.290 
quadcopter protector things here and
they<00:03:36.860> slide<00:03:37.130> off<00:03:37.340> they<00:03:37.490> come<00:03:37.670> with<00:03:37.850> both<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
they slide off they come with both the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.420 
they slide off they come with both the
red<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.960> the<00:03:39.590> white<00:03:39.770> one<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.280> they're

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
red one and the white one and they're

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.340 
red one and the white one and they're
easy<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:41.000> take<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.390> off<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:41.840> pop<00:03:42.170> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
easy to take on and off you just pop the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.260 
easy to take on and off you just pop the
propeller<00:03:42.710> off<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.280> then<00:03:43.520> slip<00:03:43.880> them<00:03:44.060> on<00:03:44.210> I

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
propeller off and then slip them on I

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.860 
propeller off and then slip them on I
think<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.900> them<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:46.010> right<00:03:46.190> way<00:03:46.870> not

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
think I have them on the right way not

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.390 
think I have them on the right way not
quite<00:03:48.080> sure<00:03:48.110> though<00:03:48.470> but<00:03:48.920> either<00:03:49.010> way<00:03:49.190> that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
quite sure though but either way that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.710 
quite sure though but either way that
it's<00:03:49.550> kind<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.730> snapped<00:03:50.060> right<00:03:50.210> in<00:03:50.480> there<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
it's kind of snapped right in there and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.270 
it's kind of snapped right in there and
also<00:03:51.170> they<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.500> landing<00:03:51.950> gear<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
also they have this landing gear on the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.670 
also they have this landing gear on the
bottom<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.270> landing<00:03:53.660> gear<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.260> fly

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
bottom and the landing gear I fly

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.680 
bottom and the landing gear I fly
without<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.520> can<00:03:55.670> fly<00:03:55.880> either<00:03:56.240> way<00:03:56.630> it

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
without it you can fly either way it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.560 
without it you can fly either way it
just<00:03:56.960> pops<00:03:57.230> out<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.710> then<00:03:57.890> pops<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.570> I

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
just pops out and then pops in I

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.330 
just pops out and then pops in I
actually<00:04:00.080> haven't<00:04:00.470> flown<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.950> yet<00:04:01.130> with<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
actually haven't flown it yet with the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.100 
actually haven't flown it yet with the
landing<00:04:01.670> gear<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.210> I<00:04:02.450> would<00:04:02.840> have<00:04:02.930> seemed

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
landing gear but I would have seemed

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.810 
landing gear but I would have seemed
kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.530> landing<00:04:03.920> gear<00:04:04.100> like<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.490> just

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
kind of like landing gear like this just

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.580 
kind of like landing gear like this just
I<00:04:05.090> don't<00:04:05.330> know<00:04:05.510> why<00:04:05.780> not<00:04:05.930> just<00:04:06.080> fly<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.380> without

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
I don't know why not just fly it without

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.310 
I don't know why not just fly it without
it<00:04:06.920> off<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.490> not<00:04:07.730> really<00:04:08.080> you<00:04:09.080> still

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
it off because it's not really you still

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.710 
it off because it's not really you still
got<00:04:09.440> these<00:04:09.620> four<00:04:09.950> feet<00:04:10.910> here<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.210> can<00:04:11.360> land<00:04:11.540> on

means that will indicate that it's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.290 
means that will indicate that it's
charging<00:04:33.620> in<00:04:34.130> one<00:04:34.400> second<00:04:34.850> here<00:04:35.030> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
as soon as they're charged it's a pretty

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.320 
as soon as they're charged it's a pretty
good<00:04:49.040> idea<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.430> take<00:04:49.610> them<00:04:49.790> off<00:04:49.970> they<00:04:50.210> have<00:04:50.300> a
