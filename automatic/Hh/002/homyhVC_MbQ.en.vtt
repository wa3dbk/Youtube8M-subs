00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.359 
that's a pretty big trade-off and after
about<00:01:46.640> three<00:01:47.060> games<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.659> using<00:01:48.109> this<00:01:48.369> elite

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
about three games of using this elite

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.109 
about three games of using this elite
gun<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.630> have<00:01:51.289> concluded<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:52.429> it<00:01:52.609> is<00:01:52.640> shipped

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
gun I have concluded that it is shipped

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.510 
gun I have concluded that it is shipped
personally<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:54.320> don't<00:01:54.499> see<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.920> difference<00:01:55.159> in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
personally I don't see a difference in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.669 
personally I don't see a difference in
the<00:01:55.670> reload<00:01:56.060> time<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.960> aim-down-sight

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the reload time in the aim-down-sight

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.190 
the reload time in the aim-down-sight
time<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.219> don't<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:58.759> handling<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.420> but

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
time I don't know what handling is but

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.989 
time I don't know what handling is but
it<00:02:00.350> does<00:02:00.619> nothing<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.490> don't<00:02:01.670> know<00:02:01.789> why<00:02:01.969> I

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
it does nothing and I don't know why I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.760 
it does nothing and I don't know why I
have<00:02:02.270> three<00:02:02.600> extra<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:03.140> them<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:03.619> then<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
have three extra of them but then I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.620 
have three extra of them but then I
think<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.130> myself<00:02:04.219> maybe<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.060> doesn't<00:02:05.270> suck

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
think to myself maybe it doesn't suck

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.599 
think to myself maybe it doesn't suck
complete<00:02:06.170> dick<00:02:06.530> because<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.890> just<00:02:07.039> went<00:02:07.189> twenty

because<00:04:39.620> personally<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:40.010> think<00:04:40.100> I'd<00:04:40.310> rather

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
because personally I think I'd rather

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.390 
because personally I think I'd rather
use<00:04:40.669> just<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:41.000> default<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.600> Kay<00:04:41.889> than<00:04:42.889> this<00:04:43.130> gun

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
use just a default a Kay than this gun

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.610 
use just a default a Kay than this gun
so<00:04:44.060> personally<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:44.600> think<00:04:44.810> if<00:04:45.229> you<00:04:45.380> get<00:04:45.500> this

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
so personally I think if you get this

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.689 
so personally I think if you get this
gun<00:04:45.830> from<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.010> Supply<00:04:46.220> Drop

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
gun from a Supply Drop

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.700 
gun from a Supply Drop
you<00:04:46.880> should<00:04:47.120> redeem<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.600> for<00:04:47.630> X<00:04:47.840> because<00:04:48.050> it's

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
you should redeem it for X because it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:59.200 
you should redeem it for X because it's
not<00:04:48.919> very<00:04:49.310> good<00:04:49.720> whatsoever<00:04:50.720> uh<00:04:57.190> well<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:59.000> is

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
not very good whatsoever uh well this is

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.419 
not very good whatsoever uh well this is
awkward
