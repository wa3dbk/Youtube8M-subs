00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090 
cheap stuff and they're going to exploit
it<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.180> as<00:01:27.180> far<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:28.259> all

it but as far as I can see right now all
the<00:01:29.430> guns<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.930> practically<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.960> same<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.380> mean

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the guns are practically the same I mean

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
the guns are practically the same I mean
all<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.009> snow<00:01:32.189> rifles<00:01:32.640> handle<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> same

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
all this snow rifles handle the same

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.749 
all this snow rifles handle the same
also<00:01:33.540> machine<00:01:34.049> guns<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.640> pretty<00:01:35.640> much

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
also machine guns are pretty much

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.780 
also machine guns are pretty much
colognes<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> each<00:01:36.360> other<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.159> all<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.460> I'm

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
colognes of each other so all right I'm

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.069 
colognes of each other so all right I'm
not<00:01:39.000> sure<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> weapon<00:01:39.750> balance

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
not sure about the weapon balance

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.179 
not sure about the weapon balance
submachine<00:01:40.799> guns<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.659> good

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
submachine guns are really really good

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.980 
submachine guns are really really good
like<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> fire<00:01:44.579> rate<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.210> amazing<00:01:45.600> on

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
like the fire rate is just amazing on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.450 
like the fire rate is just amazing on
the<00:01:46.110> submachine<00:01:46.470> gun<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.280> sell

about the Katie but for the most part

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
about the Katie but for the most part
connections<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.810> pretty<00:02:27.989> decent<00:02:28.380> average

for bar every game hit detection is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600 
for bar every game hit detection is
pretty<00:02:31.380> solid<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.010> lot<00:02:32.250> better<00:02:32.400> than

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
pretty solid it's a lot better than

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.350 
pretty solid it's a lot better than

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
black ops one on the hit detection uh

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.509 
black ops one on the hit detection uh
just<00:02:36.360> some<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:37.140> minor<00:02:37.560> details<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.310> kind<00:02:38.489> of

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
just some little minor details I kind of

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.970 
just some little minor details I kind of
hold<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.910> game<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.470> die<00:02:40.680> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
hold this game back one you die really

fast<00:02:41.099> like<00:02:41.959> I'll<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.170> explain<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:43.890> is

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
fast like I'll not explain it this is

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.740 
fast like I'll not explain it this is
most<00:02:44.610> likely<00:02:44.880> something<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.569> like

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
most likely something to do with like

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.800 
most likely something to do with like
the<00:02:46.380> servers<00:02:46.799> or<00:02:46.920> something<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.610> will<00:02:48.480> aim

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the servers or something but I will aim

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.930 
the servers or something but I will aim
at<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.049> guy<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> will<00:02:49.500> shoot<00:02:49.830> at<00:02:49.980> him<00:02:50.130> four<00:02:50.819> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
at a guy I will shoot at him four to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.789 
at a guy I will shoot at him four to
five<00:02:51.120> times<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.720> he<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.080> instantly<00:02:52.500> drops

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
five times and he just instantly drops

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.920 
five times and he just instantly drops
me<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:54.330> don't<00:02:54.480> know<00:02:54.569> how<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> explain

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
me it's I just don't know how to explain

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.220 
me it's I just don't know how to explain
it<00:02:55.049> it's<00:02:55.350> really<00:02:55.620> weird<00:02:55.799> uh<00:02:56.720> especially<00:02:57.720> since

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
it it's really weird uh especially since

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.630 
it it's really weird uh especially since
it<00:02:58.350> says<00:02:58.500> I'm<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.739> four<00:02:59.040> bar<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.250> mean<00:02:59.549> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it says I'm on a four bar I mean the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.309 
it says I'm on a four bar I mean the
connection<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.080> does<00:03:01.290> feel

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
connection is good it really does feel

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.280 
connection is good it really does feel
like<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.950> four<00:03:02.310> bar<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.209> those<00:03:04.049> times

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
like a four bar but I just those times

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
like a four bar but I just those times
when<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.530> instantly<00:03:04.980> die<00:03:05.190> you're<00:03:05.459> asking

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
when you instantly die you're asking

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.740 
when you instantly die you're asking
yourself<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:07.019> what<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:07.500> happened<00:03:07.950> but

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
yourself like what just happened but

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
yourself like what just happened but
let's<00:03:09.750> see<00:03:09.930> what<00:03:09.959> else<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.410> uh<00:03:10.440> what<00:03:11.190> else<00:03:11.340> can

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
let's see what else is uh what else can

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.089 
let's see what else is uh what else can
I<00:03:11.519> say<00:03:11.580> about<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.090> game<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:13.590> detection<00:03:14.040> is

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
I say about this game it detection is

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.309 
I say about this game it detection is
good<00:03:14.299> one<00:03:15.299> thing<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.480> don't<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
good one thing I don't like is how the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.900 
good one thing I don't like is how the
killstreaks<00:03:17.040> are<00:03:17.220> unlocked<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.760> mean

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
killstreaks are unlocked I mean

Blackbird at low 42 or something I mean

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.729 
Blackbird at low 42 or something I mean
what's<00:03:21.810> wrong<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.109> letting<00:03:22.200> us<00:03:22.380> choose<00:03:22.620> our

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
what's wrong with letting us choose our

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.490 
what's wrong with letting us choose our
own<00:03:22.799> killstreaks<00:03:23.370> especially<00:03:24.230> because<00:03:25.230> the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
I'm liking it so far you have to play

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.970 
I'm liking it so far you have to play
solo<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.420> ps3<00:04:33.720> otherwise<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.470> can't<00:04:34.650> find<00:04:34.890> a

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
solo on ps3 otherwise you can't find a

game but I mean hit detection is good
weapon<00:04:37.680> balance<00:04:37.980> seems<00:04:38.310> okay<00:04:38.700> for<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.000> most

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150

challenging<00:04:48.480> I<00:04:48.960> don't<00:04:49.140> know<00:04:49.230> why<00:04:49.380> maybe<00:04:49.650> it's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
challenging I don't know why maybe it's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.580 
challenging I don't know why maybe it's
the<00:04:49.950> maps<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.610> maps<00:04:50.820> in<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.090> game<00:04:51.300> are

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
saboteurs they're a bit worse than

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.320 
saboteurs they're a bit worse than
modern<00:04:54.900> warfare<00:04:55.050> 3<00:04:55.230> maps<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.090> one<00:04:57.090> thing<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
modern warfare 3 maps I one thing I

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.840 
modern warfare 3 maps I one thing I

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.440 
working model in a black ops 2 just I'm
not<00:05:31.230> sure<00:05:31.410> why<00:05:31.560> man<00:05:31.860> maybe<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.730> UAV<00:05:33.150> spam

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
not sure why man maybe it's the UAV spam

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.140 
not sure why man maybe it's the UAV spam
which<00:05:33.630> is<00:05:33.750> really<00:05:33.990> an<00:05:34.680> UAV<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.520> powerful<00:05:36.060> in

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150

which is really an UAV is powerful in
this<00:05:36.270> game<00:05:36.920> probably<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.070> best<00:05:38.280> killstreak

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
this game probably the best killstreak

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.360 
this game probably the best killstreak
because<00:05:39.120> ghost<00:05:39.720> is<00:05:39.900> unlocked<00:05:40.200> at<00:05:40.320> level<00:05:40.350> 55<00:05:40.860> so

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
because ghost is unlocked at level 55 so

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.960 
because ghost is unlocked at level 55 so
