00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.110

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880 
so number five we have Stein of itch and
I<00:00:36.450> thought<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> sabers<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.140> amazing<00:00:37.739> because

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I thought the sabers are amazing because

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
I thought the sabers are amazing because
it's<00:00:38.190> literally<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> header<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.090> headers<00:00:39.300> are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's literally a header and headers are

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
it's literally a header and headers are
really<00:00:39.540> hard<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> save<00:00:40.469> against<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.640> fee<00:00:41.760> for

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really hard to save against in a fee for

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
really hard to save against in a fee for
15<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.329> any<00:00:42.510> fever<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.930> fact<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.379> always<00:00:43.469> Opie

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
15 or any fever in fact that always Opie

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
15 or any fever in fact that always Opie
and<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> cross<00:00:45.329> him<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> top

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and it was going to cross him in the top

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.060 
and it was going to cross him in the top
corner<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> thought<00:00:46.770> wasn't<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
corner and I just thought wasn't a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
corner and I just thought wasn't a
really<00:00:47.399> good<00:00:47.579> save<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.090> don't<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> guys<00:00:48.750> think

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.540 

alright<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.620> number<00:00:55.829> four<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
alright so at number four we have the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.849 
alright so at number four we have the
fortress<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> 1v2<00:00:57.600> situation<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> first

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
fortress in a 1v2 situation the first

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
fortress in a 1v2 situation the first
shot<00:00:59.100> saved<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.640> well<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> second

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
shot saved as well and then the second

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.849

one<00:01:00.750> cleared<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> line<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> thought<00:01:01.770> has

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
one cleared of the line I thought has

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
one cleared of the line I thought has
already<00:01:02.010> outstanding<00:01:02.520> safe<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.120> offside

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
already outstanding safe it was offside

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
already outstanding safe it was offside
but<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.780> thought<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
but I thought I put it in any way as the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
but I thought I put it in any way as the
second<00:01:05.369> set<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.519> amazing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.990

really<00:01:38.710> good<00:01:38.890> triple<00:01:39.250> save<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.610> number<00:01:45.850> two<00:01:45.940> we

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
thought but I thought the save is

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.500 
thought but I thought the save is
actually<00:01:51.280> really<00:01:51.430> outstanding<00:01:51.729> it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
actually really outstanding it's

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.730 
actually really outstanding it's
probably<00:01:52.720> what<00:01:52.840> my<00:01:52.930> favorite<00:01:53.110> ones<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:53.590> hard

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
probably what my favorite ones it's hard

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.100 
probably what my favorite ones it's hard
shooting<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:54.280> one<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.510> other<00:01:55.540> one<00:01:55.780> for

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
shooting this one and the other one for

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.900 
shooting this one and the other one for
number<00:01:56.320> one<00:01:56.500> spot<00:01:56.800> but<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.490> can<00:01:57.580> see<00:01:57.729> he's

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
number one spot but as you can see he's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.950 
number one spot but as you can see he's
not<00:01:58.000> actually<00:01:58.150> positioned<00:01:58.450> but<00:01:58.720> he<00:01:58.780> managed

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
not actually positioned but he managed

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.480 
not actually positioned but he managed
to<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.170> himself<00:01:59.229> across<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.920> goal<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.250> stop<00:02:00.460> a

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
to get himself across the goal to stop a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.219 
to get himself across the goal to stop a
power<00:02:00.729> shot<00:02:01.060> into<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.690> bottom<00:02:02.050> right<00:02:02.170> hand

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
power shot into the bottom right hand

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.960 
power shot into the bottom right hand
corner<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.460> thought<00:02:03.580> that's<00:02:03.700> really

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
corner and I just thought that's really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.300 
injury time but he's going to be putting
a<00:02:22.430> 1v4<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.510> he<00:02:23.570> makes<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> save<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.860> initials

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310

pushing he makes the initial second save

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.560 
pushing he makes the initial second save
as<00:02:28.610> well<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.820> thought<00:02:29.090> these<00:02:29.180> saves<00:02:29.420> are

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
as well I thought these saves are

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.270 
as well I thought these saves are
absolutely<00:02:29.959> outstanding<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.130> one

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
absolutely outstanding and the one

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.620 
absolutely outstanding and the one
that's<00:02:31.430> coming<00:02:31.550> next<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.270> thought<00:02:32.390> was

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's coming next I just thought was

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.910 
that's coming next I just thought was
probably<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.140> my<00:02:33.200> favorite<00:02:33.500> days<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
probably one of my favorite days of the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.040 
probably one of my favorite days of the
week<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.490> thought<00:02:35.030> was<00:02:35.300> outstandings<00:02:35.690> at<00:02:35.840> these

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
week I thought was outstandings at these

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
week I thought was outstandings at these
out<00:02:36.200> position<00:02:36.560> completely<00:02:36.800> here<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.640> shoot

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
out position completely here they shoot

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.070 
out position completely here they shoot
front<00:02:38.060> post<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.390> he<00:02:38.480> managed<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.720> push<00:02:38.959> it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
front post and he managed to push it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.850 
front post and he managed to push it
around<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.290> thought<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.500> was<00:02:39.650> absolutely

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
around I thought I was absolutely

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.850 
around I thought I was absolutely
amazing<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.959> wasn't<00:02:42.230> for<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.440> last<00:02:42.620> save

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
amazing if it wasn't for that last save

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.810 
amazing if it wasn't for that last save
I<00:02:42.980> don't<00:02:43.100> know<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.370> would<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.550> in<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> top

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
I don't know if it would be in the top

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.250 
I don't know if it would be in the top
five<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.239> would<00:02:44.390> be<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.600> number<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:44.840> anyway

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
five it would be the number one anyway

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260 
five it would be the number one anyway
but<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.770> thought<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.040> safe<00:02:46.370> was<00:02:46.640> outstanding

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
but I thought that safe was outstanding

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.850 
but I thought that safe was outstanding
to<00:02:47.570> push<00:02:47.720> around<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.080> post<00:02:48.290> when<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.620> was<00:02:48.709> in
