it<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.730> cool<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.649> strikes<00:00:46.950> me

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it can be cool but with what strikes me

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.000 
it can be cool but with what strikes me
what<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.950> decides<00:00:50.030> overly<00:00:51.030> wide<00:00:52.010> which

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
what is that decides overly wide which

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.819 
what is that decides overly wide which
means<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.239> flank<00:00:54.829> really

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
means that people can flank really

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.369 
means that people can flank really
easily<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.710> with<00:00:58.710> covel<00:00:59.270> now<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.629> boil<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.530 
a flag couple and you were the left it's
just<00:01:58.850> instantaneous<00:01:59.850> stuff<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.420> them

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
just instantaneous stuff for them

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
just instantaneous stuff for them
basically<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.219> guy's<00:02:02.460> trying

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
basically as you see this guy's trying

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.660 
basically as you see this guy's trying
to<00:02:02.880> escape<00:02:03.060> from<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.409> middle<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to escape from the you know middle and I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
to escape from the you know middle and I
think<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.000> might<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.180> double<00:02:06.600> XP<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.290> don't

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
think it might be double XP I don't

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.390 
think it might be double XP I don't
really<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:10.009> yeah

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
really know about that and yeah

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.170 
really know about that and yeah
so<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:13.079> what<00:02:13.260> else<00:02:13.409> can<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.650> say<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.099> like<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so what what else can I say I like the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
so what what else can I say I like the
environment<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.079> stamp<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.500> guess<00:02:16.769> it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
environment of the stamp I guess it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.039 
environment of the stamp I guess it
means<00:02:17.189> it's<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.849> lot<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.060> unique<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.720> this

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
three violence where you guys but the

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.990 
three violence where you guys but the
grenade<00:05:28.560> buttons<00:05:28.979> are<00:05:29.130> supposed<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.460> be<00:05:29.550> small

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
grenade buttons are supposed to be small

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080 
grenade buttons are supposed to be small
so<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:31.020> more<00:05:31.229> accurate<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:32.130> they<00:05:32.789> should<00:05:33.000> be

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
so the more accurate and they should be

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.879 
so the more accurate and they should be
less<00:05:33.270> sensitive<00:05:33.539> that's<00:05:34.139> just<00:05:34.260> how<00:05:34.349> you<00:05:34.500> need

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
less sensitive that's just how you need

less sensitive that's just how you need
it<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.490> should<00:05:35.760> be<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.500> shooting<00:05:37.500> but<00:05:37.949> it

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
should be a lot more sensitive and with

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.670
