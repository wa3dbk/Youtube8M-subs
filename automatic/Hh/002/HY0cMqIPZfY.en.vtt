00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.700
The project is a mixture between swing and be-bop, the music of Django Reinhardt and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.700
the music of Charlie Parker. All the tracks on the album are Charlie Parker’s, except 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.000
one by Dizzy Gillespie, who was the trumpeter who used to play with him.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.990
We are recording David Regueiro Swingtet's second album, with a very 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.240
special and very different set from the previous album "... On Stage". It's an album 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.060
where we find a set of two quite different sections, on one side 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
we have the manouche trio, of which I am part with Iago Reigosa, guitar, and 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.959
Juyma Estévez, bass. And on the other side we have the horns, the most be-bop 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.959
section of the band. Toño Otero, alto saxophonist and Javier Pereiro, aka Gdjazz, on trumpet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.500
David Regueiro, as a manouche guitarist, I think he is a wonder.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Iago Reigosa and Juyma Estévez played on the previous album and we have been 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.840
playing a long time together, they are also involved with me in this thing called manouche.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:09.000
Iago Reigosa accompanying ... Brutal! His way of playing La Pompe is very groovy,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I feel great playing with him.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.510
One of the reasons to make this record, besides loving the music of Charlie Parker,  is that

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.350
we are not many who play jazz manouche in Galicia (Spain) but there is an amazing American jazz scene. 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.730
There are incredible musicians, and two of them are Javier Pereiro,  

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.350
trumpeter, and Toño Otero, saxophonist. And this project is a way to do 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.040
something in common with them, bringing our manouche 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.040
and their American jazz.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.970
This was the chance to go one step further and get into the last stage of Django style 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.930
already touched by be-bop.
You have these two worlds, you see how they are interspersed, 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.500
how the sonorities are mixture…

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
As far as I know, there is no precedent of playing Charlie Parker’s compositions in manouche. 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.490
Donna Lee is an often played tune in the context of manouche as well as other songs, 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.490
but making a kind of monograph, as we are doing, about the music

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.000
 of Charlie Parker in Gypsy Swing, as far as I know, has not been done so far.
