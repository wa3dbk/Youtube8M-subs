00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.230
 28 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.800
 hello people today i want to be with you 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.419
 Crochet a dress 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.380
 you can do this for the top part 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.480
 instruction from the dutchman with the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.360
 Triangle pattern take what yes also completely 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.660
 Great comes over I think it looks quite 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.030
 apart from that, the words that i am about here 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.480
 have used twice from the outside 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.560
 and once inside, it certainly does 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.750
 to recognize very well 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.230
 first the pool or crochet normally 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250
 only below, we will no longer words 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.080
 replace it 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.540
 as I have done in the pullunder 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:13.040
 but we will be under ours 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.259
 lace patterns naturally set a lot 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.790
 a lot about it come the linked 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.930
 I just brought you back to the top right in 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.930
 the corner exactly and then at the end 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.110
 then comes again the words straight 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.560
 down here I have seven stitches 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.140
 Remember to get the same which means I 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.830
 have for our bigger than it slides 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.070
 are 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.040
 I'll say between 34 and 38 I think 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.610
 Can one wear this variant? 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.530
 I crocheted I have six 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.220
 Pattern taken on each side once 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.200
 before and once back 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.460
 to which I have just make it here 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.460
 have to keep more 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.040
 but that makes you count yourself then 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.539
 from that you are about the same 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.420
 that's what the whole thing really is 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:18.230
 on center with out or the sides 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.050
 really necessary so you do not get up 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.110
 once the pattern 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.400
 Pine wise somewhere, you count yourself 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 that's no witchcraft for one 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.930
 pattern you need 14 stitches 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.780
 because you can who a wider hips 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.400
 in tact more 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.400
 we are just the devices 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.420
 I took the normal one 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 you take this violence that really great 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.920
 here I am there so it is 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.200
 really great and is also great 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.770
 beautiful in so me have the bear the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 yes good 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.210
 Of course you can of the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 long ago I've always this 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.290
 I try on the length 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.180
 I liked the most 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.380
 the younger will be that all a 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.980
 make it shorter 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.290
 No problem always looks great though 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.850
 if you stop in the years 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.850
 I always say a little longer 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.530
 and as I said six patterns in the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.480
 wide and I got that then had 246 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.000
 I have made 100 eight times 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.670
 I think about things when they are 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.700
 then the whole might think times 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.010
 or maybe seven times 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.630
 it all depends on brother sitting and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.380
 I like showing a little hand reaches 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.970
 something goes knee 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.720
 I like it best of course you can 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.310
 even as rock the whole work 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.020
 but then you have to if you do that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.730
 just wanted to do as a top hammer already 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.800
 made yes again on the top right 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.140
 Can you just stew apart 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.390
 apple and avira so unfortunately that has me 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.950
 but if I now the pattern 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.109
 Of course you can only do that, of course 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.049
 as a rottmann but you have to then 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.659
 above one 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.569
 at least five centimeters approximately 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.789
 the whole stretch in 1 left one 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.159
 right or two guys reveals it 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.990
 we also keep that in the top because 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.960
 otherwise slip the otherwise bring 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.000
 you have to look there already then how does 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.840
 you can do it all on your hips 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 but is otherwise no wizardry the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.599
 said to bring beautiful part 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.639
 we will give you some more pictures 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:58.919
 I can only say a lot of fun with it and 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:59.580
 also when wearing so until the next 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.009
 times 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.009
 I wish you all the best
