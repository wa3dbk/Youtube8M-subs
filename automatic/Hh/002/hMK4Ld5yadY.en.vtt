00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.279 
also change the jump height so jump of
orange<00:01:34.999> to<00:01:36.189> fall<00:01:37.189> yeah<00:01:38.179> let's<00:01:38.929> go<00:01:39.049> with<00:01:39.139> that

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
orange to fall yeah let's go with that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.459 
orange to fall yeah let's go with that
that's<00:01:39.920> fine<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:41.240> once<00:01:41.450> you've<00:01:41.630> done<00:01:41.779> that<00:01:41.840> we

that's fine so once you've done that we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.230 
that's fine so once you've done that we
need<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.099> actually<00:01:43.249> set<00:01:43.609> the<00:01:43.670> blocks<00:01:43.999> of<00:01:44.209> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
need to actually set the blocks of the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.739 
need to actually set the blocks of the
arena

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
arena

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.230 
arena
that<00:01:44.959> players<00:01:45.319> can<00:01:45.679> run<00:01:45.889> on<00:01:46.069> without<00:01:46.490> losing

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
that players can run on without losing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.089 
that players can run on without losing
and<00:01:47.450> go<00:01:47.569> back<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.020> checkpoint<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.889> if<00:01:48.979> you

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
and go back to the checkpoint so if you

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:50.620 
and go back to the checkpoint so if you
grab<00:01:49.279> all<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.729> blocks<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.060> you've<00:01:50.299> used

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
within the arena and the arena set

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.109 
within the arena and the arena set
clocks<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:55.340> orange

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
clocks for orange

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.419 
clocks for orange
let<00:01:56.659> go<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.950> arena<00:01:58.189> blocks

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
let go and that's as the arena blocks

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.269 
let go and that's as the arena blocks
have<00:01:58.579> been<00:01:58.700> set<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.139> a<00:02:00.229> player<00:02:00.499> jumps<00:02:00.979> off

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:01.279 
have been set so if a player jumps off

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.449 
have been set so if a player jumps off
and<00:02:01.520> hits<00:02:01.849> another<00:02:02.179> block<00:02:02.509> or<00:02:02.899> water<00:02:03.459> they

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
and hits another block or water they

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.690 
and hits another block or water they
lose<00:02:04.669> as<00:02:04.999> you<00:02:05.239> will<00:02:05.359> see<00:02:05.630> within<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:07.340> gameplay

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
lose as you will see within the gameplay

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.480 
lose as you will see within the gameplay
at<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.909> end

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
at the end

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.310 
at the end
so<00:02:09.120> once<00:02:09.450> we've<00:02:09.600> done<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.990> need<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.260> add

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
so once we've done that we need to add

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020 
so once we've done that we need to add
some<00:02:10.500> checkpoints<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.370> check<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:11.940> it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
some checkpoints and check but it's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
some checkpoints and check but it's
pretty<00:02:12.150> cool<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.080> grab<00:02:13.530> our<00:02:13.740> world<00:02:13.980> at

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
pretty cool so if we grab our world at

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
pretty cool so if we grab our world at
it<00:02:14.540> acts<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.320> select<00:02:17.150> an<00:02:18.150> area<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:19.380> way

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it acts we can select an area the way

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.810 
it acts we can select an area the way
you<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:21.000> select<00:02:22.370> sort<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> floor

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you do that is you select sort the floor

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.670 
you do that is you select sort the floor
and<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.120> don't<00:02:24.300> need<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> height<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and you don't need to have a height to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
and you don't need to have a height to
make<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> cuboid<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> floor

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
make the cuboid that's just the floor

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.860 
make the cuboid that's just the floor
area<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.360> arena

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
area so like this and then you do arena

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.310 
area so like this and then you do arena
add<00:02:31.560> points<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.850> orange<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.720> inside<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
add points or orange and inside of the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.210 
add points or orange and inside of the
first<00:02:34.920> checkpoint<00:02:36.560> maybe<00:02:37.560> another<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.040> down

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
first checkpoint maybe another one down

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.750 
first checkpoint maybe another one down
here<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:40.380> point<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.550> that's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
here like this at point and that's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
here like this at point and that's
handed<00:02:42.120> another<00:02:42.660> point<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.480> arena<00:02:45.690> which

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
handed another point to the arena which

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.760 
handed another point to the arena which
is<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:46.920> cool<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.350> whilst<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.530> need

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
is really really cool so whilst we need

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.820 
is really really cool so whilst we need
to<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:49.950> well<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.670> actually<00:02:51.330> need<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.680> don't

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
to do well we actually need to we don't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
to do well we actually need to we don't
need<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.280> be<00:02:53.460> particles<00:02:54.300> which<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.510> cool

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
need to this be particles which is cool

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.850 
need to this be particles which is cool
so<00:02:55.170> arena<00:02:55.800> set<00:02:56.250> particles<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.290> let<00:02:58.290> me<00:02:58.380> find<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
so arena set particles and let me find a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.970 
so arena set particles and let me find a
cool<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.640> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.300> speaker<00:03:01.230> page<00:03:01.470> there<00:03:01.860> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
cool one so on the speaker page there is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.760 
cool one so on the speaker page there is
a<00:03:02.010> particle<00:03:02.400> list<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.110> there<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.260> quite<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> lot

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
a particle list and there is quite a lot

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.670 
a particle list and there is quite a lot
of<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.220> what<00:03:05.340> we<00:03:05.490> want<00:03:06.350> but<00:03:07.350> let's<00:03:07.500> just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
of them so what we want but let's just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.640 
of them so what we want but let's just
go<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.970> cloud<00:03:08.970> not<00:03:09.810> sure<00:03:10.050> what<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.410> looks

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
go with cloud not sure what this looks

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.140 
go with cloud not sure what this looks
like<00:03:10.740> but<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.720> would<00:03:12.960> look<00:03:13.170> pretty<00:03:13.530> nice<00:03:14.150> now

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
like but that would look pretty nice now

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.990 
like but that would look pretty nice now
we've<00:03:15.360> done<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:15.840> actually<00:03:16.350> set<00:03:17.220> up<00:03:17.550> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
we've done that we can actually set up a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.070 
we've done that we can actually set up a
lobby<00:03:18.630> which<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.170> going<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.310> tree

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
lobby which is going to be in this tree

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.540 
lobby which is going to be in this tree
right<00:03:22.080> here<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.100> arena<00:03:23.670> set<00:03:24.420> lobby<00:03:25.280> like<00:03:26.280> so

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
right here so arena set lobby like so

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.010 
right here so arena set lobby like so
and<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:27.840> believe<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:31.700> most<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> arena

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
and I believe that is most of the arena

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.860 
and I believe that is most of the arena
done<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.800> do<00:03:34.920> both<00:03:35.850> arena

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
done so you can do both arena

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.140 
done so you can do both arena
poggle<00:03:38.420> orange

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
poggle orange

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
poggle orange
and<00:03:42.150> now<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:42.930> been<00:03:43.110> changed<00:03:43.410> waiting<00:03:43.830> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and now it's been changed waiting to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.010 
and now it's been changed waiting to
people<00:03:44.310> who<00:03:44.400> let<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.700> play<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.810> now<00:03:45.960> we

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
people who let you play it so now we

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.010 
people who let you play it so now we
need<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> create<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.830> join<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.610> leave<00:03:47.720> NPCs<00:03:48.720> so

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
need to create a join and leave NPCs so

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.190 
need to create a join and leave NPCs so
let's<00:03:49.230> hop<00:03:49.590> over<00:03:49.920> here<00:03:49.950> do<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.060> such<00:03:51.300> NPC<00:03:51.990> and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
let's hop over here do for such NPC and

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.670 
let's hop over here do for such NPC and
then<00:03:53.190> create<00:03:53.760> we're<00:03:54.570> going<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> cool<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.410> a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
then create we're going to cool it and a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.360 
then create we're going to cool it and a
and<00:03:55.890> L<00:03:56.460> which<00:03:56.850> will<00:03:57.090> give<00:03:57.270> it<00:03:57.390> color<00:03:57.570> join<00:03:58.370> so

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
and L which will give it color join so

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.360 
and L which will give it color join so
now<00:03:59.730> we've<00:03:59.850> got<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.150> bloke<00:04:00.860> looks<00:04:01.860> quite<00:04:02.250> off

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
now we've got this bloke looks quite off

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.860 
now we've got this bloke looks quite off
but<00:04:02.670> we<00:04:02.760> can<00:04:02.940> change<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.360> which<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> really

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
but we can change it which is really

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330 
but we can change it which is really
awesome<00:04:03.960> so<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.680> change<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.070> maybe<00:04:05.220> a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
awesome so we can change it to maybe a

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.170 
awesome so we can change it to maybe a
slime<00:04:06.080> by<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.280> we<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.430> make<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.580> leave<00:04:08.820> one<00:04:09.060> as

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
slime by that we can make a leave one as

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.070 
slime by that we can make a leave one as
well<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.830> do<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> same<00:04:11.390> with<00:04:12.390> leave<00:04:12.690> and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
well so we do the same with leave and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.950 
well so we do the same with leave and
maybe<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.500> color<00:04:13.740> red

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
maybe the color red

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.760 
maybe the color red
symbolizing<00:04:15.960> exit<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.850> see

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770

gameplay which I've already filmed on

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.590 
gameplay which I've already filmed on
the<00:05:15.720> test<00:05:15.930> server<00:05:16.110> as<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.410> said<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.060> yeah<00:05:18.060> enjoy

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
the test server as I said and yeah enjoy

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.630 
the test server as I said and yeah enjoy
that<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:19.260> I'm<00:05:19.440> on<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.800> test<00:05:20.130> server<00:05:20.340> at<00:05:20.580> the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
that so I'm on the test server at the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.660 
that so I'm on the test server at the
moment<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.180> as<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.450> can<00:05:21.660> see<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.170> have<00:05:23.130> got<00:05:23.460> to

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
moment and as you can see I have got to

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.490 
moment and as you can see I have got to
a<00:05:23.700> checkpoint<00:05:24.090> over<00:05:24.510> there<00:05:24.690> indicated<00:05:25.380> by<00:05:25.440> the

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
a checkpoint over there indicated by the

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.970 
a checkpoint over there indicated by the
particles<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:27.660> was<00:05:27.810> an<00:05:27.930> awful<00:05:28.410> jump<00:05:28.650> so

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
particles and that was an awful jump so

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.470 
particles and that was an awful jump so
let<00:05:29.310> me<00:05:29.430> try<00:05:29.760> that<00:05:29.910> again

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
let me try that again

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.870 
let me try that again
ooh<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:31.170> was<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.290> nice<00:05:31.440> jump<00:05:31.680> I'm<00:05:32.400> going<00:05:32.820> to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
ooh that was a nice jump I'm going to

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.910 
ooh that was a nice jump I'm going to
try<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.120> get<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.420> end<00:05:33.510> but<00:05:34.080> probably<00:05:34.770> not

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
try and get to the end but probably not

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.080 
try and get to the end but probably not
gonna<00:05:35.070> be<00:05:35.190> able<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.700> I've<00:05:35.760> got<00:05:35.910> some

gonna be able to and I've got some

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.550 
gonna be able to and I've got some
people<00:05:36.390> on<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.630> right<00:05:36.810> which<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.230> can<00:05:37.380> see

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
people on the right which you can see

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.090 
people on the right which you can see
indicated<00:05:38.100> by<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.960> scoreboard<00:05:39.960> there<00:05:40.830> we<00:05:40.920> go

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
indicated by the scoreboard there we go

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.550 
indicated by the scoreboard there we go
I've<00:05:41.760> hit<00:05:42.000> another<00:05:42.210> checkpoint<00:05:42.510> doing<00:05:43.290> pretty

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
I've hit another checkpoint doing pretty

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.930 
I've hit another checkpoint doing pretty
well<00:05:43.680> at<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.070> moment

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.120 

ignore<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.080> time<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:48.620> was<00:05:48.770> playing<00:05:48.920> this

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
ignore the time I was playing this

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.230 
ignore the time I was playing this
earlier<00:05:49.490> and<00:05:49.670> then<00:05:50.600> left<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.530> now<00:05:51.830> I'm<00:05:51.950> back

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
earlier and then left and now I'm back

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.540 
earlier and then left and now I'm back
so<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:54.140> is<00:05:54.350> pretty<00:05:54.740> difficult<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.740> don't

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
so this is pretty difficult so don't

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.710 
so this is pretty difficult so don't
expect<00:05:58.640> me<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.030> do<00:05:59.540> very<00:05:59.780> well<00:05:59.890> and<00:06:00.890> my<00:06:01.820> fps<00:06:02.570> is

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
expect me to do very well and my fps is

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.610 
expect me to do very well and my fps is

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
around a thousand if I go back to the

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.540 
around a thousand if I go back to the
hub<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.450> do<00:06:11.630> server<00:06:12.110> hub<00:06:12.590> you<00:06:13.070> can<00:06:13.280> actually

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
hub and do server hub you can actually

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.120 
hub and do server hub you can actually
see<00:06:14.000> if<00:06:14.090> anyone's<00:06:14.420> around<00:06:14.540> here<00:06:14.930> there<00:06:15.860> isn't

see if anyone's around here there isn't

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.820 
see if anyone's around here there isn't
so<00:06:16.490> if<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.670> go<00:06:16.850> back<00:06:17.330> to<00:06:17.360> speedrun<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:18.200> will<00:06:18.620> join

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
so if I go back to speedrun it will join

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.020 
so if I go back to speedrun it will join
the<00:06:18.980> game<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:20.710> yeah<00:06:21.710> we<00:06:21.950> could<00:06:22.130> just<00:06:22.730> chill

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
let's see if we can not fail that jump

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.390 
let's see if we can not fail that jump
so<00:06:35.660> here<00:06:35.930> we<00:06:36.020> go<00:06:38.770> we<00:06:39.770> go<00:06:40.070> yes<00:06:40.670> nice<00:06:41.450> lovely<00:06:42.020> oh
