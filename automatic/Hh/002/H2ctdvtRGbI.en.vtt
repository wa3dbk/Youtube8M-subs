00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 peach jam made without 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.260
 Peach impossible, you will not see it here 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.530
 we have the ingredients for the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.299
 jam we will need about 400 or 500 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 grams of pumpkin 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.160
 we are going to also use gelatine in sheets or 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 in powder and for those who prefer the load 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 at the end of the video I also show you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 as it is done with agar according to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.740
 flavoring peach we will use a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 about instant tea without sugar as 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.510
 this one is not really a preparation 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.760
 to make tea flavored soft drink 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.890
 peach there is also lemon and each 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.410
 about bring enough for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 prepare half a liter of soda you'd better 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 also peach flavor powder juice 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.270
 mature not like those of libya and I live their 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 co 0 or cristian light anyone who does not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
 carry sugar we will start with gelatin 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 We are going to put it in the same container 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 in which then we will make the jam and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.949
 well and stain we have less pots 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.320
 We are going to use only half of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.390
 gelatin powder about 5 grams and the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 we'll save it for the next time 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.210
 to make it in jelly with jelly 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 in leaves 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.400
 with three leaves if you cut them into pieces 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.979
 they will melt better we cover the gelatin 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.159
 with 50 milliliters of cold water 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.320
 these are about 6 tablespoons if 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 you put a little more no matter the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.330
 jam will be just as good 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.520
 we remove and now we leave it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.009
 rest while we prepare the pumpkin 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's make a mash with the pumpkin and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.390
 for that the first thing is to take away the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 seeds with the help of a spoon if 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.700
 you can find pumpkin puree and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 done perfect but you'll see it done in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.410
 house is very simple we remove all the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 seeds scraping well with the spoon and 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.700
 We cut the pumpkin into pieces as you see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 I leave the skin to me it is more 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 easy to do it like that and remove it later 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 but if you prefer, you can take the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.520
 skin before cutting it to make the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 puree we have to roast the pumpkin you can 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.429
 use it in the oven at 150 or 180 degrees 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.110
 for an hour it 's a good idea to grill 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.509
 the while preparing is another thing in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 the oven with a sponge cake a roasted chicken 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.640
 You can also roast in the microwave 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 it's much faster we put the pieces 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.110
 in a fountain and we cover them with 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 kitchen plastic to be made at 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.030
 steam we put it in the micro and cook 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.930
 at full power for about 10 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.790
 minutes here I have the roasted pumpkin and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
 still hot 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 this is important now I tell you about 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.170
 what will I use a spoon to take out 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.660
 flesh and retract the skin you see we are going to 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.670
 take the flesh of the pumpkin and put it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.310
 in the container in which we had the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.620
 gelatin resting that's why it's important 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 that the pumpkin is still hot because 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.360
 the gelatin needs heat to 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.480
 dissolve once we have the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.300
 pumpkin list we will add the envelope of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.730
 Instant tea without sugar or prepared 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.739
 of peach flavor refreshment and crush 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.170
 We have used a blender like you 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.690
 when the pumpkin was still warm 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.730
 the gelatin will dissolve itself without 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.680
 we have to heat the or what to do 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.260
 nothing grind until a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.269
 fine cream and finally we put it in a 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.070
 bottle with lid that we are going to store in 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.100
 the fridge with the cold gelatin 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.830
 kuajara giving our jam 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.410
