breeze interface once you create your
breeze<00:00:08.970> interface<00:00:09.620> you<00:00:10.620> would<00:00:11.599> want<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
breeze interface you would want to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.940 
breeze interface you would want to
upload<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> breeze<00:00:13.469> software

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
mice not connected I put in a grid the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
mice not connected I put in a grid the
grid<00:01:11.220> measurements<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you can technically see how to set it up

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
you can technically see how to set it up
you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.299> measurements<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you know on the measurements if you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.070 
you know on the measurements if you
touch<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.860> through<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> touchscreen

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
touch if you go through the touchscreen

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.660 
touch if you go through the touchscreen
section<00:01:22.080> it'll<00:01:23.070> show<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.640> are

section it'll show you that there are

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
section it'll show you that there are
parameters<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.750> where<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
parameters in there where you need to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.219 
parameters in there where you need to
enter<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.740> numbers<00:01:26.240> left<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.630> fifty

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
enter the numbers left would be fifty

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
enter the numbers left would be fifty
right<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:28.920> four<00:01:29.250> hundred<00:01:29.990> top<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.200> be

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
right would be four hundred top would be

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.230 
right would be four hundred top would be
five<00:01:31.530> fifty<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.369> bottom<00:01:32.670> would<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.850> seven

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
five fifty the bottom would be seven

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
five fifty the bottom would be seven
twenty<00:01:33.450> five<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.380> parameter

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
twenty five and this is the parameter

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
twenty five and this is the parameter
for<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.549> black<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.790> white<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.020> goes

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
for the black and white and it also goes

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
for the black and white and it also goes
on<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.110> colors<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
on the same thing for the colors and the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.850 
on the same thing for the colors and the
push<00:01:41.040> start<00:01:41.310> buttons<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> set<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
push start buttons but if you set it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.830 
push start buttons but if you set it
this<00:01:44.070> way<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> follow<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.420> numbers

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this way if you follow these numbers

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.889 
this way if you follow these numbers
basically<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.740> telling<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.310> user<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
basically it's telling your user that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
basically it's telling your user that
anywhere<00:01:48.899> inside<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.340> parameter<00:01:50.909> where

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
anywhere inside this parameter where

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.510 
anywhere inside this parameter where
they<00:01:51.299> touch<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.810> alone

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
they touch it alone

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.690 
they touch it alone
activate<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.869> command<00:01:56.530> overlays<00:01:57.700> overlays

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
activate the command overlays overlays

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.190 
activate the command overlays overlays
are<00:01:58.850> basically<00:01:59.180> templates<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.689> you<00:01:59.840> create

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
are basically templates that you create

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.980 
are basically templates that you create
this<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.310> where<00:02:01.670> your<00:02:02.330> pictures<00:02:02.780> will<00:02:02.960> be

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
this is where your pictures will be

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.670 
this is where your pictures will be
printed<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.600> transparent<00:02:06.229> section

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
printed this is the transparent section

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.770 
printed this is the transparent section
right<00:02:06.830> here<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.670> pictures<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.539> take
