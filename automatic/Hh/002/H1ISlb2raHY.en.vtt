reason<00:00:09.450> I'm<00:00:09.690> bringing<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.110> up<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.710> because

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
reason I'm bringing this up is because

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.900 
reason I'm bringing this up is because
it<00:00:12.120> has<00:00:12.290> relevance<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.769> Pokemon<00:00:14.370> oddly<00:00:14.880> enough

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it has relevance to Pokemon oddly enough

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.640 
it has relevance to Pokemon oddly enough
and<00:00:15.360> I'm<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:15.630> really<00:00:15.929> excited<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and I'm actually really excited about it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.710 
and I'm actually really excited about it
I<00:00:16.770> didn't<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.190> google<00:00:17.369> maps<00:00:17.699> prior<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
I didn't have google maps prior to this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260 
I didn't have google maps prior to this
so<00:00:18.930> i<00:00:18.960> guess<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.490> good<00:00:20.699> campaign

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so i guess it's a it's a good campaign

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.429 
so i guess it's a it's a good campaign
to<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:22.140> people<00:00:22.529> download<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.730> i<00:00:24.350> ended<00:00:25.350> up

yet so we can return to the poem on lab

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
yet so we can return to the poem on lab
and<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:25.830> cool

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and then this this is like really cool

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.690 
and then this this is like really cool
it<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
maps based on whatever and then they

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
maps based on whatever and then they
have<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.070> guessing<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.850> April

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180

of shanks love straight that's what I
was<00:02:43.180> thinking<00:02:43.450> luxray<00:02:43.930> which<00:02:44.170> actually

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
was thinking luxray which actually

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.770 
was thinking luxray which actually
apparently<00:02:44.710> saw<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.100> first<00:02:45.370> 150<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.660> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
apparently saw the first 150 so you can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.640 
apparently saw the first 150 so you can
catch<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:47.920> whoa<00:02:48.900> caught<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.440> then

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
catch it and then whoa caught and then

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.500 
catch it and then whoa caught and then
once<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> catch<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.490> then<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.150> view

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
once you catch it then you can just view

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
once you catch it then you can just view
pokedex<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.440> mean<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.250> really<00:02:54.490> simple

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
pokedex and I mean it's a really simple

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.190 
pokedex and I mean it's a really simple
thing<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.390> might<00:02:55.570> not<00:02:55.750> appeal<00:02:56.170> to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
thing and it might not appeal to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.290

appeal to everyone it's a really simple

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.320 
appeal to everyone it's a really simple
thing<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.860> probably<00:03:03.130> an<00:03:03.670> April<00:03:04.090> Fool's

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
it was really cool and i'm not sure like

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.170 
it was really cool and i'm not sure like
which<00:04:08.709> poop<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.280> side<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.580> include<00:04:09.880> into

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
which poop on this side to include into

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.300 
which poop on this side to include into
it<00:04:10.239> because<00:04:10.360> they<00:04:10.600> did<00:04:10.750> 150<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.470> I'm<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.830> assume

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
it because they did 150 so I'm I assume

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.640 
it because they did 150 so I'm I assume
those<00:04:12.550> gonna<00:04:12.730> be<00:04:12.790> like<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> first<00:04:13.300> ah<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
those gonna be like the first ah the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.760 
those gonna be like the first ah the
original<00:04:15.250> ones<00:04:15.430> but<00:04:15.700> is<00:04:15.970> not<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:17.020> obviously<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
original ones but is not so obviously I

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.390 
original ones but is not so obviously I
just<00:04:17.799> caught<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.190> joel<00:04:18.459> tank

the<00:05:10.340> fact<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.699> this<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.120> pokemon<00:05:11.510> channel

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870

the fact that this is a pokemon channel
and<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.260> could<00:05:12.530> bring<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.860> up<00:05:12.949> because<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.490> seems

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
and I could bring it up because it seems

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.339
