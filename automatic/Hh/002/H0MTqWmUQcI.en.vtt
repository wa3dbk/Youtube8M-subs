00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
to look for are these little pods here

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.100 
to look for are these little pods here
and<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:32.219> develop<00:00:33.290> after<00:00:35.090> these<00:00:36.110> flowers

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and those develop after these flowers

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.030 
and those develop after these flowers
die<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:39.420> inside<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.170> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
die like that right inside there that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
die like that right inside there that
one<00:00:41.309> oh<00:00:41.719> maybe<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:43.110> become<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> those

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
one oh maybe will become one of those

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
one oh maybe will become one of those
later<00:00:44.399> there's<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> turning

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
later there's one that's kind of turning

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.940 
later there's one that's kind of turning
brown<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> look<00:00:48.300> for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.569 
brown that's what you want to look for
and<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:52.010> pluck<00:00:53.010> them<00:00:53.129> off<00:00:53.309> like

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and you can just pluck them off like

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.529 
and you can just pluck them off like
that<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.719> save<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.239> isn't

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that and then save it this one isn't

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.889 
that and then save it this one isn't
quite<00:00:58.280> ready<00:00:59.280> yet<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.300> still<00:01:00.570> green

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

developing here's a flower that's ready

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.789 
developing here's a flower that's ready
to

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
to

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.730 
to
create<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> pod<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.469> there<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:49.860> hand

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
create a pod get in there with my hand

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.310 
create a pod get in there with my hand
but<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.310> works<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.990> every

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
but that's how it works and not every

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
but that's how it works and not every
one<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.710> wood<00:01:56.009> will<00:01:56.369> develop<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> seed

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
one of these wood will develop a seed

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.289 
one of these wood will develop a seed
pod<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.729> most<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.149> them

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
pod so you kind of go but most of them

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.950 
pod so you kind of go but most of them
most<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.869> these<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> must<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:03.840> been

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
most of these have so I must have been

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.679 
most of these have so I must have been
doing<00:02:04.110> something<00:02:04.470> right<00:02:04.679> by<00:02:04.890> watering<00:02:05.369> these
