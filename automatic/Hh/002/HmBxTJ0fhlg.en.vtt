 jean-franÃ§ois ambroise using water 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.420
 clear and live from the red sarre the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 ponds of fish farming

 of abreschviller refuel 80 tons 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.810
 rainbow trout and fario are 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.060
 produced each year on this site of the 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.800
 family of salmonids these fish 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.140
 freshwater are mainly 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 intended to feed the ponds and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.610
 rivers in Alsace and Moselle 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.410
 these trout are sold only in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 live that is to say that we deliver the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770
 fishing companies committees 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.270
 business 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 some other restorers 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.640
 fish farmers who are smaller and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.929
 who are not self-sufficient 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 mainly intended for replacement 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.929
 ponds rainbow trout 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 represents 93% of the production 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.299
 received in the form of alvin from 2 to 3 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450
 grams 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.159
 white-fleshed rainbow trouts 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 grow in these basins for ten 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.639
 to twelve months to come to a weight of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.649
 300 grams 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:30.179
 growth that requires 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.679
 very special conditions 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.420
 the sow as the lowest fish in 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.130
 one of the most fragile freshwater it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.729
 need water constantly running from 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 running water 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.329
 shred is always oxygen in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 water so that's why we have them 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.609
 machines and aerators there that gives 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.950
 oxygen 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.749
 because to a lot of tonnage qua na 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.969
 7 to 8 tons per basin so more 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.819
 fish get bigger the wind says more he 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.829
 will need oxygen with pink flesh the 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.479
 salmon trout is fashionable in the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.729
 plates of rainbow trout 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.319
 continue their growth with a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.689
 specific food 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.579
 tired of salmon so that's the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.239
 trout with pink flesh audi they go up to 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.399
 2 kg 5 3 kb from the rainbow to the base 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:10.080
 conso moniz with food like 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.220
 the flamingos spring rosa base because 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.050
 they eat pink shrimp 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.550
 it's a bit the same style it's 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.290
 the element that colors their flesh 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.659
 recognizable by its red dots 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.969
 brown trout and wild trout that 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.650
 we find in our high rivers 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.140
 in earthen ponds and trout 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.359
 are intended for the replacement of 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.980
 rivers these are the farios it's 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.329
 wild trout as they say it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.590
 takes a year longer than the arches 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.970
 heaven to have them carved like them 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.609
 are a little bit Indian eat a little less 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.629
 easily the farios are much more 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.640
 scared when all a basin project 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.750
 much wilder we put them in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 nanterre basins to prevent it 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.250
 spoils 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.720
 because if we put them in the footsteps 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.250
 are made of concrete she rubs on the edge of the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.469
 wall she spoils the fins all that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.239
 so there a natural environment for her 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.500
 it's like a mini river so they 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.030
 stay in they are much more 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.760
 beautiful much more comfortable and less 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.319
 stressed a fish stressing a fish 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.650
 who becomes sick so to avoid the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.049
 stress 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.599
 during the summer fishing ponds 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.090
 are the main clients of 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.280
 fish farming but without a few steps 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.439
 breeding ponds the pond attracts from 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000
 Many fishermen rainbow trout 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.099
 sky they are dumped daily 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.299
 but catching fish is not 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.519
 all the easier 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.720
 ah no no on the contrary it's not easy 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.209
 at all in believes that it's easy 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.919
 sir not easy he will throw 4 5 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.349
 everywhere next to you next to your 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.090
 neighbor and then hop the trout she talks 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.729
 oh you do not know where she is going to get it to you 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.739
 do not see me I have a catch of my 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.239
 neighbor and we have very little and 10 he will have 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.769
 maybe more luck than me at the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.019
 fishing i'm lucky too huh and 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.549
 then good there is also a little the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.840
 knowledge but even with the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.940
 know the trout 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.799
 if she does not want to place and between noon 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.659
 it does not bite the trout too much 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.209
 preferred to take a good sunbath 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.209
 under the incredulous eyes of the fishermen
