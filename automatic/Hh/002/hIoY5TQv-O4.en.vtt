00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
to change it I can at least reuse the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
to change it I can at least reuse the
hair<00:02:11.640> instead<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.090> purchasing<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.830> i

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.630 
hair instead of purchasing more so and i
doubt<00:02:13.980> i'll<00:02:14.459> use<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:14.940> three<00:02:15.150> bundles<00:02:15.470> so

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
doubt i'll use all three bundles so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.330 
doubt i'll use all three bundles so
majority<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:19.340> number

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
majority of it is going to be the number

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
majority of it is going to be the number
fours<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.300> got<00:02:21.450> four<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.959> not<00:02:22.080> number<00:02:22.319> teams<00:02:22.500> i

so I've already measured this mannequin

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
so I've already measured this mannequin
head<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.310> fit<00:02:32.489> my<00:02:32.700> head<00:02:32.970> I've<00:02:33.120> took<00:02:33.420> a

and make sure that I wrapped duct tape

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.520 
and make sure that I wrapped duct tape
around<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.090> until<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:46.319> reached<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> same<00:02:47.430> with

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
around it until it reached the same with

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440 
around it until it reached the same with
whoops<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.739> guess<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.220> us<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.670> whatever<00:02:51.090> just

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
able to easily oh I was mimicking really

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.059 
able to easily oh I was mimicking really
what<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> inside<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.360> week<00:03:00.390> was<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.140> what

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
what the inside of a week was like what

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.340 
what the inside of a week was like what
I've<00:03:02.160> seen<00:03:02.190> him<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.000> interior<00:03:03.299> wigs<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
I've seen him in the interior wigs so I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.110 
I've seen him in the interior wigs so I
figured<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.680> weaving<00:03:05.069> cap<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.850> would<00:03:06.090> be

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
figured a weaving cap you know would be

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.840 
figured a weaving cap you know would be
better<00:03:06.739> but<00:03:07.739> I'm<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> beginner<00:03:08.190> I've<00:03:08.519> only<00:03:08.730> ever

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
better but I'm a beginner I've only ever

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
wig and then later um what I'm not going

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.580 
wig and then later um what I'm not going
to<00:03:20.880> record<00:03:21.209> how<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.450> make<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.870> one<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.079> record

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
to record how I make this one I record

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.870 
to record how I make this one I record
this<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.980> finished<00:03:23.280> product<00:03:23.579> but<00:03:23.609> if<00:03:23.790> it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
this the finished product but if it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.050 
this the finished product but if it
turns<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:24.180> well<00:03:24.470> I'll<00:03:25.470> show<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.010> or<00:03:26.280> whatever
