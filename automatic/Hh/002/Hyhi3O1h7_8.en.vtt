00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that's why I'm doing this um pop that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
that's why I'm doing this um pop that
out<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.050> slides<00:00:31.500> backwards<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
out this then slides backwards and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880 
out this then slides backwards and
completely<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.450> tabs<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.559> probably

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
completely out of tabs will probably

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.150 
completely out of tabs will probably
break<00:00:35.040> off<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.940> old<00:00:36.239> um<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.040> then

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
break off because it's old um and then

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.190 
break off because it's old um and then
you<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.730> pop<00:00:38.969> these<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:40.140> a

you<00:01:04.739> got<00:01:04.920> another<00:01:05.580> screw<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.140> side

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you got another screw on the back side

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.370 
you got another screw on the back side
of<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.820> another<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

of it there and another one on the
bottom<00:01:10.740> okay<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> once<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.140> those

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

bottom okay so once you get those those
three<00:01:14.280> screws<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:17.220> rest<00:01:17.430> are

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
three screws out I think the rest are

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
three screws out I think the rest are
just<00:01:17.729> clips<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.220> pop<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.420> make

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
just clips that pop in and you just make

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
just clips that pop in and you just make
your<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> door

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
your way all the way around the door

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
your way all the way around the door
until<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> whole<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.720> comes<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.340> try<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
until the whole thing comes off try and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
until the whole thing comes off try and
do<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.759> even<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.150> possible<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.960> pulling

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
do it as even as possible and pulling

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.390 
do it as even as possible and pulling
straight<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.259> all<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.470> pop

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
straight out if you can all right pop

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.359 
straight out if you can all right pop
off<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> clip<00:01:32.909> underneath<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:34.040> these<00:01:35.040> three

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
off the clip underneath here these three

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.340 
off the clip underneath here these three
screws<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:36.240> come<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> these<00:01:36.810> three

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
screws will come out of these three

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.050 
screws will come out of these three
holes<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.280> sing<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.909> see

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
holes and then I have to sing off to see

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.190 
holes and then I have to sing off to see
what<00:01:42.210> happens

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.310 

seems<00:01:46.200> pretty<00:01:46.409> pretty<00:01:47.130> simple<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:48.320> right

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
seems pretty pretty simple all right

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.030 
seems pretty pretty simple all right

plugged in and then plugging my my three
plugs<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.000> into<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.240> switch<00:02:03.689> turn<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> key

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
plugs here into my switch turn the key

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.289 
plugs here into my switch turn the key
on<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.159> realized<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.210> motor<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.540> fine

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
on I realized that my motor is fine

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:23.040 

regulator<00:02:20.730> anyone<00:02:21.730> put<00:02:22.390> bolts<00:02:22.569> in

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
regulator anyone put bolts in

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.580 
regulator anyone put bolts in

so<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.130> all<00:02:27.310> those<00:02:27.519> out<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:31.450> review

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so take all those out but this review

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.550 
so take all those out but this review
this<00:02:32.739> rivet<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:34.060> rivet<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:35.349> think

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
this rivet this rivet and I think

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.559 
this rivet this rivet and I think
there's<00:02:35.709> one<00:02:35.769> over<00:02:35.980> there

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
there's one over there
