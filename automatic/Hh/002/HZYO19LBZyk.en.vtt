00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.660
 star 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.030
 for this new text from the 59hardware winery I will do 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.299
 abandon 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.299
 no 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.570
 has elicited a lot of feedback reactions at least 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.119
 three people challenged in the state through comments 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 qatar airways today offer you 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.149
 do we reproduce computer 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.210
 it is also to mark 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.099
 it is a beautiful product all aluminum and metals the main 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.230
 feature and to be endowed in fortis the actor of 25 centimeters and 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.199
 ventilation plastics which theoretically should give it 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.500
 first-rate cooling performance so here's the content 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 quite spartan from the box of evolution 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.400
 josie find 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.980
 to the heatsink as such with its fan of 25 centimeters that one 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.600
 guess behind the gate 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.180
 the fan power connector which is a simple usb cable 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.640
 small irak 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.950
 pasta that you can stick they are in pairs that you can 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.970
 stick on your laptop so that they can not on the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.050
 cooler 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.730
 that is to say the heatsink that we will find the connection 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.869
 you will find here a USB port and on which will connect 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.060
 the usb cable that will power the 25-centimeter fan here a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.609
 switch that will allow to extend the fan to pass it to two 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.030
 speeds 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.220
 and then if a switch that allows to turn on or off the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 blue wool at the fan level 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.619
 he on the product is rather very good bill 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.560
 the fan of older sister bp has a team to amplify 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920
 the different sons become 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.289
 rub against balls 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.830
 the ventilation grille 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.310
 she is very solid she does not defend herself when you press her she is fixed 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.590
 by decree without more to be glued the different parts of the minimal 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 are made of thick aluminum eight millimeters 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 % and are of good quality and the AIDS is perfect 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.460
 they are fixed by wires 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.020
 frankly not much to complain about a nice striking liquid product 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 to no one 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.509
 you must at best what I can better than its competitors 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.380
 since like us they live on their laptops several 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.929
 centimeters which makes that typing directly on the computer 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.079
 and relatively comfortable the ponies are less sure high compared to the 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.609
 elbow resulting in such a impractical position 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.919
 in any case we can not say for long minutes will now have the 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.189
 performance chapter let's start with half a hundred sound 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.489
 so here we set the fan to its maximum speed there 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.269
 turns out that the shield largely bearable ultimately it is 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.280
 lower than the maximum ventilation of the other one could already swayed on 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.279
 maxima of our laptop 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.489
 if now we adjust the ventilation 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.509
 on average speed 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.429
 I imagine that like me you do not hear much 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.889
 yet the hard drive that goes from time to time 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.919
 and who hide or try to vent 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.809
 evolve our protocol so as to do this makes other processors more 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.599
 than in our previous text 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.249
 he wants to climb up to 60 degrees painfully after two hours 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.489
 of Bern here thanks to a voltage increase an increase of 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.450
 frequency and the use of these cities he reached the 76 degrees then 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.269
 that he simply dropped on your desk 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.389
 at first we simply put your computer on 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.719
 volumes without triggering ventilation 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.189
 nothing but the fact 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.680
 to place the computer on it allowed us to gain a passing degree as well 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.760
 from 75 to 74 degrees in two hours after an hour of blindness nevertheless 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.230
 the shade is big 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.400
 a75 census and ventilation of our computer and constantly in 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.939
 market 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.029
 while 74 degrees she is not 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.179
 when you switch on the ventilation 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.970
 whether it's average speed to avoid this year 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.090
 the result is the same we gain 5 degrees compared to the temperature 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.980
 ambient when placed on the desk with a maximum temperature 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.159
 who are only 71 m away 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.539
 in conclusion we will try to refocus the debate 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.949
 firstly it is a product that costs 50 euros postage included this 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.579
 who is still the big arm trio of 2 gigas of ram that you can 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.449
 install in your computer 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.139
 secondly this personally we consider that in order to use 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.759
 such a product it is almost essential to use a set 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.050
 dedicated mouse keyboard 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.470
 so you have to have some change place one of the big plug in 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.169
 your laptop 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.909
 that being said that the product itself was very well made 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.900
 it is very well finished it is effective 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.790
 it allows us to win ten years in the meantime winter sales his role 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.550
 ventilation 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.110
 and at the same time he remained very quiet so it's clear that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.770
 if you need a rest 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.590
 and that 50 euros do not scare you you can totally consider his 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.780
 age
