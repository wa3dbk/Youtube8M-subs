form<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.110> chassis<00:01:23.470> legs<00:01:23.650> which<00:01:24.100> are<00:01:24.220> here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
form the chassis legs which are here

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.020 
form the chassis legs which are here
this<00:01:26.110> panel<00:01:26.470> here<00:01:26.770> which<00:01:26.920> has<00:01:27.340> got<00:01:27.369> no<00:01:27.700> sound

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
this panel here which has got no sound

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.380 
this panel here which has got no sound
deadening<00:01:28.210> on<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.869> from<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:29.830> backwards<00:01:30.390> it's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
deadening on it from here backwards it's

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.020 
deadening on it from here backwards it's
the<00:01:31.570> spare<00:01:31.810> wheel<00:01:31.990> well<00:01:32.710> panel<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.850> these

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the spare wheel well panel so these

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.080 
the spare wheel well panel so these
sections<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:36.250> separate<00:01:36.610> panel<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
sections here or a separate panel so the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.590 
sections here or a separate panel so the
panel<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.540> we<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.990> BMW<00:01:38.590> replace<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.600> then

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
panel that we and BMW replace and then

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.499 
panel that we and BMW replace and then
on<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:43.960> side<00:01:44.020> as<00:01:44.380> well<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:45.180> force<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.330> so

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
on this side as well the force is so

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.910 
on this side as well the force is so
great<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:47.110> pulling<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.440> spare<00:01:47.740> wheel

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
great that it's pulling the spare wheel

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.160 
great that it's pulling the spare wheel
panel<00:01:48.280> off<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.360> chassis<00:01:49.600> leg<00:01:49.869> which<00:01:50.050> is

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
panel off of the chassis leg which is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
panel off of the chassis leg which is
why<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.470> gap<00:01:50.649> has<00:01:50.830> appeared<00:01:51.100> all<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.280> way

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
why this gap has appeared all the way

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.850 
why this gap has appeared all the way
under<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.910> not<00:01:52.720> huge<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.820> enough<00:01:55.090> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
under here not huge but but enough to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.510 
under here not huge but but enough to
enough<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.009> be<00:01:57.160> visually<00:01:57.550> obvious<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.399> yeah

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
enough to be visually obvious so yeah

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.210 
enough to be visually obvious so yeah
that's<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> extent<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.300> from<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.630> inside

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that's the extent of it from the inside

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.609 
that's the extent of it from the inside
so<00:02:03.220> we're<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.340> going<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> drive<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.619> slowly

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
so we're just going to drive this slowly

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.680 
so we're just going to drive this slowly
and<00:02:05.979> private<00:02:06.729> ground<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.119> our<00:02:07.209> industrial

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
and private ground in our industrial

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.859 
and private ground in our industrial
state<00:02:07.899> now<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.349> just<00:02:09.069> simulate<00:02:09.490> some<00:02:09.869> some

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
state now and just simulate some some

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.040 
state now and just simulate some some
slow<00:02:11.819> maneuvers<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.090> see<00:02:13.569> if<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.870> video

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
slow maneuvers and see if we can video

00:02:14.050 --> 00:04:31.850 
slow maneuvers and see if we can video
the<00:02:14.920> floor<00:02:15.220> moving

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:05:21.790 

you

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:36.320 

you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.149 

so<00:05:36.870> we've<00:05:36.990> got<00:05:37.110> Lee's<00:05:37.289> car<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.830> ramp<00:05:37.979> now

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
so we've got Lee's car on the ramp now

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.240 
so we've got Lee's car on the ramp now
remove<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.849> exhausting<00:05:39.770> look<00:05:40.770> at<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.039> first

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
remove the exhausting look at the first

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.839 
remove the exhausting look at the first
points<00:05:41.699> of<00:05:42.000> damage

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
points of damage

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.189 
points of damage
this<00:05:44.849> m3<00:05:45.210> has<00:05:45.330> already<00:05:45.509> got<00:05:45.629> reinforcement

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
this m3 has already got reinforcement

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.770 
this m3 has already got reinforcement
plates<00:05:46.379> and<00:05:46.650> they've<00:05:46.770> worked<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:48.509> cracks

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
plates and they've worked the cracks

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.439 
plates and they've worked the cracks
haven't<00:05:49.159> happened<00:05:50.159> from<00:05:50.819> that<00:05:50.970> area<00:05:51.150> they've

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
haven't happened from that area they've

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.680 
haven't happened from that area they've
been<00:05:51.629> contained<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.409> issue<00:05:53.340> is<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.849> rear

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
been contained the issue is the rear

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.439 
been contained the issue is the rear
axle<00:05:55.050> carrier<00:05:55.379> panel<00:05:55.849> pulling<00:05:56.849> itself<00:05:57.150> away

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
axle carrier panel pulling itself away

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:39.950 
axle carrier panel pulling itself away
from<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:57.780> chassis

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:48.220 

and<00:06:40.470> also<00:06:40.650> on<00:06:40.800> the<00:06:40.889> right<00:06:40.949> rear<00:06:41.310> side

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.810 

so<00:06:48.740> we<00:06:48.800> just<00:06:48.950> take<00:06:49.100> the<00:06:49.160> rest<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.460> the<00:06:49.550> axle

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
so we just take the rest of the axle

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:59.820 
so we just take the rest of the axle
down<00:06:49.970> now<00:06:50.120> and<00:06:50.330> then<00:06:50.420> little<00:06:51.110> bit<00:06:51.230> closer

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.890 

you
