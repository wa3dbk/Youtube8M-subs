00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:00.989> let's<00:00:01.170> speak<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.560> little<00:00:01.709> bit<00:00:01.860> about<00:00:02.010> how

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so let's speak a little bit about how

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.450 
so let's speak a little bit about how
hard<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.210> it<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.510> compute<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.529> Nash<00:00:04.799> equilibrium

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hard is it to compute a Nash equilibrium

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.410 
hard is it to compute a Nash equilibrium

out that in practice it tends to run
very<00:02:29.140> fast<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> we've<00:02:32.590> seen<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.250> algorithm

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
very fast so we've seen the algorithm

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.490 
very fast so we've seen the algorithm
people<00:02:34.180> have<00:02:34.269> tried<00:02:34.480> very<00:02:34.720> hard<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.080> find

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
people have tried very hard to find

and<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.200> does<00:02:41.349> seem<00:02:41.590> hard<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:42.010> question<00:02:42.370> is

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
and it does seem hard the question is

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.780 
and it does seem hard the question is
can<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:42.730> somehow<00:02:43.950> capture<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.130> formally

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
can we somehow capture that formally

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.240 
can we somehow capture that formally

and<00:02:54.250> for<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.519> we<00:02:54.730> need<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.030> introduce<00:02:55.180> some

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
and for that we need to introduce some

collapse and all become one of the same
it's<00:04:12.310> why<00:04:12.519> do<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.700> believe<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.299> does<00:04:13.450> not

it's why do you believe that it does not

it's why do you believe that it does not
but<00:04:14.139> proof<00:04:14.859> doesn't<00:04:15.100> exist<00:04:16.139> however<00:04:17.139> we<00:04:17.979> do

that<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.979> hardest<00:04:44.639> among<00:04:45.000> all

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
that is it's the hardest among all

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.869 
that is it's the hardest among all

problem that class initially proved for

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.649 
problem that class initially proved for
four<00:04:48.150> players<00:04:48.620> then<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:50.039> all<00:04:50.669> four<00:04:51.300> games

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
four players then for all four games

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.170 
four players then for all four games
with<00:04:51.900> three<00:04:52.080> or<00:04:52.289> more<00:04:52.319> players<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.180> then

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
with three or more players and then

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.519 
with three or more players and then
finally<00:04:54.780> in<00:04:55.020> oh<00:04:55.800> six<00:04:56.250> for<00:04:56.969> all<00:04:57.120> class<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.349> games

finally in oh six for all class of games

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.179 
finally in oh six for all class of games
and<00:04:59.400> so<00:05:00.300> we<00:05:00.750> widely<00:05:01.560> believed<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:01.919> the

and so we widely believed that the

and so we widely believed that the
