00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
with a friend we're wondering whether

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189

this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> matter<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.140> because

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
this is going to matter at all because

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.290 
this is going to matter at all because
it<00:00:22.830> doesn't<00:00:23.160> seem<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.640> able<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> return

anything<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.340> tr6<00:00:26.340> dust<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.720> there's<00:00:27.930> no<00:00:28.369> rare

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
anything but tr6 dust so there's no rare

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.150 
anything but tr6 dust so there's no rare
chance<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.910> any<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.500> far<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.009> we
