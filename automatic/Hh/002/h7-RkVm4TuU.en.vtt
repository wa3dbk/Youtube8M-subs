including a couple mushroom biomes on

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.070 
including a couple mushroom biomes on
the<00:00:19.769> bottom<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.340> does<00:00:20.849> or<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.150> islands<00:00:21.750> so

the bottom so it does or my islands so
it<00:00:22.260> does<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.590> every<00:00:22.830> biome<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it does have every biome but just the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.150 
it does have every biome but just the
general<00:00:24.599> layout<00:00:24.929> of<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.289> map<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.560> kind<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
general layout of this map is kind of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.650 
general layout of this map is kind of
nice<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.759> it<00:00:26.910> even<00:00:27.119> follows<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
nice you can see it even follows the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.450 
nice you can see it even follows the
realistic<00:00:28.199> by<00:00:28.349> own<00:00:28.529> thing<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.099> snow

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
realistic by own thing to like snow

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.790 
realistic by own thing to like snow
doesn't<00:00:29.730> touch<00:00:29.939> desert<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:31.169> got<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.470> big

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
doesn't touch desert it's got this big

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
doesn't touch desert it's got this big
awesome<00:00:32.310> jungle<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> middle<00:00:32.880> everything

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
awesome jungle in the middle everything

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380 
awesome jungle in the middle everything
is<00:00:33.480> separated<00:00:33.990> really<00:00:34.560> nicely<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.030> what

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is separated really nicely and then what

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.300 
is separated really nicely and then what
else<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:37.020> neat<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.010> I'm

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
else is pretty neat is you can see I'm

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.620 
else is pretty neat is you can see I'm
standing<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> village<00:00:39.150> that<00:00:39.180> has<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
standing in a village that has a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.500 
standing in a village that has a
blacksmith<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.430> across<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.150> way<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
blacksmith but right across the way is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
blacksmith but right across the way is
another<00:00:43.200> village<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.830> you<00:00:43.890> could<00:00:44.040> already

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
another village and you could already

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.010 
another village and you could already
see<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> blacksmith<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.750> there

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
see that there's a blacksmith over there

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.780 
see that there's a blacksmith over there
so<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.470> leave<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.830> map<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.310> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.700> get

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
so we just leave the map out you can get

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.240 
so we just leave the map out you can get
the<00:00:47.910> other<00:00:48.030> coordinates<00:00:48.630> but<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> was

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the other coordinates but I just I was

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
the other coordinates but I just I was
amazed<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.090> happened<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
amazed that that happened I think you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
amazed that that happened I think you
don't<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.380> often<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.070> almost<00:00:53.400> close

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
don't see that often a it's almost close

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
don't see that often a it's almost close
enough<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:54.060> be<00:00:54.150> a<00:00:54.180> double<00:00:54.570> village<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.290> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
enough to be a double village which is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.800 
enough to be a double village which is
just<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.100> cool<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.480> you've<00:00:57.630> got

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
just pretty cool and then you've got

a nice little village if you look at the
map<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.969> there<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.299> another

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079

map you can see that there is another
village<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
village right over here so just like in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
village right over here so just like in
a<00:01:16.560> desert<00:01:16.859> you've<00:01:17.219> got<00:01:17.399> two<00:01:17.759> villages<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
a desert you've got two villages in the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
a desert you've got two villages in the
biome<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.079> they're<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.890> close<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.520> each

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
biome and they're really close to each

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.889 
biome and they're really close to each
other<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.030> see<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.749> again

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
other you can see you can see them again

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.719 
other you can see you can see them again
so<00:01:22.229> again<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.590> almost<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.039> double<00:01:23.369> village

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
so again it's almost a double village

so again it's almost a double village
and<00:01:23.999> it<00:01:24.570> happened<00:01:24.929> in<00:01:25.049> each<00:01:25.200> pile<00:01:25.499> you<00:01:25.799> know

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and it happened in each pile you know

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
and it happened in each pile you know
you<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> planes<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.270> we've<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you got the planes here we've got the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.989 
you got the planes here we've got the
desert<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:28.950> over<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.880> out

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
desert one right over there and look out

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.130 
desert one right over there and look out
in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.179> map<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.630> they're<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:30.899> really

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in the map you see they're all really

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130 
in the map you see they're all really
close<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.149> spot<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
