00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
journey is a little different but this

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.749 
journey is a little different but this
will<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.300> mine<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.870> pictures<00:00:13.290> from<00:00:13.519> start<00:00:14.519> to

will be mine with pictures from start to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.680 
will be mine with pictures from start to
finish<00:00:15.049> I'm<00:00:16.049> starting<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.859> photos<00:00:17.490> from

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
finish I'm starting with photos from

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
finish I'm starting with photos from
before<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.109> even<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:20.160> thinking<00:00:20.580> about

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
before I even was thinking about

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.980 
before I even was thinking about
becoming<00:00:21.240> natural

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
becoming natural

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.099 
becoming natural
I<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.740> definitely<00:00:23.300> addicted<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.810> creamy

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
I was definitely addicted to the creamy

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.380 
I was definitely addicted to the creamy
crack<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.189> mom<00:00:26.369> convinced<00:00:26.789> me<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
crack but my mom convinced me that I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
crack but my mom convinced me that I
could<00:00:27.660> transition<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.859> try<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> go<00:00:29.369> natural

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
could transition and try to go natural

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.569 
could transition and try to go natural
so<00:00:30.000> that's<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> did<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:31.430> transition<00:00:32.430> was

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so that's what I did my transition was

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.660 
so that's what I did my transition was
pretty<00:00:32.850> much<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> fail<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.190> didn't

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
pretty much a fail because I just didn't

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
pretty much a fail because I just didn't
feel<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.940> dealing<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.360> -<00:00:36.570> hair<00:00:36.809> textures

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
feel like dealing with - hair textures

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.310 
feel like dealing with - hair textures
and<00:00:37.850> eventually<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.540> nervous

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and eventually I got a little nervous

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280 
and eventually I got a little nervous
and<00:00:40.649> decided<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> cut<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.360> hair<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and decided to cut all my hair off and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.170 
and decided to cut all my hair off and
do<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> style<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:45.079> a<00:00:46.079> relaxer<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.250> these

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
do a style but with a relaxer so these

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.260 
do a style but with a relaxer so these
are<00:00:48.329> pictures<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:50.190> style<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> had

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

since<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> already<00:01:03.149> short<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:04.199> I'll<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
since is already short then I'll cut it

I was doing I did no research about what
being<00:01:18.299> natural<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.890> eventually<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
being natural was about but eventually I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.499 
being natural was about but eventually I
started<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.350> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> figure<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
started to kind of figure it out and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
started to kind of figure it out and
while<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.869> figuring<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> went<00:01:25.740> through

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
while I was figuring out I went through

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700 
while I was figuring out I went through
my<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.610> insecure<00:01:27.420> stage<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.500> one

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
my little like insecure stage of not one

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
my little like insecure stage of not one
to<00:01:28.890> take<00:01:29.070> pictures<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.970> hair<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to take pictures with my hair in it

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
to take pictures with my hair in it
because<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.770> ugly<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> thought<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because that it was ugly I thought I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
because that it was ugly I thought I
look<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> boy<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> my<00:01:34.409> pictures

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
look like a boy so a lot of my pictures

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.219 
look like a boy so a lot of my pictures
were<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.119> couldn<00:01:36.420> t<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.900> hair
