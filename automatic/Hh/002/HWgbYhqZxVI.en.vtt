 chocolate activating it's this framework 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.770
 exceptional that will allow him to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.420
 give free rein to his imagination and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.420
 to realize his most beautiful creations 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 the chocolate factory in you we have a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 handcrafted names 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.300
 industrials we use 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 mainly a lot of materials 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.930
 first of very good quality 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.390
 we also use materials 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.239
 first 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 Breton to redo out our 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.910
 very Breton identity using 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 salted butter from buckwheat pancakes 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.850
 lace the flower of salt 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.000
 we make what we call 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.910
 pralines of ganaches and one manufactures 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.769
 also caramels 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.870
 our job is to make 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.489
 assemblages a little bit like wine on 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.100
 will do assemblies of different 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.500
 raw or type of chocolate game for 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.690
 bring out the taste of henri redhead 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.690
 of our homes because at home we 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.009
 do not put dye or aroma 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:27.800
 everything is made from products 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:29.720
 natural for the realization dagana us 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.009
 let's pour the hot cream on the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 chocolate blend cover or 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.280
 cut to the neck the ghana it can be a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.600
 nature ganache with an origin of 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.750
 chocolate from venezuela sao tomÃ© brazil or 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.170
 other one can also add spices 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 make infusions of this seed 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 a lot then it'll be framed on 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.250
 tables so different thicknesses 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.640
 then we let it harden 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 ganache 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.379
 then the detail at this game the ganache 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.230
 it's a step that actually consists of 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.519
 give a shape to the candies so that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.950
 can be a quarter and it gives a 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.950
 rhombus it can be a round or blow or 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 the coating is to wrap this 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.730
 called inside the praline or 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.430
 the ganache of a chocolate couverture 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.760
 more or less thick preferably 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.129
 fine for not that it dominates the taste 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.569
 from inside chocolate candy 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:04.579
 at the end once these asphalt is finished 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.660
 by affixing a decor or making a 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.180
 decor the fork 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.940
 you can put on the praline to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.590
 the old small fines 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.989
 caramelized it's small fines 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.239
 we're going caramelized a little 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.859
 film of sugar tower to give him 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.200
 a little more crisp and 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.250
 give it a nice color or so 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.019
 can be like on noisettines 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.150
 agree the fork 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.280
 it can be with a trait of very 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:36.139
 tight very weary noisettines these two 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:38.150
 traits or decorations after it's 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.470
 according to the imagination we can not 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.360
 really varied all these sets or or and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.760
 Hello 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.620
 where then it goes into crystallization 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.110
 to harden products and after we 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.260
 can condition for it or put in 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.260
 the sale 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:20.030
 a lot a lot then chocolate 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.100

 cooking sugar to a temperature 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.840
 desired

 a base
