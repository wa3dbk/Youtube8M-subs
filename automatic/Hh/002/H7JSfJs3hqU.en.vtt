the world and this is going to be for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.429 
the world and this is going to be for
your<00:01:06.840> proof<00:01:07.520> yet<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.729> works<00:01:09.060> ok<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.049> these

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
your proof yet this works ok so these

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.300 
your proof yet this works ok so these
cactuses<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.460> put<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> all
