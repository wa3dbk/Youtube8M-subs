00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 today you do not like this dress forever 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 with the same shoes you are already 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 they walk back alone in the same locality 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 I do not know what is happening this one 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 instrument so the solution is the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.460
 Pitching pinista you'll be giving 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.460
 in this informative song 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.829
 traditionally we use our 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 Necklaces and spoons 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 to decorate the dolls of our 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 hands but I'm using it even more you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.100
 I tell how everything started 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 two years ago competing in a contest of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 modeling for a national newspaper in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 puerto rico and last minute needed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 get some golden heels in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.329
 summer season they are super 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 hard to get because they get 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.000
 mostly in the Christmas season by the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.580
 fact of the goodbye of year 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.430
 I came up with the idea of wearing necklaces 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.790
 to decorate my ankles in color 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.190
 gold and with cream-colored heels I arrived 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.010
 to think that they would notice and 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.720
 they would criticize but since I never cared 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.510
 the bad criticism of others for being 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.610
 different or some of these rare because 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.040
 I dared and I was surprised that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.380
 everyone loved it and told me 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.180
 they saw that it was necklaces from that 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.940
 then my accessories too 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 beautify my feet and I wanted to share it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.660
 with you since I know that in some 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.850
 time either for lack of time or 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.310
 money they have not been able to go out and buy 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.110
 shoes at the last moment and they have 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.330
 frustrated to find the solution that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.940
 I just showed you here I show you 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.460
 Three different styles with bracelets 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.399
 snail that you wind on your ankles with 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.800
 necklace closed and with tie-down collar and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.440
 the best thing is that you only take 5 minutes 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 change the look 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.600
 your heels decorating them with accessories 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.910
 what you most likely already have is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.700
 important that you have two accessories of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.290
 same style one for each clear foot and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.229
 I recommend you use solid colors 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.860
 to create a balance between the heel and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.860
 the accessory 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.580
 so now when you go out and buy 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.739
 accessories think about your feet because 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.840
 even if you buy two of each one, it's more 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.680
 economic than buying hundreds of shoes 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 for each one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.540
 well I hope it is sad helps 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.340
 get creative at the time you need 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.720
 change the look to your shoes or in the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.640
 if you have to combine them with 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.480
 the wardrobe you know what you can do 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.340
