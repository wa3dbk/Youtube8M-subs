 this is the reuse of bottles 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.110
 plastic in jewelery is a technique 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.910
 which is being used as an alternative 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.130
 to avoid contamination of the environment 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.630
 environment in the water museum since in 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.369
 the city of Quito is taught 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.170
 free to shape this 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.780
 material that is transformed into 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.320
 attractive ornaments 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.320
 Y 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.580
 the creativity and originality of parents 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.890
 If I find the initiative super good 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 which is used to recycle a lot and to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 do new things if the principal 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 material to be used bottles 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.040
 recycled plastic awareness in the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.640
 people care respect 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 ourselves and to the rest of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 common to the community the plastic to the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.580
 just as the panels are delayed in 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.649
 decompose 500 years polluting the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.990
 environment as an alternative in quito 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.479
 in the water museum since it was developed 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.700
 a workshop to reuse the bottles 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.289
 everything depends on the creativity of the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
 people because with a plastic bottle 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.000
 Can be done lamp can be done 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.280
 candle holder can be done as I told them 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.330
 Costume jewelery in this case bracelets earrings 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.970
 before everything said 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.800
 I could make bracelets or I'll do with 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.860
 patience and talent the plastic goes 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.640
 taking shape in a matter of minutes 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.640
 complicated that I do not see him funny and it's 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 a good way to raise awareness and see 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 that what we many people 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.290
 we think it's a waste a garbage 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.300
 then it serves to make beautiful things 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 we share with our son and we 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.650
 we teach to recycle to take care of the environment 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.900
