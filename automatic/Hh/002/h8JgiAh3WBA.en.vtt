00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:36.780
 I do not want in my destiny and well says 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:39.899
 with the tone raining waters the first time 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 that this show was made was the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.090
 invitation from the merry port on scene already 16 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.809
 years 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 We're going to Porto Alegre. 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 every time I went with friends 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 smith 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.390
 every year is a new 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 there appears the eu and zé miguel zé miguel 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 arthur is miguel with me all 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.439
 combinations had already been made 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.060
 the only one that had not been done for 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:18.380
 attempts at that trotsky in the heart 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.170
 the quiet is then a quiz bbb was not worth 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.770
 Jose is very happy andrea dovizioso 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.729
 nicky is a band that plays with it there's a 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.250
 long time already then right to a crossing 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.710
 Dedê years playing together since 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 furthermore, artur nestrovski 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.280
 playing with a gap in his band does 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.479
 classes shows with the snic then the two 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 the two are always in touch 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.909
 me and my dad had never played with 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.170
 they are not then in this project 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.899
 we had to integrate the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.640
 I was working but it was and I stayed 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.520
 in a way like her because I who 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.049
 I played with my father with the zé, it 's so certain. 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:11.209
 way this is is a unit to a 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.299
 companion to the bottom where I was going or 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.160
 she was going on a lot of looks she was 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.780
 when I went she would laugh not failed 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 repertoire of the show is very cool because 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
 all the songs are fine 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.890
 worked on this very well composed and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.400
 has just launched an argument 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 Deep down I would go to the end of the world. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.380
 a song and lyrics touching subjects is 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 unpredictable and synthesizing that much 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.600
 people feel simple sometimes 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.190
 in a complicated way but often 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.760
 in a simple light way 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.760
 of heaven may have the body but in a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.780
 song for me is very important that it is 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.660
 the song the islanders looking under a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.510
 which is the aspect of time in the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.120
 yawns and asks 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.940
 the atlantis and the queen 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.620
 it is a slow tempo song but 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.799
 at the same time it needs to maintain a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.080
 pulsation to work for her to give 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.080
 this message to the abstract part let's say 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.140
 so the message of her that does not flap 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.959
 I wrote to you, I do not know why you 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.890
 trio of effects are two songs that the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.079
 san miguel and e luís did together and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.599
 have many peculiarities in the way they 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.480
 they make the songs that zé miguel 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:49.000
 delivers the song pro luiz make the lyrics 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:52.540
 it rebounds returns such effect button 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.420
 together we will be elected are stories 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.959
 funny stories where zé miguel sends a 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.810
 music that is super beautiful melodious and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.680
 that's the one and the Luis rebate so I'm going to give 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.470
 a way to ruin this piece 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.780
 its musical beauty and bring something more 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.569
 Funny, that's what I think . 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.569
 to see behind the scenes a fan-like look 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.880
 how much does the song end since he or 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.880
 will come
