togurt<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.390> starting<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> separate<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.410> tad<00:01:14.970> I'm

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
togurt is starting to separate a tad I'm

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.609 
togurt is starting to separate a tad I'm
not<00:01:16.240> sure<00:01:16.479> if<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.720> has<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.900> huge<00:01:17.200> effect<00:01:17.320> on

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
not sure if that has a huge effect on

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.859 
not sure if that has a huge effect on
the<00:01:17.740> shoe<00:01:17.890> overall<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.299> I'm<00:01:19.390> not<00:01:19.570> sure<00:01:19.750> if

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
the shoe overall and I'm not sure if

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.350 
the shoe overall and I'm not sure if
it'll<00:01:20.020> separate<00:01:20.409> completely<00:01:20.799> but<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.060> one

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
it'll separate completely but it is one

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.130 
it'll separate completely but it is one
small<00:01:22.869> thing<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.200> I've<00:01:23.320> noticed<00:01:24.000> but

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
small thing that I've noticed but

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.440 
small thing that I've noticed but
overall<00:01:26.140> it's<00:01:26.409> pretty<00:01:26.590> comfortable<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.790> back

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.380 
overall it's pretty comfortable the back
is<00:01:29.009> firm<00:01:30.009> but<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.460> doesn't<00:01:30.729> bother<00:01:30.850> me<00:01:31.150> in<00:01:31.240> any

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.100 
is firm but it doesn't bother me in any
way<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.640> accommodates<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> wider<00:01:34.600> width<00:01:34.900> in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110

the toe box which is nice as well I also

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.789 
the toe box which is nice as well I also
like<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.310> strap<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.180> comes<00:01:40.450> over<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.960> toe

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
like this strap that comes over the toe

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.760 
like this strap that comes over the toe
box<00:01:42.009> securing<00:01:42.700> my<00:01:42.820> fore<00:01:43.119> foot<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.530> doesn't

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
box securing my fore foot so it doesn't

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.280 
box securing my fore foot so it doesn't
move<00:01:44.829> around<00:01:44.890> too<00:01:45.310> much<00:01:45.960> overall<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.079> really

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
move around too much overall I really

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.190 
move around too much overall I really
like<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.710> minimalist<00:01:48.159> feel<00:01:48.399> of<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> shoe<00:01:48.939> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
like the minimalist feel of the shoe I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.039 
like the minimalist feel of the shoe I
really<00:01:50.200> like<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.409> use<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:51.009> on<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.220> trails<00:01:51.520> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
really like to use it on the trails and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.539 
really like to use it on the trails and
I<00:01:53.049> think<00:01:53.740> I'm<00:01:53.890> gonna<00:01:54.009> try<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:56.110> newer<00:01:56.680> zero

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
I think I'm gonna try the newer zero

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.510 
I think I'm gonna try the newer zero
drop<00:01:58.090> options<00:01:58.689> as<00:01:58.840> well<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.680> think<00:02:00.009> New<00:02:00.250> Balance

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
drop options as well I think New Balance

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.270 
drop options as well I think New Balance
did<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.670> really<00:02:00.790> good<00:02:00.939> job<00:02:01.000> with<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.329> shoe
