00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
see where you know this will actually be

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.189 
see where you know this will actually be
useful<00:00:56.790> it's<00:00:57.790> basically<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.449> same<00:00:58.629> thing<00:00:58.839> as

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
useful it's basically the same thing as

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.840 
useful it's basically the same thing as
the<00:00:59.379> gamepad<00:00:59.769> minus<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.339> screen<00:01:00.640> in<00:01:00.820> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
the gamepad minus the screen in the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.829 
the gamepad minus the screen in the
middle<00:01:01.920> big<00:01:02.920> things<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.300> if<00:01:04.510> we're

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
middle big things is you know if we're

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.420 
middle big things is you know if we're
going<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:04.989> compare<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.800> original

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
going to compare this to the original

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.920 
going to compare this to the original
classic<00:01:06.909> controller<00:01:07.270> or<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.540> classic

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
classic controller or the classic

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.410 
classic controller or the classic
controller<00:01:08.200> pro<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:09.100> joysticks<00:01:09.790> click<00:01:10.180> in

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
controller pro the joysticks click in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.450 
controller pro the joysticks click in
there<00:01:11.050> not<00:01:11.260> down<00:01:11.530> here<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:12.040> more<00:01:12.190> shaped

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
there not down here it's more shaped

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.730 
there not down here it's more shaped
like<00:01:12.640> an<00:01:12.760> xbox<00:01:13.150> 360<00:01:13.750> controller<00:01:13.780> however<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
like an xbox 360 controller however the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.380 
like an xbox 360 controller however the
buttons<00:01:15.460> are<00:01:15.670> switched<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:19.120> the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
buttons are switched and that's on the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.930 
buttons are switched and that's on the
triggers<00:01:19.810> it's<00:01:20.530> actually<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:21.100> button<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.700> not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
triggers it's actually a button and not

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.150 
triggers it's actually a button and not
a<00:01:22.150> trigger<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.120> let's<00:01:25.120> compare<00:01:25.480> this<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
a trigger so let's compare this to the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.090 
a trigger so let's compare this to the
original<00:01:27.550> xbox<00:01:28.060> 360<00:01:28.600> controller<00:01:29.100> this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
original xbox 360 controller this

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.570 
original xbox 360 controller this
actually<00:01:30.670> uh<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:31.740> recharged<00:01:32.740> through<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> USB

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
actually uh is recharged through the USB

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.760 
actually uh is recharged through the USB
port<00:01:33.940> on<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.150> front<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.110> last<00:01:35.350> 80

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
port on the front and it can last 80

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.160 
port on the front and it can last 80
hours<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.370> one<00:01:36.490> charge<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.060> there's<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.480> panel

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
hours on one charge and there's a panel

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.740 
hours on one charge and there's a panel
on<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.380> back<00:01:38.700> where<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:40.030> change<00:01:40.540> the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
you would pay for this you expect

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.059 
you would pay for this you expect
something<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.569> can<00:02:10.720> recharge<00:02:11.140> without

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
having to buy a recharge kit so let's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.860 
having to buy a recharge kit so let's
compare<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.280> ps3<00:02:15.819> controller<00:02:16.150> all

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
compare it to the ps3 controller all

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.149 
compare it to the ps3 controller all
right<00:02:16.959> here<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.200> have<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.440> dualshock<00:02:17.890> 3

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
right here we have a dualshock 3

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.399 
right here we have a dualshock 3
controller<00:02:18.190> as<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.879> can<00:02:19.000> see<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:20.110> kind<00:02:20.319> of

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
controller as you can see this kind of

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.170 
controller as you can see this kind of
looks<00:02:20.650> almost<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.340> original<00:02:21.730> classic

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
looks almost like the original classic

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.699 
looks almost like the original classic
pro<00:02:22.420> controller<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.080> joysticks<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
pro controller with the joysticks on the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.729 
pro controller with the joysticks on the
bottom<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.129> these<00:02:24.340> click<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:26.530> both

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
bottom of these click in I they both

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.030 
bottom of these click in I they both
recharge<00:02:27.280> over<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.879> USB<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.989> think<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.740> Wii<00:02:29.860> U

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
recharge over the USB I think the Wii U

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.010 
recharge over the USB I think the Wii U
pro<00:02:30.069> controller<00:02:30.280> gets<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.910> longer<00:02:31.240> charge<00:02:31.540> over

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
pro controller gets a longer charge over

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.780 
pro controller gets a longer charge over
80<00:02:32.260> hours<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.770> one<00:02:32.920> charge<00:02:33.090> um

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
80 hours on one charge um

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.470 
80 hours on one charge um
so<00:02:34.909> yeah<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:36.590> comparison<00:02:37.219> and<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.519> this

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
so yeah that's comparison and that this

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.339 
so yeah that's comparison and that this
is<00:02:39.849> still<00:02:40.849> lighter<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.870> Wii<00:02:42.079> U<00:02:42.319> pro

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
is still lighter it the Wii U pro

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.020 
is still lighter it the Wii U pro
controller<00:02:42.620> feels<00:02:43.310> very<00:02:43.670> light<00:02:44.170> however<00:02:45.170> it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
controller feels very light however it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.360 
controller feels very light however it
it<00:02:47.030> feels<00:02:47.269> really<00:02:47.540> good<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:47.840> solid<00:02:48.280> however<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
it feels really good and solid however I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.550 
it feels really good and solid however I
I<00:02:49.489> don't<00:02:50.359> know<00:02:50.510> if<00:02:50.719> you<00:02:50.870> know<00:02:50.989> you're<00:02:51.379> going<00:02:51.409> to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
I don't know if you know you're going to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.559 
I don't know if you know you're going to
be<00:02:51.680> able<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.950> break<00:02:52.189> it<00:02:52.370> very<00:02:52.579> easily<00:02:52.819> probably

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
be able to break it very easily probably

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.569 
be able to break it very easily probably
but<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.870> know<00:02:53.989> Nintendo<00:02:54.500> makes<00:02:54.980> usually<00:02:55.370> good

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
but you know Nintendo makes usually good

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.250 
but you know Nintendo makes usually good
