00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
and I stream and all that stuff so I

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.699 
and I stream and all that stuff so I
just<00:02:26.790> needed<00:02:27.000> something<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.450> gps<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.590> know

just needed something for gps you know

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.339 
just needed something for gps you know
there's<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.160> good<00:02:29.370> gps<00:02:29.730> unit<00:02:30.349> it

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
there's going to be a good gps unit it

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.170 
there's going to be a good gps unit it
does<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.769> little<00:02:32.220> small<00:02:32.670> slot<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
does have a little small slot at the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.020 
does have a little small slot at the
bottom<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:33.720> right<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.400> these<00:02:35.670> it

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
bottom there right here for as these it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.979 
bottom there right here for as these it
also<00:02:36.330> has<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:37.010> i<00:02:38.010> think<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.849> mini<00:02:39.060> USB<00:02:39.239> or

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
also has a i think it's a mini USB or

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.440 
also has a i think it's a mini USB or
micro<00:02:40.290> USB<00:02:40.650> i<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:40.830> say<00:02:41.010> are<00:02:41.250> charging<00:02:42.209> port

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
micro USB i would say are charging port

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.750 
micro USB i would say are charging port
and<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.720> has<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> real<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:44.310> different

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and it has a real really different

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.710 
and it has a real really different
looking<00:02:45.030> proprietary<00:02:45.840> arm<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:47.569> guess<00:02:48.569> that's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
looking proprietary arm I guess that's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.789 
looking proprietary arm I guess that's
where<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.900> doc<00:02:49.079> goes<00:02:49.319> if<00:02:49.500> i'm<00:02:49.620> not<00:02:49.709> mistaken

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
where the doc goes if i'm not mistaken

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.300 
where the doc goes if i'm not mistaken
yeah<00:02:51.170> looks<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.470> has<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.980> button

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
yeah looks like it has like this button

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.970 
yeah looks like it has like this button
at<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> top<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:54.170> power<00:02:55.170> button<00:02:55.530> there<00:02:55.709> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
at the top there power button there I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.400 
at the top there power button there I
think<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.370> more<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.410> don't

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
think it's just more for like I don't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.190 
think it's just more for like I don't
know<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:59.280> has<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.610> compass<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.120> there<00:03:00.329> it's

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
know it has like a compass on there it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.360 
know it has like a compass on there it's
the<00:03:01.319> power<00:03:01.500> button<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.160> hand<00:03:02.280> side

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the power button on the right hand side

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.479 
the power button on the right hand side
here<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.829> think<00:03:05.040> that's<00:03:05.160> pretty<00:03:05.280> much<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
here and I think that's pretty much it

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
here and I think that's pretty much it
but<00:03:05.640> like<00:03:05.819> i<00:03:05.910> said<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.900> slim

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
but like i said it's very you know slim

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.690 
but like i said it's very you know slim
design<00:03:08.510> awesome<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.720> screen<00:03:09.930> flush<00:03:10.700> you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
design awesome like a screen flush you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.979 
design awesome like a screen flush you
know<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.000> screen<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.329> pretty<00:03:12.569> much<00:03:12.690> flush

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
know the screen is pretty much flush

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.599 
know the screen is pretty much flush
with<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.660> trimming<00:03:15.660> here<00:03:16.400> not<00:03:17.400> too<00:03:17.519> much

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
with the trimming here not too much

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.479 
with the trimming here not too much
clarity<00:03:17.880> i<00:03:17.970> think<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.269> has<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.420> little<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.019> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
clarity i think it has a little bit of a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.500 
clarity i think it has a little bit of a
cover<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.609> there<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:20.970> i'll<00:03:21.090> probably<00:03:21.299> keep

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
cover on there which i'll probably keep

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.199 
cover on there which i'll probably keep
on<00:03:21.720> until<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.019> guess<00:03:22.230> something<00:03:22.590> more<00:03:23.209> durable

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
on until I guess something more durable

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.740 
on until I guess something more durable
anyways<00:03:25.170> let's<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.650> unit<00:03:25.889> inside<00:03:26.220> their

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
anyways let's put the unit inside their

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.650 
anyways let's put the unit inside their
continued<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:27.870> unboxing<00:03:28.819> ok<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.329> here<00:03:30.599> we

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
continued with unboxing ok so here we

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.069 
continued with unboxing ok so here we
have<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.870> pretty<00:03:31.319> thick<00:03:32.209> manual<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.420> will<00:03:33.930> be

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
have a pretty thick manual I will be

those<00:04:33.560> up<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:33.950> see<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:35.000> i<00:04:35.060> believe<00:04:35.300> this<00:04:35.450> is

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
those up and see and i believe this is

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.460 
those up and see and i believe this is
the<00:04:35.950> receiver<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.840> know<00:04:38.960> receiver<00:04:39.350> and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
the receiver a you know receiver and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.469 
the receiver a you know receiver and
charger<00:04:39.860> we<00:04:40.550> see<00:04:40.729> with<00:04:40.850> your<00:04:40.940> traffic<00:04:41.180> and

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
charger we see with your traffic and

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.120 
charger we see with your traffic and
charger<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:41.990> let's<00:04:42.530> kind<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.770> put<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:42.979> together

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
charger so let's kind of put it together

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:55.870 
charger so let's kind of put it together
and<00:04:43.370> see<00:04:43.460> how<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.700> would<00:04:43.790> look<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.510> second<00:04:54.880> so

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
and see how it would look in a second so

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.510 
and see how it would look in a second so
we're<00:04:56.090> looking<00:04:56.590> charger<00:04:57.590> port<00:04:57.860> down<00:04:58.100> if<00:04:58.400> you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
we're looking charger port down if you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.010 
we're looking charger port down if you
see<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:58.970> very<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.930> very<00:05:02.990> small<00:05:05.020> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
see it it's very it's very small the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.740 
see it it's very it's very small the
next<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:09.110> looks<00:05:09.260> like<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.500> connects<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.750> hmm

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
next to it looks like it connects to hmm

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.810 
next to it looks like it connects to hmm
doesn't<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.710> connects<00:05:13.160> your<00:05:13.250> actual<00:05:13.550> unit

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
doesn't it connects your actual unit

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.469 
doesn't it connects your actual unit
looks<00:05:13.970> like<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.210> can<00:05:14.330> actually<00:05:14.690> get<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:14.900> this

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
looks like you can actually get to this

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:25.210 
looks like you can actually get to this
mount<00:05:17.479> itself<00:05:18.310> let's<00:05:19.310> open<00:05:19.520> up<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.729> note

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.230 

it's<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.370> mount<00:05:26.599> it<00:05:27.599> has<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:28.610> like<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.639> connector

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
it's the mount it has a like a connector

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.580 
it's the mount it has a like a connector
there<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:31.169> we<00:05:31.319> are<00:05:31.410> looking<00:05:31.500> for<00:05:31.830> dr.<00:05:36.199> so<00:05:37.199> it's

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.820 

looks<00:05:56.220> like<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.550> could<00:05:56.729> adjust<00:05:57.090> abou<00:05:57.740> so<00:05:58.740> you

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
looks like you could adjust abou so you

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.969 
looks like you could adjust abou so you
can<00:05:58.979> tighten<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.280> up<00:05:59.370> here<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:03.180> then<00:06:03.479> also<00:06:04.440> a

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
can tighten it up here and then also a

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.839 
can tighten it up here and then also a
section<00:06:05.580> part<00:06:05.970> shuttle<00:06:07.310> flipper<00:06:08.310> back<00:06:08.550> there

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
section part shuttle flipper back there

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.600 
section part shuttle flipper back there
and<00:06:10.370> put<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.460> together<00:06:11.610> bit<00:06:11.909> quick<00:06:13.340> slides<00:06:14.340> in

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
and put it together bit quick slides in

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.529 
and put it together bit quick slides in
this<00:06:15.330> car<00:06:15.630> slides<00:06:15.930> in<00:06:16.110> here<00:06:16.909> okay<00:06:17.909> and<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:18.419> also

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
this car slides in here okay and it also

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.779 
this car slides in here okay and it also
has<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:18.840> tiny<00:06:19.110> mechanism<00:06:19.710> back<00:06:19.860> over<00:06:20.130> here<00:06:20.340> I

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789

believe<00:06:23.789> this<00:06:23.970> just<00:06:24.210> clicks<00:06:24.990> right<00:06:25.199> into

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
believe this just clicks right into

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.800 
believe this just clicks right into
place<00:06:25.620> here<00:06:27.560> as<00:06:28.560> a<00:06:28.650> button<00:06:29.009> at<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.219> bottom<00:06:29.810> the

place here as a button at the bottom the
unit<00:06:31.250> clinicals<00:06:32.250> on<00:06:32.310> like<00:06:32.669> so<00:06:35.690> okay<00:06:36.690> that's<00:06:37.620> if

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
unit clinicals on like so okay that's if

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.939 
unit clinicals on like so okay that's if
you<00:06:37.830> want<00:06:38.009> you<00:06:38.550> know<00:06:38.639> put<00:06:38.789> on<00:06:38.909> them<00:06:39.030> on<00:06:39.539> the
