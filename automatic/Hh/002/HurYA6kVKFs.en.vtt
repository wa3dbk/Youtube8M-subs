00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.810
 good that we are again with the led 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.649
 to the moon and we're going to show you the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.870
 neck flex without brake good this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.290
 I can do it when and horse 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 it really is soft and flexible 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.850
 as I see it right now led to this not 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 fight nothing is very soft and is very 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 flexible then we can do it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.340
 teach what is this bending of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.390
 neck but without brake this so that we 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.770
 will serve us will serve us for this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.570
 Later, she can work 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.620
 completely trained with the pure 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 legs both sides as points this one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 like walking east side and good 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 we can handle anything else 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 completely with the pure legs without 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.150
 need for good brake on what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.480
 consists this consists of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 help us with a strong or with a stick 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.150
 is circling around is 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.900
 near her so she does not move in the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.360
 head to the opposite side this if 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 we started doing the small circles 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 and if he ignores this we increase the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 larger circles and if you ignore 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.140
 we touch it is to touch not nothing else 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.600
 hit him since if we hit this the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.060
 we can alter and remember that if a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.060
 Horse is disturbed, not because he does not learn 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.550
 especially in this exercise that are already 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.830
 Without delay we are completely 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.840
 relaxed 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.730
 if they are fixed right now I am indicating 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.340
 with the strong and I also support the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.980
 rein this is for you to learn this more 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.460
 fast since she knows how to flex with 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.420
 the rein then this what I do is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.020
 teach them that strong and does not 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 case this one I hold the rein and if not 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.140
 he does this, I touch it a little so that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 turn faster 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.240
 but when I keep bent and is 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.729
 the mare this I keep playing so that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 understand that the touch of the strong has 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.270
 to flip 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.620
 another thing that we have to do is 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 minimize the touch of the rein if you 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.200
 set the more the mare is advancing 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.020
 the only thing I do is lift a little 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 the right rein and with that simple touch 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.410
 and with the indication of the strong took it 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 there it doubles 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 until the time is now 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.230
 I completely loose the normal rein 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.720
 He indicated with the fort with the pure circle 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.090
 or sometimes I play it a little depending on what 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.590
 that today when the mare but is already 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.790
 understanding that at the touch of the strong 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 he has to bend his neck 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.549
 well if you notice it is completely 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.189
 loose and nothing else I occupy what is of the 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.620
 strong the indian almost not even the 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.909
 he touched and he's already flipping perfectly 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.189
 in a listener I send what is the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:56.480
 exercise this exercise we're going to 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:03:01.400
 do this 15 days this depending on 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.170
 how learning the mare is but 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.870
 with five days is enough to pass 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.510
 to the next exercise this would be the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.510
 bending the ncaa without rein 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.060
 well another thing we have to remember 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.019
 is that every exercise we teach this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.049
 previously trained horse has 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.870
 to do this excellently well with 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.900
 brake if the horse does not do it well 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.099
 with brake will not be able to do this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.599
 no train or it will be half bad 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.290
 then we want to look for this 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.150
 that they do it as well as possible and good 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.489
 this then first that they come 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.940
 with brake and then we show it to you without 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.010
 Brake 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.320
 then you have to raise awareness as 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.470
 let's use the strong and good that would be 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.470
 all
