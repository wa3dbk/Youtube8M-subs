 decline in an important way now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 no humidity in 41% the wind with 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 strong gusts of 20 kilometers from the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 this southeast and the pressure on these 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.369
 moments in 2016 millibars the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 temperature will continue to decrease as well 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.700
 is that we must take precautions not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.500
 ignoring the recommendations 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 of the different informative spaces 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.390
 that with great pleasure, well, the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.309
 we prepare for this winter storm 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.559
 the temperature is expected at 12 o'clock in the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 night between 78 degrees Celsius 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.350
 still much colder at 6 o'clock in the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 tomorrow at 12 degrees and much cooler so 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 it is but although this one was going to descend not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.219
 still much more minus a degree 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.260
 around nine o'clock in the morning 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 temperature tomorrow only 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 it is expected that well in value of the five 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 degrees centigrade you have to take many 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 vitamins this important change and so 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.300
 abrupt temperature 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 good respiratory diseases 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.410
 small ones become very vulnerable to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.270
 these temperatures the elderly 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.520
 those of us who have pets also have to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.410
 be very generous with them because good 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 it is an important part of our house 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.110
 do not get tired of giving us love like that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.540
 that we must also take care of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.430
 very important pets we have scarce 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 clouds as you want tomorrow 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.140
 expect some wind still much worse 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.690
 the temperature for this next Thursday 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.450
 temperatures that were not recorded makes 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.570
 22 years that this temperature was recorded 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.140
 so minimum freezing at -3 max all 5 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.910
 there is possibility of sleet next 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 Thursday as you want and clearing the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.290
 sky for the next minimum Friday in 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.509
 minus 2 maximum of 12 degrees 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 centigrade on Saturday it is expected that the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.770
 yet temperature is below 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.470
 the 0 degrees in the morning but already by 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 the afternoon already much better the condition of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.660
 the temperature the maximum clear sky 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 the 19 Sundays the superbowl so that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.289
 all make plans we have the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.899
 excellent sky conditions 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.130
 maximum 22 20 you are Monday 24 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.260
 Tuesday 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.300
 in the descending temperature between 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.700
 14 to 13 degrees so it will stay for the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.760
 next Wednesday we have the cold front 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.310
 number 26 of this season on the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.950
 North of Coahuila quickly 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.990
 moves towards the gulf of mexico the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.870
 continental air mass that what 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.910
 impulse is therefore good at generating 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 decrease in temperature stock 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 causing changes in the circulation of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.730
 wind and because of this entering 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 Gulf of Mexico moisture due 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.960
 also to this low pressure channel and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.600
 is what generates the winter storm 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.700
 number 3 this season what's going 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680

 degrees between 11 or 15 degrees 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.100
 there still shelter us much more dallas 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.680
