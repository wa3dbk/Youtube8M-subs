00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to start pulling lifting apart so I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.639 
to start pulling lifting apart so I
usually<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> car<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> drive<00:00:43.350> around

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the block every two to three weeks just

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
the block every two to three weeks just
to<00:00:46.050> keep<00:00:46.200> fluids<00:00:46.620> moving<00:00:46.829> through<00:00:47.129> everything

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to keep fluids moving through everything

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010
