00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
saw on YouTube I think I've learned it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.499 
saw on YouTube I think I've learned it
from<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.059> added<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.389> own

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
from that one and then I added my own

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.830 
from that one and then I added my own
twist<00:00:16.520> I'm<00:00:17.520> pretty<00:00:17.760> much<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:17.910> doing<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.449> so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
twist I'm pretty much just doing this so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.630 
twist I'm pretty much just doing this so
that<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.380> forget<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> future<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.550> can

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that if I forget in the future I can

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.140 
that if I forget in the future I can
look<00:00:21.000> back<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.949> kind<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.070> remember<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
look back on and kind of remember what I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
look back on and kind of remember what I
did<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.960> too<00:00:25.109> lazy<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.500> type<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.949> out

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
did because I'm too lazy to type it out

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
did because I'm too lazy to type it out
in<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:27.029> sort<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> music<00:00:27.599> program<00:00:30.560> see<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
in some sort of music program see how I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
in some sort of music program see how I
do<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:57.980> okay<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> eighth<00:01:01.199> fret

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
do this okay so this is the eighth fret

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
do this okay so this is the eighth fret
capo<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:03.799> think<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.100> mostly<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.430> myself

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
capo and think this is mostly for myself

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.630 
capo and think this is mostly for myself
but<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.470> will<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.770> able<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> remember<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
but like will I be able to remember that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
but like will I be able to remember that
just<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:09.570> looking<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.500> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just by looking at this I don't know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.550 
just by looking at this I don't know
maybe<00:01:11.430> I'll<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.790> play<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> slower

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
maybe I'll just play it slower

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:29.840 
maybe I'll just play it slower
okay<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> C<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.950> s

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
okay so that was basically a C like s

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.319
