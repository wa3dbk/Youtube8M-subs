see was strapped into a piece of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.320 
see was strapped into a piece of
machinery<00:02:44.070> yeah<00:02:44.340> they're<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.880> escaping

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
I think there's something about seeing a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.920 
I think there's something about seeing a
show<00:02:48.750> where<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:50.550> main<00:02:50.850> character<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> horse

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
show where the main character is a horse

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
show where the main character is a horse
and<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.100> being<00:02:53.250> played

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and it's and it's and it's being played

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.500
