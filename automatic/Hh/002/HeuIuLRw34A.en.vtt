my favorite need for speeds it does
feature<00:00:50.210> some<00:00:50.510> customization<00:00:51.170> it's<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.710> newer

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
feature some customization it's a newer

it's<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.940> newer<00:00:53.059> one<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.840> like<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.559> because<00:00:54.679> they

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's a newer one I like it because they

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.930 
it's a newer one I like it because they
added<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> customization<00:00:56.329> again<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:58.190> some<00:00:58.820> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
added the customization again in some of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360 
added the customization again in some of
the<00:00:59.120> previous<00:00:59.449> need<00:00:59.840> for<00:00:59.989> speeds<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
the previous need for speeds and the the

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.200 
the previous need for speeds and the the
latter<00:01:01.760> ones<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.600> later<00:01:02.780> ones<00:01:03.070> they<00:01:04.070> took<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
latter ones the later ones they took the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.950 
latter ones the later ones they took the
custom<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.170> customization<00:01:07.690> out<00:01:08.690> of<00:01:08.900> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
custom is a the customization out of the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.860 
custom is a the customization out of the
picture<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:10.640> could<00:01:11.120> pretty<00:01:11.450> much<00:01:11.540> only

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
picture so you could pretty much only

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.399 
picture so you could pretty much only
race<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:12.290> stock<00:01:12.530> cars<00:01:13.060> but<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.900> run<00:01:15.140> they

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
race with stock cars but in the run they

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.130 
race with stock cars but in the run they
kind<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:15.950> added<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.700> pretty<00:01:17.420> much<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.750> um

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
kind of added it and pretty much and um

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.219 
kind of added it and pretty much and um
once<00:01:18.950> f<00:01:19.400> again<00:01:20.060> after<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.979> think<00:01:22.450> about<00:01:23.450> six<00:01:24.049> or

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
once f again after I think about six or

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.340 
once f again after I think about six or
seven<00:01:24.409> parts<00:01:25.540> they<00:01:26.540> added<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.680> story<00:01:28.100> again<00:01:28.460> um

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
seven parts they added a story again um

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.240 
seven parts they added a story again um
it's<00:01:30.350> pretty<00:01:30.560> much<00:01:31.840> about<00:01:32.840> getting<00:01:33.290> out<00:01:33.860> of

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
it's pretty much about getting out of

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.109 
it's pretty much about getting out of
out<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.240> San<00:01:35.570> Francisco<00:01:36.049> I<00:01:36.079> think<00:01:36.820> well<00:01:37.820> yeah

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
out of San Francisco I think well yeah

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.760 
out of San Francisco I think well yeah
as<00:01:38.420> far<00:01:38.659> as<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.869> gameplay<00:01:39.170> goes<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.649> a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
as far as the gameplay goes it's a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.090 
as far as the gameplay goes it's a
racing<00:01:39.950> game<00:01:40.869> with<00:01:41.869> little<00:01:42.439> loads<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.860> cars

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
racing game with little loads of cars

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.190 
racing game with little loads of cars
and<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.420> again<00:01:44.899> new<00:01:45.110> tracks<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.810> well<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.049> i'm

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
and and again new tracks and well if i'm

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.850 
and and again new tracks and well if i'm
not<00:01:48.290> mistaken<00:01:48.880> shitloads<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:51.290> opponents

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
not mistaken shitloads of the opponents

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.249 
not mistaken shitloads of the opponents
that<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> have<00:01:52.219> to<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:53.180> overtake<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.700> get<00:01:55.700> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
that you have to to overtake and get to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.740 
that you have to to overtake and get to
get<00:01:57.259> in<00:01:57.350> front<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.729> run<00:01:58.969> is<00:01:59.149> basically

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
get in front of the run is basically

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.709 
get in front of the run is basically
composed<00:02:00.049> pretty<00:02:00.560> much<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:01.460> time<00:02:02.119> attacks<00:02:02.479> and

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
composed pretty much of time attacks and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.170 
composed pretty much of time attacks and
overtake<00:02:03.229> races<00:02:03.649> that's<00:02:04.280> pretty<00:02:04.460> much<00:02:04.579> the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
overtake races that's pretty much the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.999 
overtake races that's pretty much the
two<00:02:05.750> types<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.140> races<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.619> you're<00:02:06.799> mostly

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
two types of races that you're mostly

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.350 
two types of races that you're mostly
going<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.219> get<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.720> game<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.090> there

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
going to get in the game they and there

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.620 
going to get in the game they and there
aren't<00:02:11.570> classic<00:02:12.080> circuits<00:02:12.530> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
aren't classic circuits and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.540

have<00:02:27.730> been<00:02:28.000> even<00:02:28.510> improved<00:02:29.380> even<00:02:29.560> further

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
have been even improved even further

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.140 
have been even improved even further
they're<00:02:30.370> quite<00:02:30.640> good<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.280> highest

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
they're quite good and on on the highest

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
from before so yeah in my opinion the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.080 
from before so yeah in my opinion the
game<00:03:11.320> itself<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.550> great<00:03:13.440> pretty<00:03:14.440> much<00:03:15.090> because

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
game itself is great pretty much because

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.880 
game itself is great pretty much because
of<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.270> gameplay<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.200> graphics<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.740> the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
of the gameplay and the graphics and the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.820 
of the gameplay and the graphics and the
the<00:03:18.340> effect<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.700> they<00:03:18.940> had<00:03:19.090> at<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:20.500> kind

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
the effect that they had at it it's kind

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.080 
the effect that they had at it it's kind
of<00:03:20.890> like<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.220> were<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.460> a<00:03:21.520> Michael<00:03:21.910> Bay<00:03:22.060> movie

of like you were in a Michael Bay movie
here<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.620> yeah<00:03:23.860> we'll<00:03:24.520> leave<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.910> later

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090
