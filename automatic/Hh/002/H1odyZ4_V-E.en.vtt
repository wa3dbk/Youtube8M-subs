originally<00:02:35.520> came<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.210> pmags<00:02:36.830> but

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
originally came with the the pmags but

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.290 
originally came with the the pmags but
it's<00:02:37.950> kind<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> broken<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.970> don't<00:02:39.120> know<00:02:39.210> if

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
it's kind of broken so I don't know if

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's kind of broken so I don't know if
you<00:02:39.390> want<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:39.990> have<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:41.240> kwa<00:02:42.240> k120<00:02:43.050> mag

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
you want that then I have a kwa k120 mag

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.860 
you want that then I have a kwa k120 mag
which<00:02:44.070> works<00:02:44.340> too

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
which works too

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.930 
which works too
I<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.620> four<00:02:46.920> more<00:02:47.100> Elite<00:02:47.340> Force<00:02:47.610> mags

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
I have like four more Elite Force mags

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.140 
I have like four more Elite Force mags
so<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.630> I'll<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.080> like<00:02:49.290> thirteen<00:02:50.190> so

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
so I think I'll make like thirteen so

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.490 
so I think I'll make like thirteen so
I'll<00:02:51.540> include<00:02:51.690> those<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:54.959> moving<00:02:55.200> over

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I'll include those and then moving over

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.470 
I'll include those and then moving over
here<00:02:55.530> ice<00:02:55.770> since<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.580> guns<00:02:56.760> only<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> few<00:02:57.300> weeks

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
here ice since the guns only a few weeks

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.890 
here ice since the guns only a few weeks
old<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.930> should<00:02:58.140> say<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.470> engine<00:02:59.690> let's<00:03:00.690> say

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
old or I should say the engine let's say

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.190 
old or I should say the engine let's say
I<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.440> box<00:03:01.680> I'll<00:03:02.160> still<00:03:02.520> have<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
I have the box I'll still have the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.330 
I have the box I'll still have the
manual<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.350> stuff<00:03:05.720> FCU<00:03:06.720> sticker<00:03:07.170> here's<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
manual and stuff FCU sticker here's the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.800 
manual and stuff FCU sticker here's the
original<00:03:08.959> gearbox<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.890> GMP<00:03:11.810> there's

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
original gearbox for the GMP there's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.000 
original gearbox for the GMP there's
probably<00:03:13.050> only<00:03:13.170> literally<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.709> two<00:03:13.920> hundred

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
probably only literally like two hundred

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
probably only literally like two hundred
rounds<00:03:14.459> through<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.760> thing<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.300> like

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
rounds through this thing it's like

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.860 
rounds through this thing it's like
brand-new<00:03:16.530> um<00:03:17.100> I'll<00:03:18.060> probably<00:03:18.269> include<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
brand-new um I'll probably include that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.020 
brand-new um I'll probably include that
too<00:03:19.110> because<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.799> told<00:03:20.370> myself<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.880> would<00:03:20.970> never

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
too because I told myself I would never

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.250 
too because I told myself I would never
go<00:03:21.299> back<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.660> AEG<00:03:22.410> platform<00:03:24.110> because<00:03:25.110> yeah

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
go back to the AEG platform because yeah

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.320 
go back to the AEG platform because yeah
I'm<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.530> completely<00:03:25.890> done<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.519> got<00:03:26.700> via<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
I'm just completely done and I got via a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.440 
I'm just completely done and I got via a
motor<00:03:28.049> young<00:03:29.180> gmpm<00:03:30.180> 120<00:03:30.720> um<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:32.340> also<00:03:33.120> took<00:03:33.299> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
motor young gmpm 120 um I also took the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.120 
motor young gmpm 120 um I also took the
dust<00:03:33.810> cover<00:03:34.110> out<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.780> PolarStar<00:03:36.890> or<00:03:37.890> on

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
dust cover out of the PolarStar or on

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.949 
dust cover out of the PolarStar or on
the<00:03:38.250> side<00:03:38.459> because<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.910> was<00:03:39.239> bugging<00:03:39.720> me<00:03:39.780> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the side because it was bugging me is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.500 
the side because it was bugging me is
just<00:03:40.110> being<00:03:40.799> stupid<00:03:41.100> but<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.640> does<00:03:41.910> work<00:03:42.239> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
just being stupid but it does work I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.539 
just being stupid but it does work I
just<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.500> didn't<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.310> just

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
just I just didn't like it so I just

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.430 
just I just didn't like it so I just
took<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.850> out<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.600> could<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.780> installed

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
took it out but that could be installed

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.229 
took it out but that could be installed
back<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.860> um<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:49.140> yeah<00:03:49.500> I'll<00:03:49.970> hook<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.030> up

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
back in um but yeah I'll hook it up

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.050 
back in um but yeah I'll hook it up
really<00:03:51.480> quick<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.130> do<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.160> quick<00:03:53.519> little

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.900 

all<00:04:08.390> right<00:04:08.600> so<00:04:08.870> um<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:09.830> regulator<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.520> have<00:04:10.760> it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
all right so um my regulator I have it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.940 
all right so um my regulator I have it
set<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.410> little<00:04:12.410> under<00:04:12.800> 80<00:04:13.520> psi<00:04:14.920> which<00:04:15.920> is

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
set to a little under 80 psi which is

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.420 
set to a little under 80 psi which is
great<00:04:16.340> because<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:17.750> play<00:04:18.290> CQB<00:04:18.830> so<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.280> about

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
great because I play CQB so I get about

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.670 
great because I play CQB so I get about
three<00:04:19.730> thirty<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.180> three<00:04:20.330> 40<00:04:20.720> FPS<00:04:21.140> off<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.590> this

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
three thirty to three 40 FPS off of this

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.580 
three thirty to three 40 FPS off of this
gun<00:04:24.130> but<00:04:25.130> yeah<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.240> yeah<00:04:26.450> I'll<00:04:26.900> do<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> few

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590

gun but yeah and yeah I'll do a few
rounds<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:28.130> them<00:04:29.050> semi<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:30.290> I'll<00:04:30.380> go<00:04:30.560> full

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
rounds on them semi then I'll go full

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:42.520 
rounds on them semi then I'll go full
auto<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:33.310> okay<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.870> said<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.230> set<00:04:42.410> to

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
auto so okay so like I said it's set to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.050 
auto so okay so like I said it's set to
about<00:04:42.620> thirty<00:04:43.040> rounds<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.430> second<00:04:43.850> but<00:04:44.030> that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
about thirty rounds a second but that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:57.610 
about thirty rounds a second but that
can<00:04:44.390> be<00:04:44.420> changed<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.840> then<00:04:54.020> safe<00:04:54.410> works<00:04:56.620> so

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
can be changed and then safe works so

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.930 
can be changed and then safe works so
yeah<00:04:59.050> the<00:05:00.050> trigger<00:05:00.410> is<00:05:00.650> about<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.520> same<00:05:01.760> as<00:05:01.790> a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
yeah the trigger is about the same as a

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.850 
yeah the trigger is about the same as a
PTW<00:05:03.670> yeah<00:05:04.670> I<00:05:04.700> haven't<00:05:05.030> shot<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.180> PTW<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:06.050> they're

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
PTW yeah I haven't shot a PTW so they're

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.950 
PTW yeah I haven't shot a PTW so they're
about<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.190> same<00:05:08.740> but<00:05:09.760> yeah<00:05:10.760> that's<00:05:11.000> that's

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
about the same but yeah that's that's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.830 
about the same but yeah that's that's
about<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.620> mean<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:16.520> yeah<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:17.690> comes

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
about it I mean so yeah and it comes

with the obviously it comes with the
tank<00:05:19.820> in<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.240> UM<00:05:20.650> regulator<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:21.980> hose

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
tank in the UM regulator and the hose

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.680 
tank in the UM regulator and the hose
which<00:05:23.360> is<00:05:23.480> also<00:05:23.660> brand-new<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:25.510> that's<00:05:26.510> about
