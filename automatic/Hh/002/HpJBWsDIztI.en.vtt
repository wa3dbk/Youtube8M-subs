00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hi everyone, who is this teacher? 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
 raquel in the footsteps of the disciplines of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.320
 integrated clinical dentistry of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.420
 Catholic University of Brasilia 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.059
 today we will treat a little bit about 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.190
 the polymerization reaction which is a 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 process involved in most of the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.609
 procedures performed with materials 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 resin for direct use in dentistry 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.199
 as discussed in the previous video 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 Composite resins have a matrix 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.210
 basically formed by 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.000
 monomers which are the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 structural properties of the substance during 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.790
 Polymerization occurs the chemical bond 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 of these monomers in polymers hence the name 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.360
 This process can be 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.340
 three physical chemical types or al 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 in the case of chemical pollination is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 necessary that the accelerator and the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.359
 initiator are made available 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.789
 packaging in such a way that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.680
 reaction only begins at the moment when the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.680
 folders are mixed 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.049
 already in the case of physical pollination is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.840
 necessary physical stimulation in general in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.189
 wavelength light shape 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 which will trigger a 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.610
 the reaction of monomer 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.049
 long polymer chains in the case of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 Pollination al 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.759
 the reaction is activated in both ways so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.820
 as the polymerization materials 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.520
 chemistry when mixing folders starts 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 a chemical reaction and the presence of a photo 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.829
 initiators will allow the activation 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 physical reaction to accelerate it 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.720
 this scheme of the teacher's book 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.869
 baratieri 2010 well summarizes the mechanism 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 Basic pollination of composites 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.799
 a slight extinction in the process 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.159
 depending on the type of polymerization 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.570
 be it physical or chemical Dual 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.610
 first phase 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 it begins with the breaking of molecules 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.009
 initiator per activator action 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.110
 generating free radicals and the presence 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.390
 these free radicals will start the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.849
 propagation where a reaction occurs in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.890
 the double bond breaking chain of the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.260
 monomers at the time 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.840
 the double action is broken the number then 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 activated and acts as a new 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.120
 free radical, causing the reaction to 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.330
 progress until two active molecules 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.890
 if one does not close the polymer chain 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.680
 which characterizes the termination of the reaction 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.360
 of polymerization it is characterized 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.880
 by the approximation of the molecules of 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.970
 monomer represented here by the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.350
 resulting in a reduction in the volume of 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 material 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.600
 this phenomenon is known as contraction 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 polymerization and has a direct relationship 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.610
 with the amount of organic matrix of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.650
 Composites ie the higher the volume 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.989
 of the matrix greater the contraction of 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.630
 polymerization it turns 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.170
 already in the compounds based on metal 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.170
 acrylate which are the great majority is this 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.269
 The polymerization contraction varies from 2 to 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.820
 6 percent by volume while 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.380
 carrot-based compound year is lower 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.590
 than 1% 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 the contraction degrees is also influenced 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.790
 by the compliance of the molecules of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.070
 monomer being the matrices 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.920
 composed of smaller chains and more 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.739
 simple suffer more with traction when 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.670
 to bind to polymers than the more 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.100
 molecules with high molecular weight in the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.560
 However, the production of 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.380
 containing exclusively monomers of 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.049
 high molecular weight is not feasible once 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.079
 that after the addition of the load the materials 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.000
 would be too rigid for clinical use and 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.950
 to work around this problem use 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.920
 high and low molecular weight monomer 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.329
 in the same material 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.320
 another aspect that directly influences 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.299
 in the hiring of pollination is the volume 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.420
 of the load incorporated into the organic matrix 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.440
 ie the higher the volume of the load 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.430
 smaller than the matrix and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.359
 consequently lower contraction 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.030
 with the contraction of 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.549
 polymerization and consequent reduction of 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.380
 volume of the material are generated voltages 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.380
 at the interface between the compounds and 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.990
 substrate details when the forces of 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.360
 contraction stress are higher than the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.879
 adhesive resistance can be created 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.129
 then a space that can generate 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.199
 undesirable clinical consequences such as 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.289
 marginal infiltration 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.770
 marginal and secondary and rupture of 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.930
 adherence in situations where stress is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.479
 high but insufficient to break the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.729
 adhesive bonding forces can be 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.939
 transmitted to the remnant causing 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.349
 problems such as cost 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.650
 postoperative sensitivity or even 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.849
 even cracks in the peripheral enamel 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.319
 especially in cases where there is little 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.509
 support to teach you 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.909
 among the factors that influence 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.860
 are the volume of polymerization 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.620
 of the material being polymerized 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.550
 the mechanical properties of the physical 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.430
 material 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.699
 the polymerization technique used and the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.550
 technique of inserting the increments in 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.340
 simple terms the higher the volume 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.789
 of material being polymerized higher 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.610
 stress polymerization with the 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.069
 elasticity refers to the rigidity of the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.289
 the larger the 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.620
 greater elasticity the stress of 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.719
 as to the polymerization technique 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.479
 insertion of increments is important 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:42.120
 to discuss the factor being the factor of 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.889
 configuration with victory and can be 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.830
 understood as the ratio of the number 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.050
 of areas acquired by the number of 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.500
 existing free surfaces of a 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.469
 cavity for example a cavity as 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.839
 class or cross the factor c is 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.870
 equal to 5 since there are five 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:03.659
 walls avenues vestibular tongue months 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.900
 the audi is a pool pa and only one 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.629
 free wall that uc rusal this in case 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.439
 of a single increment and the 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:15.810
 direct polymerization in order to have 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.729
 a better relationship between the number of 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.219
 surfaces and free area 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.069
 diverse techniques of 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.529
 incremental insertion of these composites 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.839
 techniques help both to reduce the 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.930
 factor c while ensuring a better 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:33.089
 organization of composite resin 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.669
 by placing smaller portions of the resin and 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.990
 making the light to your 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:40.110
 adequately at each increment 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.420
 Ideally, each increment should have up to 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.220
 of 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.890
 millimeters thick then doubt whether
