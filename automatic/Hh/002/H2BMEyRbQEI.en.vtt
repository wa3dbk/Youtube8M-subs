 cookies for the cake we are going to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.370

 teaspoon and a half of baking powder 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 120 milliliters of semi-skimmed milk 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.320
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.230
 and a good handful of chocolate drops 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.199
 for the filling we need 150 grams 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 of brown sugar 125 milliliters of milk 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.620
 90 grams of flour 125 grams of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.720
 butter 2 tablespoons drops 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 chocolate and a teaspoon of extract 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
 of vanilla and for the battery and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 we need 250 grams of butter 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.970
 sauce 250 grams of icing sugar and 2 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.330
 teaspoons of vanilla thistles 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.449
 we start by throwing the butter with the 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.449
 sugar 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.010
 we beat the butter with the sugar 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.550
 until they integrate well and the mixture 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.550
 be clear 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.840
 let's beat at low speed 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.270
 then we add the eggs one by one 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.270
 beating well until it is incorporated 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.760
 once the eggs are incorporated 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.730
 add half the flour 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.280
 and we beat it at low speed 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.420
 the flour is previously sieved 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.420
 with the yeast 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.340
 next we are going to add the milk 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.280
 which is mixed with the extract of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.090
 vanilla 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.590
 and now we are going to throw out the flour that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.590
 we are left in the bowl 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.950
 and we mix everything well until we 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.930
 there is a homogeneous mass once 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 let's have the mass ready let's 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.729
 incorporate the chocolate drops 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.099
 we're going to pass them first a little bit 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.220
 flour to try not to get off 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.260
 a lot of cooking 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200
 we are going to distribute the mixture of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.740
 capsules filling them in half and the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.000
 let's bake for 20 22 minutes in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.040
 the oven preheated to 180 degrees a 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 they are ready 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.769
 we leave them as always first cool 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.790
 5 minutes in the tray and then the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.799
 let cool everything in the grid 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.640
 now let's make the cream let's 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.890
 put to heat the milk and we're going 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.140
 adding the sugar stirring very well 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.799
 so you do not stop 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.799
 dissolving 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.620
 We are going to heat it little by little until 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.570
 milk starts to boil when 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.630
 start to boil at that time we are going to 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.940
 add the flour 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.010
 and we remove it well we hope some 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.100
 more seconds and then we remove it from 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100
 fire 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.520
 and we add the vanilla extract 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 we mix it very well until the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.549
 mixture is completely homogeneous then what 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.640
 let's leave to temper a bit and a 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.430
 Once tempered with not burning 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.110
 we will incorporate the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.090
 butter that we are going to remove 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.940
 energetically so that it falls apart and 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.829
 well until we have a dense mass 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.900
 then what we are going to do is add the 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:46.769
 a few drops of chocolate 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.360
 once we have the cream ready and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.080
 what we're going to do is like a cold 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.780
 discouraging we are going to take him 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.530
 a little bit in the center of our 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.410
 cupcakes 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.880
 and we are going to keep the piece that we have 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.880
 removed to later cover 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.140
 how we put the cream in a sleeve 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.270
 pastry 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.630
 we cut a little bit from the tip 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.570
 we do not even need to put a 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.870
 nozzle and we're going to fill in our 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.870
 egg 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.430
 and when it's filled out we're going to put 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.280
 another a little bit the piece that we had 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.229
 removed to cover over does not matter 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.840
 if not if it does not come out on the outside 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.949
 little bit because if you are then 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.740
 everything as with the battle cream and while 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.129
 now let's make the crime toilet 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.139
 let's add 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.139
 sugar butter 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.390
 the vanilla extract 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.180
 we started beating at slow speed and 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.990
 then we go up at speed 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.950
 medium high like this for at least 5 minutes 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.440
 once from our toilet that is ready 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.770
 we are going to take our cupcakes and 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.830
 let's put a little 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.139
 of the cream above this you can 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.169
 do so or perfectly you can 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.599
 leave without putting on the cream because 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.530
 decorating them will fit us perfectly 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.629
 just fine that's just in case you have left 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.560
 some little hole that looks like that is 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.560
 task is the fault 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.170
 and now let's fill the sleeve 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.170
 pastry with cream 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.599
 and we started decorating them, we're going to use the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.129
 technique we start in the middle we look 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.979
 a little bit upwards of swears and 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.490
 we turn in the direction of the needles of the 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.819
 clock and at the end we let respect and 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.819
 we throw 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.409
 and now what we are going to do is with a 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.259
 tiny cookie of these chips ahoy 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:11.439
 and we put it on and we have our 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.439
 cookie cupcake ready
