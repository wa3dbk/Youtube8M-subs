in the future so oh it comes in blue and
orange<00:00:20.480> pink<00:00:21.169> red<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.679> black<00:00:22.400> it's<00:00:23.269> a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
orange pink red and black it's a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.149 
orange pink red and black it's a
two-piece<00:00:23.779> case<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:24.439> I'm<00:00:24.619> going<00:00:24.829> to<00:00:24.859> take<00:00:25.039> it

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159 
two-piece case so I'm going to take it

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.849 
two-piece case so I'm going to take it
apart<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.579> show<00:00:25.669> you<00:00:26.199> what<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:27.289> looks<00:00:27.319> like<00:00:29.859> so

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
apart and show you what it looks like so

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.590 
apart and show you what it looks like so
you<00:00:31.310> just<00:00:31.339> pop<00:00:31.819> it<00:00:32.029> out<00:00:32.530> to<00:00:33.530> reveal<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.000> two

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
you just pop it out to reveal the two

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:44.919 
you just pop it out to reveal the two
layers<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:41.600> here<00:00:41.840> I<00:00:41.870> have<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:42.379> TPU<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.850> it's<00:00:44.780> not

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
layers so here I have a TPU and it's not

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.040 
layers so here I have a TPU and it's not
silicone<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:45.829> it's<00:00:46.190> not<00:00:46.820> as<00:00:47.000> bendy<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:47.570> silicon

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
silicone so it's not as bendy as silicon

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.329 
silicone so it's not as bendy as silicon
but<00:00:48.379> because<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.190> its<00:00:49.339> a<00:00:50.140> texture<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.410> isn't

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
but because of its a texture it isn't

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.220 
but because of its a texture it isn't
going<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.550> attract<00:00:53.059> dust<00:00:53.329> as<00:00:53.570> easily<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.170> you

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
going to attract dust as easily so you

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.040 
going to attract dust as easily so you
can<00:00:54.410> keep<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.679> clean<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:56.420> second<00:00:56.870> layer

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
can keep it clean and the second layer

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.880 
can keep it clean and the second layer
is<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.320> hard<00:00:58.129> shell<00:00:58.370> poly<00:00:58.850> carbonate<00:00:59.469> so<00:01:00.469> let<00:01:00.769> me

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
is a hard shell poly carbonate so let me

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.470 
is a hard shell poly carbonate so let me
show<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.339> what<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:01.820> looks<00:01:01.850> like<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.420> the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
covered and so are the volume controls

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.010 
covered and so are the volume controls
but<00:01:28.070> they're<00:01:28.280> very<00:01:28.310> easily<00:01:28.760> once<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> press

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
the second layer it's the hard shell so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.100 
the second layer it's the hard shell so
I'm<00:01:35.900> going<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.110> put<00:01:36.980> it<00:01:37.070> on<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:38.510> you<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.870> it

I'm going to put it on and you just it
just<00:01:39.230> snaps<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.800> very<00:01:40.130> easily<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:41.500> you'll<00:01:42.500> see

just snaps on very easily and you'll see
that<00:01:42.800> all<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.790> corners<00:01:44.510> are<00:01:44.840> covered<00:01:45.770> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
that all the corners are covered and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.240 
that all the corners are covered and
these<00:01:46.460> are<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.760> main<00:01:47.410> parts<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.650> get<00:01:48.980> hit

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
these are the main parts that get hit

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.600 
these are the main parts that get hit
whenever<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.820> drop<00:01:50.120> your<00:01:50.390> phone<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.370> can

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
whenever you drop your phone so you can

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.370 
whenever you drop your phone so you can
rest<00:01:52.820> assured<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.210> they'll<00:01:53.570> be<00:01:53.720> protected

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
rest assured that they'll be protected

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.310 
rest assured that they'll be protected
and<00:01:55.300> speaking<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.360> dropping<00:01:56.810> you're<00:01:57.020> less

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and speaking of dropping you're less

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.930 
and speaking of dropping you're less
likely<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.770> actually<00:01:58.010> drop<00:01:58.490> your<00:01:58.700> phone

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
likely to actually drop your phone

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.180 
likely to actually drop your phone
because<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.690> texture<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.800> back<00:02:00.980> of

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
because of the texture of the back of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.370 
because of the texture of the back of
the<00:02:01.310> phone<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.300> gives<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.630> nice<00:02:02.840> grip<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
the phone so it gives you a nice grip in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
the phone so it gives you a nice grip in
your<00:02:03.500> hand<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.700> actually<00:02:04.850> hard<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.300> drop

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
your hand so it's actually hard to drop

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.919 
your hand so it's actually hard to drop
it<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.670> another<00:02:07.670> cool<00:02:08.000> feature<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.599> case

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
it and another cool feature of this case

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.100 
it and another cool feature of this case
is<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.700> kickstand<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.080> just

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
is that we have a kickstand so it just

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.190 
is that we have a kickstand so it just
slides<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:12.980> pops<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.670> then

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
slides out and pops and then

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.920 
slides out and pops and then
your<00:02:14.830> phone<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.550> turned<00:02:15.910> into<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.330> viewing
