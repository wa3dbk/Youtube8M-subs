00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 rover hours 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.960
 catch the ball in the throat 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.699
 it has a minimum weight of 420 for years 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.390
 it is a diameter of 20 centimeters the handle of the ball must take place 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.850
 resting on the fingers on the palm on the fingers of the hand and does not have to be 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 carried out in a signed manner withholding strength 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.320
 technical movements of the palm are the oscillations 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 Circles 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 movements at 8 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 the dribbles 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 I have complaints 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.840
 in unstable equilibrium 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.440
 in travel 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.310
 launch from the infinite oscillation 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760
 download free 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.130
 launch from the thrust window 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.950
 always for lovers 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950
 ground shooting out of sight 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 water recovery from the field. 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.290
 throughout the body, the market area of ​​the ball is all the capitals 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 last update love and no greater breadth of all format 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.549
 d amplitude must be well defined welcome to the continuous world 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.880
 discussion think with unstable ball balance 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.010
 made by mata when it comes out of conduction 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.089
 d2 series all the rest and holidays 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.099
 these with passage from one form to another with free movement of the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.820
 leg 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.820
 with trunk rotation 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.909
 finally yesterday 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.099
 during the butterfly flight 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.099
 2 counterbalances must be performed 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.789
 and after loss of contact 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.459
 immediately at the end of the second rotation I also hate the second installment 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.849
 the cagliari alternative will try correctly
