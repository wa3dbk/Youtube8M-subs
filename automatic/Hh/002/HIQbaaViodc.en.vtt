00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 so my love on we go with today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 a slightly different video not with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.309
 some series but today times with 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 a very solid game and against 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.740
 the julian of fifa boss united julian 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 here and not quite today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 The game will not succeed for you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 See in the background that is three 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.029
 players in this somewhat weird 11 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 somehow still missing and indeed 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 we have on the channel of diversity 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 united einbeck opening recorded with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 the three 100 set and in each case 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.619
 best player from the pack of the three 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.510
 Leaky we said we add that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.040
 team appeals to me it's a sam 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.660
 a striker still a zm 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 who it is exactly that we want 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.840
 Of course there is nothing boy then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 the link to the video can be found below 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.579
 the video description necessarily 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 drop by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 and maybe it's suarez up front 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 for example or big or we have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.050
 there league looks in any case over 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 and with that I would say we give you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.440
 now just 30 and stop that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.969
 Watch the video and then show you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 what we have for a team so 321 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.489
 hans tock 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.500
 whoever looks now blame yourself 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.809
 friends so i would actually start 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.939
 I just ended up pulling 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.520
 I start with the worst 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.450
 You can see it in the background now 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.979
 Actually we already have the pack 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 addressed impact opening 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.009
 addressed absolute insolence namely 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.630
 namely, always bubu was on the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.900
 six hammer the dear 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.009
 yaya touré this is one you can do 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.439
 a bit more use but 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.950
 also nothing extremely blatant and front of the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.829
 best then in the last zdf ski though 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 unfortunately god is not blue but good yes 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.280
 too bad a pity 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.369
 Julian had a bit of a turn for it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 a bit more luck yes so I was fine 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.259
 also relatively bad on with egger here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 as a defender in a 100 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.579
 Perfect that you have to imagine 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.189
 By the way, exactly the same with brother 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 were the best 100 capex of all time 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.750
 and next, I think so 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.700
 müller or maybe before that is yes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 no matter what, no outstanding player 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.390
 and then there was still a potts and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.980
 Although you talk about skills and not 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.080
 outstanding but always 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.860
 a team on the shoot and the team 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.000
 around it you see yes and yes yes and with 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 more march to the team as I said 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.150
 make players against each other I will 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.170
 snip the whole thing together and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.750
 in which are ready to start 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.390
 if you can probably too 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.950
 Free kicks do not shoot so well anymore 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 for me earlier I have to admit, though 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:39.750
 right petted just over the net 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.310
 even now he is not running after you café 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:51.350
 what am I doing well in between here 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.350
 thrown out of trouble the best way 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 Ribery is not the most dangerous one 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.120
 who ever what 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.800
 no no 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.980
 Upper Austrian 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.400
 an elfmeter no no idea everything gone 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.209
 and also bsr was typical fifa 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 again the assumed 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.909
 the ice cold was ski the skin 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.909
 things in 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:02.870
 I do not like the defense 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.870
 had luck over the outposts 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:34.380
 or the back and skin of the rhine 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:37.020
 also a complete com already ots that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.419
 that was the fifa thing now 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.350
 format error that was right now 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.300
 It was my fault when I attacked 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.639
 to let the tory shit 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.490
 that was not only since today that is 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.160
 nothing new and deeper and half yes 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.139
 At half-time, the club looks forward to zero 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.590
 I would sometimes say last week 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.250
 absolutely sad typical fifa the others 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.449
 land otherwise deserves guidance so 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.180
 I have to improve now 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:16.200
 now is exciting here comes the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:16.860
 comeback is not really mine yet 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.580
 defense 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.840
 It was but I thought offside 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.450
 I do not know the one about 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.620
 player does not seem to be that good 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:33.229
 but it is not everything that the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.229
 player 799 industry age what is he doing 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:51.150
 every gate that had gone astray 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:59.760
 was later can do that later properly 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:02.389
 now with those also pure again 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.800
 that has already looked like 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.800
 too obvious 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:19.400
 Rosicky is coming back like the nemo 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.400
 just double chance 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:30.669
 I thought I was risking something or something 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.009
 a bad one but they do not care 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.590
 I fall in love with the loco already 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:47.650
 addicted to it as we each live 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:52.030
 stream to the game of goalkeepers at the 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.099
 was normal nor his best tried 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.719
 and Liza Li for the third 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.819
 there are incredible so yes circuit from 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.440
 over 51 I'm a bit 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.050
 surprised I did not think so but 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.729
 it's kind of real lions cup with 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.990
 I can not do anything with the good teams 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.960
 such teams are not really that 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.340
 Everything goes what I do not know what's called 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.030
 because I'm a club fan, they have one too 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.080
 no good played good in any case 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.909
 and deservedly won 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.530
 because with my team but also really 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.990
 not clear no idea what was there 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.550
 wrong and maybe we can 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.810
 yes someday make my revanche 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.180
 yes I think there you are hot on the 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.969
 brought hotter than you now 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.710
 probably berlin 97 with lewandowski 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:37.360
 the best man of midfielder 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.250
 not bad in front of the central defensive 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.680
 but I would say it at the moment 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.880
 thank you for playing again anyway 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.099
 for the whole 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.060
 Who wants to see spec ops again? 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.289
 I would like to be able to do it again 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.789
 Stop by the left is in the video 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.199
 description and with that I would say 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:51.729
 if you liked it, let it be 

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.259
 Thumbs up there I would be me 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.509
 very happy about it and the last ones 

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:57.400
 julian gets the words yes was cool times 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.920
 to do with their video was that 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.660
 first video of us both 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.670
 and then let the thumb in any case 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.290
 up for that the focus if it you 

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:08.000
 I liked it and then I would say 

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.000
 Take a good look and look
