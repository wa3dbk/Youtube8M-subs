00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 work began on the spin-off deadpool 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.710
 ryan reynolds 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.870
 currently busy promoting new 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 comedy action ghost patrol but 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 total film during the interview with the star 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 could not resist not to ask 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.510
 the question that concerns us all at what stage 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.510
 is the deadpool movie 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.949
 a couple of months ago reynolds told 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 im a couple that is already prepared script 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.280
 separate project in the center of events 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 which will be fierce cruel deadpool 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 for total film the actor is even bigger 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 opened the curtain saying the heroes of the projects 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 knows that he is a comic character knows what 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 he acts in film knows even 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 producers who work as a painting 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 we are at the stage of writing the script and deadpool 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.489
 in the course of the new film about wolverine he is not 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 speaks of him badly but in one of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.219
 scenes he plays with curiosity with a figurine 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.219
 and deadpool 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.850
 all this is nice but what is the movie 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 status damn it removed or not 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.750
 earlier Reynolds suggested 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.619
 that fox hesitates with the project as it fears 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.890
 what will they give him 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.780
 nc-17 rating and in the last interview he 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.810
 made no promises said only 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.259
 this project is alive and well 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.390
 then dead and immovable then he is alive again 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.450
 and healthy and dead again it's the worst 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 relationships in my life we ​​all know how 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.290
 Hollywood works while the project is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.780
 at the design stage we have to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.780
 wait until the fox gives him the green light 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.159
 are there any ardent fans among you 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.000
