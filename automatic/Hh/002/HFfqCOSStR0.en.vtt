00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello Pegasus with you I start the series 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.390
 guides for what a wonderful 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.550
 to the designer as an expert 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.340
 it is an electrical constructor which 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:17.460
 You can buy in the radio 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 like that looks like so start 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 today we will collect 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.010
 fan to be lit by two 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.070
 lanterns here is a detail that will be needed 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.199
 here we have two power supplies 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 connecting things so seven 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.040
 six four threesome threesome two and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.170
 order to here us fan this one 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.110
 month 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 Complete two flashlights and a button which 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.910
 will be due to the action so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.250
 let's start first we will mount two 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:01:03.960
 power supply 1 we fasten here until it clicks 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:07.130
 so 2 me we attach here we need to put 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.780
 closer here 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:16.970
 this is also a click away then we take 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.970
 seven here it is not all things put it 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:27.900
 here we put and take two flashlights 1 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 we put here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:38.420
 Pouch 2 we put the court 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:48.680
 started the third we put in the middle 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:58.299
 so close here and here in blue who 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:03.860
 here so now we put a deuce 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:09.500
 one in this here got here we connect all 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:12.500
 this is all 90 idea power supply second 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.330
 and most importantly you need not care 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 forever so that you need a power supply that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.049
 everything worked up plus people with plus and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.150
 minus ideas with min su take columns of these 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.080
 stuff 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:34.510
 we take them three things is enough for us 2 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:38.390
 and stretch the six put it here 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.450
 we are now connected plus a plus 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.880
 now we connect minus minus set 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.760
 connect one block button here 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.570
 plus with plus now the operator 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.380
 will show the matter of closer distance here 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:07.630
 so here is so average adj + plus 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.630
 so now we add so here 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:20.170
 a little hitch 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.349
 so now we add a button here 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.349
 Now 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.930
 We connect the button with a small button and 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:34.720
 we do all this we connect the power supply 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.489
 above we remove for a while we put a deuce 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.290
 so that's what happened now 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.250
 we take it like this now 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.769
 we take six 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.720
 attach it with minus 7 need 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:58.299
 latch so attached now to us 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.450
 need to connect the button became here we 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.450
 set 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:15.180
 we put the top three 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:19.709
 so here we do it here 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.010
 I need here another four that I wanted 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:33.030
 wear three things 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:39.000
 taktivin and add one button so 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.440
 now let's see where he doesn't need us 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.880
 button is needed everywhere 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.229
 and here the button does not need a mistake 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.500
 got out 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.380
 we attach it to the light bulb 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.810
 educate the power supply that goes 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.350
 this line is like this 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.930
 light bulb 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.710
 here is the applicant our one that goes buttons 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.400
 alt on to workers and power supply + + he 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.080
 him spence 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.789
 and now remains the easiest we 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:17.270
 we attach the whole thing to our parts 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:21.330
 threesome goes with us sevens groundhog building site 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.210
 track construction site everything is ready like this 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.960
 get a red operator the whole thing 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.960
 bye time 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.800
 that's how it all turns out the most important thing 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.490
 plus plus minus minus that's all 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.310
 close in perspective here do not forget 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.560
 one button, and then you will hang 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.560
 will be ugly and can be cordoned off 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.139
 something that will break 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:54.419
 so what we are doing now is 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:59.460
 interesting now we take yellow himself 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.610
 fan put it on the turntable all 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.410
 attached so that it is securely fastened and 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.720
 trembled and now the most interesting 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.460
 conduct experience get it or not push 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.300
 a button here and it all starts 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.159
 spin 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:32.000
 now we start so that it is unstuck 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:35.569
 Now open the vote is not necessary 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.669
 consecrated in all the light bulb and now we 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:42.530
 spend could take off or not we accelerate 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:46.110
 and dramatically lower no we didn't take off 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:51.690
 Now you need to swap because 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:58.469
 It is necessary to grow to -1 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:00.659
 attached deuce blocks now we 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:04.020
 we put a virtual turntable 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:09.710
 fan blows off again 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.710
 accelerate overclock accelerates and and 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.370
 the ashes of our operator 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:25.229
 we are re- improve or again 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:27.060
 no overclock overclock and flew away to everyone 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.349
