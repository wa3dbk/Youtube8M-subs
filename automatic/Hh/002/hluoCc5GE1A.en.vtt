00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
have that we've done to the bike let's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
have a look see down here first thing

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
have a look see down here first thing
you'll<00:00:58.050> notice<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.769> old<00:00:58.949> single<00:00:59.280> sided

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you'll notice is the old single sided

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.549 
you'll notice is the old single sided
swinging<00:01:00.089> arm<00:01:00.239> has<00:01:00.389> done<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.929> be<00:01:01.050> replaced<00:01:01.409> by

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
swinging arm has done to be replaced by

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.910 
swinging arm has done to be replaced by
this<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.829> more<00:01:02.159> conventional<00:01:02.489> twin<00:01:03.149> armed<00:01:03.449> one

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
this a more conventional twin armed one

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
this a more conventional twin armed one
fabricated<00:01:04.920> aluminium<00:01:05.430> job<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> big

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
fabricated aluminium job but the big

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880 
fabricated aluminium job but the big
thing<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> saved<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.350> hell<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
thing is it saved a hell of a lot of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.249 
thing is it saved a hell of a lot of
weight<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.759> a<00:01:08.820> half<00:01:09.000> kilos<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
weight two and a half kilos so that is a

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.600 
weight two and a half kilos so that is a
lot<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> weight<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.829> lot<00:01:11.009> of<00:01:11.130> unsprung<00:01:11.549> weight

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
lot of weight a lot of unsprung weight

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
lot of weight a lot of unsprung weight
so<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.420> why<00:01:12.540> they've<00:01:12.689> done<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.110> coming

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so that's why they've done that coming

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
so that's why they've done that coming
up<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.399> frame<00:01:14.579> here<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.869> very

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
up to the frame here this looks very

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
up to the frame here this looks very
very<00:01:16.290> familiar<00:01:16.799> than<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> always<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
very familiar than it always with this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.580 
very familiar than it always with this
twin<00:01:18.450> tube<00:01:18.689> thing<00:01:18.899> makes<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> very<00:01:19.380> very

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
twin tube thing makes it very very

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
twin tube thing makes it very very
distinctive<00:01:20.310> they've<00:01:20.759> changed<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
distinctive they've changed it and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.730 
distinctive they've changed it and
modified<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.289> years<00:01:22.439> they've

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
modified it over the years they've

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.080 
modified it over the years they've
trimmed<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> weight<00:01:23.700> off<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
trimmed a little bit of weight off it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
trimmed a little bit of weight off it
but<00:01:24.210> basically<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> same<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.189> engine

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
but basically that's the same the engine

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
but basically that's the same the engine
which<00:01:26.700> unfortunately<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> can't<00:01:27.630> see<00:01:27.930> under

which unfortunately you can't see under

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440 
which unfortunately you can't see under
all<00:01:28.289> these<00:01:28.530> cases<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.700> nevertheless<00:01:30.060> had

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
all these cases that's nevertheless had

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
all these cases that's nevertheless had
a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.719> attention<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.469> the<00:01:31.799> cylinder

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a lot of attention to it the cylinder

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740 
a lot of attention to it the cylinder
head<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> brand<00:01:32.880> new<00:01:33.000> they've<00:01:33.359> changed<00:01:33.600> the

the hit angle which you can't really see
any<00:01:49.950> difference<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.000> tell<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
any difference here but I can tell you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.209 
any difference here but I can tell you
it's<00:01:51.450> much<00:01:51.750> steeper<00:01:52.229> than<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> used<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.829> in

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
it's much steeper than it used to be in

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.889 
it's much steeper than it used to be in
fact<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.850> steeper<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.600> fire

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
fact it's now steeper than the fire

and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.280> expecting<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> really

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and I was expecting some it really

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.779 
and I was expecting some it really
twitchy<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.399> something<00:02:02.399> else<00:02:02.640> if

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
twitchy but it's not something else if

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.459 
twitchy but it's not something else if
you<00:02:02.850> give<00:02:03.090> me<00:02:03.179> an<00:02:03.509> overall<00:02:03.810> view<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you give me an overall view of it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.929 
you give me an overall view of it
they've<00:02:04.679> actually<00:02:04.829> shortened<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> wheelbase

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
they've actually shortened the wheelbase

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
they've actually shortened the wheelbase
again<00:02:06.359> it's<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.630> difficult<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
again it's very difficult for you to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
again it's very difficult for you to
tell<00:02:07.829> looking<00:02:08.130> at<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> back<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> but

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
tell looking at the back like that but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
tell looking at the back like that but
they<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.780> shortened<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.319> by<00:02:10.440> 25<00:02:10.890> mil<00:02:11.190> which

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
they have shortened it by 25 mil which

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
they have shortened it by 25 mil which
is<00:02:11.519> an<00:02:11.640> inch<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.450> again<00:02:12.750> he<00:02:12.870> brings<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> into

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
is an inch and again he brings it into

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200 
is an inch and again he brings it into
that<00:02:13.560> same<00:02:13.890> ballpark<00:02:14.190> as

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
that same ballpark as

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.690 
that same ballpark as
the<00:02:15.300> Aprilia<00:02:15.750> rsv4<00:02:18.980> bit<00:02:19.980> shorter<00:02:20.460> but

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the Aprilia rsv4 bit shorter but

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.550 
the Aprilia rsv4 bit shorter but
basically<00:02:21.240> they're<00:02:21.630> all<00:02:21.660> battling<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
basically they're all battling in that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.590 
basically they're all battling in that
same<00:02:22.800> ring<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.730> what<00:02:23.880> else<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.150> new

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
same ring so what else is new

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.540 
same ring so what else is new
despairing<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:25.620> thing<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:26.190> only<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
despairing for one thing not only is it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.520 
despairing for one thing not only is it
a<00:02:26.700> brand<00:02:26.970> new<00:02:27.150> design<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.900> big<00:02:28.200> blends

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
a brand new design with this big blends

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
here still twin headlights behind it but

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.080 
here still twin headlights behind it but
as<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.410> see<00:02:31.470> very<00:02:32.130> distinctive<00:02:32.790> nothing

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
as you can see very distinctive nothing

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
as you can see very distinctive nothing
like<00:02:33.240> any<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> other<00:02:33.810> bikes<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
like any of the other bikes but the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
like any of the other bikes but the
fairing<00:02:34.980> itself<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.430> actually<00:02:35.550> slimmer

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
fairing itself is actually slimmer

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.830 
fairing itself is actually slimmer
saving<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.960> more<00:02:37.170> weight<00:02:37.940> down<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.210> front

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
saving a bit more weight down here front

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.650 
saving a bit more weight down here front
wheel<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.800> TT<00:02:41.130> 600<00:02:41.820> again<00:02:42.300> that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
wheel is now from the TT 600 again that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.420 
wheel is now from the TT 600 again that
is<00:02:42.810> saving<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> weight<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.980> rest<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
is saving like a weight the rest of it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.700 
is saving like a weight the rest of it
they've<00:02:44.580> retained<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.150> big<00:02:45.300> 320<00:02:45.870> ml<00:02:46.050> discs<00:02:46.470> and

they've retained a big 320 ml discs and
triumphs<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.340> putts<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.090> six<00:02:48.360> pots<00:02:48.570> are

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
triumphs for putts I know six pots are

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.390 
triumphs for putts I know six pots are
fashionable<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:49.380> their<00:02:49.560> triumph<00:02:49.860> stoppers

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
fashionable but their triumph stoppers

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.030 
fashionable but their triumph stoppers
really<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:50.970> work<00:02:51.380> first<00:02:52.380> front<00:02:52.620> forks<00:02:52.920> are

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
really do work first front forks are

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
really do work first front forks are

unchanged not upside down at

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.360 
unchanged not upside down at
conventional<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.310> look

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
conventional but I really like that look

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.190 
conventional but I really like that look
they<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:57.030> look<00:02:57.180> big<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.780> chunky<00:02:57.990> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
they really do look big and chunky and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.160 
they really do look big and chunky and
again<00:02:58.560> very<00:02:59.040> triumph<00:02:59.640> like<00:02:59.870> what<00:03:00.870> else<00:03:01.020> have

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
again very triumph like what else have

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.960 
again very triumph like what else have
they<00:03:01.260> done<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.010> back<00:03:02.190> tyre<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.670> right<00:03:02.820> side

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
they done the back tyre the right side

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.520 
they done the back tyre the right side
is<00:03:03.060> slim<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.540> down<00:03:03.720> would<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.960> believe<00:03:04.080> used

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
is slim that down would you believe used

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.770 
is slim that down would you believe used
to<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> 190<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.490> old<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> 1

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
to be a 190 on the old one it's now a 1

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.690 
to be a 190 on the old one it's now a 1
AC<00:03:06.930> that's<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.680> improve<00:03:08.040> handling<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.640> I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
AC that's to improve handling and I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.130 
AC that's to improve handling and I
suppose<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> does<00:03:09.300> save<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:09.900> bit<00:03:10.020> more

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
suppose it does save a little bit more

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.860 
suppose it does save a little bit more
weight<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:11.880> only<00:03:11.940> looks<00:03:12.180> different

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
weight so it not only looks different

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.600 
weight so it not only looks different
with<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.380> weight<00:03:13.650> saving<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.280> actually

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
with that weight saving it actually

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.030 
with that weight saving it actually
feels<00:03:14.880> different<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.870> retained<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> solid

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
