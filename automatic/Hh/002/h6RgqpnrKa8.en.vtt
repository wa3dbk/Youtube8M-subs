00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everybody today I'll show you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.410
 in neutral makeup that I really like 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.410
 to do 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.840
 so the first step I like 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.789
 put on fixative this time I liked it 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.900
 From the roots I spend the whole year 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.740
 including under the eyelid 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740
 entire 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 this step is optional but I like 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 put a few steps following the line of the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 my eye 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.600
 the first makeup thing I use one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:48.200
 great musician and likes to concentrate 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 enough in the three quarters of the mobile cop 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 While I'm doing this, I'm going 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.559
 foaming including on the underside 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.559
 also cool 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:34.900
 and with the same brush on the other side I 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.780
 I step a golden shadow in the corner 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.890
 the copy of the property and also 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 mixed with hoover musician to give this 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:56.040
 great cool with a shimmering shadow 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.040
 well clarinha I put well in the corner 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 under eyebrow 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 after that I put a brown one 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 little darker to give a definition 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.840
 better in the corner 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.050
 other means can use it and it's cool 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050
 also 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.310
 after having a little more definition I 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.880
 put the black pencil on the water line 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.880
 of nature 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.240
 then I have my eye on a 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.120
 black liquid eyeliner and the legacy of 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.160
 drec that help and help for you 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.160
 make a line in perfect 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 that after the shot of the former I use a little 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 of ex color and place the river 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.340
 in this case I used colossal but you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.340
 you can use anyone who has 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 this next step is optional but after 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.480
 pick up a false eyelash and cut half 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.470
 I'll put on my lap later and hope to stay 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.470
 more or less about 30 seconds 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.830
 then placed in an outer corner of the eye 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.530
 As my cola is not very good and she 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.220
 white afterwards, but not just 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.870
 has no black actor ever solves 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.430
 then I put it a little more terrible 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.610
 to blend my children with eyelashes 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.610
 false 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:28.020
 and it 's the look that's ready, it stays this way 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.500
 easy to do 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.500
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.170
 and this is the before and after even more 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.170
 low
