cable but on the 350 turbo 350 this is

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.729 
cable but on the 350 turbo 350 this is
this<00:00:28.390> cable<00:00:28.809> that<00:00:28.899> comes<00:00:29.110> in<00:00:29.380> from<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
this cable that comes in from the

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.609 
this cable that comes in from the
accelerator<00:00:30.540> arm<00:00:31.540> on<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.989> carburetor<00:00:32.439> up

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
accelerator arm on the carburetor up

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.370 
accelerator arm on the carburetor up
there<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:34.570> it<00:00:34.719> does<00:00:34.899> is<00:00:35.110> when<00:00:35.230> the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
there and what it does is when the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.740 
there and what it does is when the
carburetor<00:00:35.829> reaches<00:00:36.309> just<00:00:36.550> about<00:00:37.120> wide-open

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
carburetor reaches just about wide-open

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.040 
carburetor reaches just about wide-open
throttle<00:00:37.989> or<00:00:38.320> shortly<00:00:39.160> before<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.570> falls<00:00:40.780> on

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
throttle or shortly before it falls on

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.049 
throttle or shortly before it falls on
this<00:00:41.200> cable<00:00:41.469> that's<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.100> cable<00:00:42.430> end<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.940> it

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
this cable that's the cable end of it

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.599 
this cable that's the cable end of it
these<00:00:43.210> seat-belted<00:00:43.809> on<00:00:44.019> it<00:00:44.289> there<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.949> pulls

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
these seat-belted on it there and pulls

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.540 
these seat-belted on it there and pulls
the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
the
pulls<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.540> little<00:00:48.780> valve<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pulls a little valve and the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
pulls a little valve and the
transmission<00:00:49.890> valve<00:00:50.280> body<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> makes<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
transmission valve body and it makes it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.200 
transmission valve body and it makes it
kick<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.579> that's<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.790> get<00:00:53.969> your

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
kick down so that's how you get your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350 
kick down so that's how you get your
automatic<00:00:54.510> kick<00:00:54.840> down

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.810 

this<00:00:58.930> one<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.560> problem<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.070> with<00:01:00.250> this<00:01:00.370> one<00:01:00.640> is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
this one the problem is with this one is

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.030 
this one the problem is with this one is
it<00:01:01.390> wouldn't<00:01:01.630> do<00:01:01.870> anything<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.560> doesn't<00:01:02.740> come

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
it wouldn't do anything it doesn't come

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.920 
it wouldn't do anything it doesn't come
out<00:01:03.160> doesn't<00:01:03.520> go<00:01:03.640> back<00:01:03.820> into<00:01:04.059> any<00:01:04.239> move<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:04.900> I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
out doesn't go back into any move so I

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.950 
out doesn't go back into any move so I
got<00:01:05.260> in<00:01:05.379> here<00:01:05.500> looking<00:01:05.770> at<00:01:05.890> my<00:01:05.980> daddy<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
got in here looking at my daddy and it

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.440 
got in here looking at my daddy and it
comes<00:01:08.170> around<00:01:08.320> out<00:01:08.680> here<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:10.030> can<00:01:10.240> see

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
comes around out here you can see

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.690 
comes around out here you can see
they're<00:01:10.600> not<00:01:10.810> there's<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.170> nice<00:01:11.410> big<00:01:11.710> burn<00:01:12.100> spot

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
they're not there's a nice big burn spot

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.030 
they're not there's a nice big burn spot
out<00:01:13.060> there<00:01:13.300> where<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:13.630> was<00:01:13.770> laying<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:14.890> the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
out there where it was laying on the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.400 
out there where it was laying on the
exhaust<00:01:15.310> pipe<00:01:15.670> presumably<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.780> it's<00:01:17.050> just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
exhaust pipe presumably so it's just

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.810 
exhaust pipe presumably so it's just
totally<00:01:17.920> shot<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.790> there's<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.420> other<00:01:19.600> end

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
totally shot and there's the other end

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.010 
totally shot and there's the other end
here

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
here

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.980 
here
that's<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.770> part<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.040> goes<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.219 

the<00:01:27.920> carburetor<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.659> goes<00:01:29.869> in<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> little

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
the carburetor and this goes in a little

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.080 
the carburetor and this goes in a little
bracket<00:01:30.530> I'll<00:01:30.799> show<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.100> later<00:01:31.310> on<00:01:31.460> after<00:01:31.970> its

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
bracket I'll show you later on after its

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.789 
bracket I'll show you later on after its
installed<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.780> slips<00:01:33.049> in<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> bracket<00:01:33.680> it

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
installed but it slips in a bracket it

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.430 
installed but it slips in a bracket it
there<00:01:34.010> at<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.190> top<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.869> thing<00:01:36.110> right

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
there at the top and this thing right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.170 
there at the top and this thing right
here<00:01:36.470> when<00:01:37.010> I<00:01:37.100> thought<00:01:37.310> me<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.729> supposed<00:01:38.060> to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
here when I thought me is supposed to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.120 
here when I thought me is supposed to
have<00:01:38.300> two<00:01:38.900> little<00:01:39.820> plastic<00:01:41.680> parts<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.920> kind

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
have two little plastic parts that kind

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.880 
have two little plastic parts that kind
of<00:01:43.220> come<00:01:43.400> out<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.610> kind<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.180> clamp<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.080> snap

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
of come out and kind of clamp it in snap

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.990 
of come out and kind of clamp it in snap
it<00:01:46.070> in<00:01:46.190> of<00:01:47.030> course<00:01:47.360> those<00:01:47.540> are<00:01:47.630> busted<00:01:48.140> off<00:01:48.320> so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
it in of course those are busted off so

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.999 
it in of course those are busted off so
they're<00:01:50.000> our<00:01:50.119> solution<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.780> retain<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.560> I'm

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
they're our solution to retain this I'm

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.469 
they're our solution to retain this I'm
just<00:01:52.190> if<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.490> get<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.729> right<00:01:52.850> side<00:01:53.180> here

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
just if I can get the right side here

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.920 
just if I can get the right side here
yeah

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
yeah

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.969 
yeah
yes<00:01:55.210> yeah<00:01:56.210> right<00:01:57.050> there<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.560> hole

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
yes yeah right there you see that hole

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.790 
yes yeah right there you see that hole
right<00:01:58.220> there<00:01:58.280> right<00:01:58.820> there<00:01:59.000> by<00:01:59.149> my<00:01:59.330> thumb

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
right there right there by my thumb

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.919 
right there right there by my thumb
that's<00:02:00.800> where<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.039> had<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> screw<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.479> would

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's where I had a screw in it would

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.779 
that's where I had a screw in it would
screw<00:02:03.320> small<00:02:03.800> would<00:02:04.039> screw<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:04.580> what

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
screw small would screw that's what

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.040 
screw small would screw that's what
helped<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.149> in<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.390> bracket<00:02:07.300> so<00:02:08.300> about<00:02:08.840> nuts

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
helped it in the bracket so about nuts

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.810 
helped it in the bracket so about nuts
cable<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.890> I'm<00:02:09.950> gonna<00:02:10.100> put<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> cable<00:02:10.700> on

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
cable and I'm gonna put the cable on

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.370 
cable and I'm gonna put the cable on

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
pan off you gonna do this bolt and you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.970 
pan off you gonna do this bolt and you
see<00:02:17.630> I've<00:02:17.750> cleaned<00:02:18.050> around<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.830> keep

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
see I've cleaned around it to keep

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.830 
see I've cleaned around it to keep
getting<00:02:19.760> from<00:02:20.060> getting<00:02:20.360> dirt<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
getting from getting dirt in the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.110 
getting from getting dirt in the
transmission<00:02:21.440> hopeful<00:02:21.860> bit<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.730> take<00:02:22.940> that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
transmission hopeful bit you take that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.949 
transmission hopeful bit you take that
bolt<00:02:23.360> out<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.110> pull<00:02:24.350> this<00:02:24.500> thing<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
bolt out and you pull this thing up and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.970 
bolt out and you pull this thing up and
I'll<00:02:26.959> show<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.230> all<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> other<00:02:27.650> ones<00:02:27.830> just

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
I'll show you all the other ones just

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.130 
I'll show you all the other ones just
got<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> little<00:02:28.420> hole<00:02:29.420> wire<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
got a little hole wire and the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.470 
got a little hole wire and the
transmission<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.980> hooks<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.299> just

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
transmission that hooks into it you just

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.590 
transmission that hooks into it you just
change<00:02:32.840> them<00:02:33.019> out<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:34.180> tedious<00:02:35.180> but

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
change them out kind of tedious but

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
change them out kind of tedious but
shouldn't<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> really<00:02:36.890> big<00:02:36.980> deal

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
shouldn't be a really big deal

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.309 
shouldn't be a really big deal
so<00:02:39.000> hopefully<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.750> would<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.110> work

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
so hopefully that would get that work

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.170 
so hopefully that would get that work
and<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.100> transmission<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:41.970> guy

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and this is this transmission this guy

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
and this is this transmission this guy
said<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.630> truck<00:02:42.900> had<00:02:43.080> racing<00:02:43.620> transmission

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
said this truck had racing transmission

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.940 
said this truck had racing transmission
in<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.569> sure<00:02:45.930> looks<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.770> me

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
in it and it sure looks like one to me

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.670 
in it and it sure looks like one to me
that<00:02:48.770> what<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.800> figure<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.990 

you<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.800> even<00:02:54.130> seeing<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.400> other<00:02:54.520> sign<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
you know even seeing the other sign that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.490 
you know even seeing the other sign that
dirty<00:02:55.240> it<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.900> afrin<00:02:56.230> already

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
dirty it is this is afrin already

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800 
dirty it is this is afrin already
cleaned<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.890> off<00:02:57.070> some<00:02:57.370> well<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.090> figure<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
cleaned it off some well I figure is the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.840 
cleaned it off some well I figure is the
detent<00:02:59.170> cup<00:02:59.380> will<00:02:59.530> stuck<00:02:59.830> out<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.700> makes

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
detent cup will stuck out and it makes

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.360 
detent cup will stuck out and it makes
it<00:03:01.060> shift<00:03:01.330> at<00:03:01.540> higher<00:03:01.840> rpm<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.250> got

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
it shift at higher rpm so like it's got

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.400 
it shift at higher rpm so like it's got
a<00:03:03.400> shift<00:03:03.670> kit<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.210> I'll<00:03:04.960> tell<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.170> what

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
a shift kit in it I'll tell you what

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.260 
a shift kit in it I'll tell you what
they<00:03:05.590> are<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.010> gullible<00:03:06.370> they'll<00:03:06.970> believe

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
they are so gullible they'll believe

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.750 
they are so gullible they'll believe
anything<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.860> know<00:03:09.010> they<00:03:09.160> make<00:03:09.340> assumptions

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
anything you know they make assumptions

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.980 
anything you know they make assumptions
that<00:03:10.060> are<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.480> stupid<00:03:10.870> sometimes

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
that are so stupid sometimes

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.560 
that are so stupid sometimes
rice<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.260> transmission<00:03:14.920> yeah

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
rice and transmission yeah

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.050 
rice and transmission yeah
sure<00:03:16.570> looks<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.990> one<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.640> believe<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.940> how

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
sure looks like one I believe it how

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
sure looks like one I believe it how
about<00:03:19.120> you

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
about you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.680 
about you
optional<00:03:21.340> dirt<00:03:21.610> coating<00:03:22.060> all<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.360> keeps<00:03:22.570> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
optional dirt coating all that keeps it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.720 
optional dirt coating all that keeps it
running<00:03:22.840> warmer<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:24.250> let's<00:03:24.400> look<00:03:24.520> at<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
running warmer so let's look at the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.890 
running warmer so let's look at the
movement<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.180> got<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:27.450> got<00:03:28.450> em<00:03:28.690> lawn

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
movement we got it here got em lawn

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.600 
movement we got it here got em lawn
mower<00:03:29.170> -<00:03:29.350> rolling<00:03:29.709> today<00:03:32.280> here's<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> new<00:03:33.580> one

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
mower - rolling today here's the new one

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.750 
mower - rolling today here's the new one
and<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.950> part<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.280> standing<00:03:36.640> back

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
and this is the part a standing back

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.520 
and this is the part a standing back
Goes<00:03:36.940> Down<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.300> a<00:03:37.390> transmission<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.320> that's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
Goes Down and a transmission so that's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.979 
Goes Down and a transmission so that's
all<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:38.950> have<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.250> swap<00:03:39.580> out<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.180> get<00:03:40.870> this

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
all you have to swap out just get this

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.479 
all you have to swap out just get this
thing<00:03:41.050> hooked<00:03:41.380> over<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.800> little<00:03:41.920> wire<00:03:42.190> and

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
thing hooked over that little wire and

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.560 
thing hooked over that little wire and
then<00:03:42.610> bolt<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.200> out<00:03:44.200> there

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.790 

this<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:50.360> your<00:03:51.360> gesture<00:03:51.960> this<00:03:52.170> snaps<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
this is your your gesture this snaps in

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.710 
this is your your gesture this snaps in
this<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.160> what<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> was<00:03:53.460> talking<00:03:53.670> about<00:03:53.850> while

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
this is what I was talking about while

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.440 
this is what I was talking about while
ago<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.260> little<00:03:55.910> snapshot<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.120> they're

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
ago this little snapshot there they're

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.600 
ago this little snapshot there they're
missing<00:03:57.960> off<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.290> helmet<00:03:59.120> so<00:04:01.220> anyway<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.430> is

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
missing off the helmet so anyway this is

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.220 
missing off the helmet so anyway this is
one<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:03.420> decimal<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.110> this

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
one of the this is a decimal and this

a lot of folklore about these things

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.270 
a lot of folklore about these things
people<00:04:27.650> say<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.220> don't<00:04:28.250> need<00:04:28.550> them<00:04:28.790> all<00:04:28.910> you

people say you don't need them all you
you<00:04:31.280> can<00:04:31.430> run<00:04:31.550> well<00:04:31.790> you<00:04:31.910> probably<00:04:32.090> can<00:04:32.390> run

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
you can run well you probably can run

you can run well you probably can run
that<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.840> probably<00:04:33.020> wouldn't<00:04:33.260> hurt<00:04:33.470> them<00:04:33.590> it's

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
that I probably wouldn't hurt them it's

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.570 
that I probably wouldn't hurt them it's
not<00:04:33.890> like<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.130> 700r4<00:04:34.790> then<00:04:35.330> burn<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:35.660> up<00:04:35.930> but

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
not like a 700r4 then burn it up but

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.790 
not like a 700r4 then burn it up but
because<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.000> not<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.330> this<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:39.080> not<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.380> TV

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
to throttle valve cable it has to be

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.300 
to throttle valve cable it has to be
hooked<00:05:01.020> up<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.470> adjusted<00:05:01.919> or<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.100> burner

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
hooked up and adjusted or the burner

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.129 
hooked up and adjusted or the burner
transmission<00:05:02.940> up<00:05:03.060> on<00:05:03.210> these<00:05:03.389> it's<00:05:03.750> not<00:05:03.810> that

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
transmission up on these it's not that

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.379 
transmission up on these it's not that
crucial<00:05:04.820> when<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.910> don't<00:05:06.090> have<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.330> thing

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
crucial when you don't have this thing

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.000 
crucial when you don't have this thing
hooked<00:05:06.660> up<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.110> only<00:05:07.290> thing<00:05:07.470> is<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.770> can't

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
hooked up the only thing is you can't

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.860 
hooked up the only thing is you can't
get<00:05:08.160> any<00:05:08.370> automatic<00:05:08.880> kick<00:05:09.060> down<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.660> have

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
get any automatic kick down so you have

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.450 
get any automatic kick down so you have
to<00:05:09.960> drop<00:05:10.199> it<00:05:10.229> with<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> gearshift<00:05:11.010> in<00:05:11.310> there

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
to drop it with a gearshift in there

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.550 
to drop it with a gearshift in there
which<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.060> kind<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.330> hard<00:05:12.540> on<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:15.410> heck<00:05:16.410> I

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
which is kind of hard on it so heck I

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.870 
which is kind of hard on it so heck I
don't<00:05:16.620> know<00:05:16.889> if<00:05:16.979> this<00:05:17.100> transmission<00:05:17.639> works

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
don't know if this transmission works

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.879 
don't know if this transmission works
yet<00:05:18.240> maybe<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.840> works<00:05:19.050> enough<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.500> go<00:05:19.620> around

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
yet maybe it works enough to go around

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.129 
yet maybe it works enough to go around
the<00:05:19.979> yard<00:05:20.220> but<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:21.360> know<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.660> was<00:05:21.750> only<00:05:21.900> enough

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139
