it's<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.980> decided<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.730> go<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's really pretty so I decided to go to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.450 
it's really pretty so I decided to go to
the<00:00:33.570> salon<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.399> date

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the salon because I know that if I date

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.340 
the salon because I know that if I date
myself<00:00:35.940> I'll<00:00:36.090> probably<00:00:36.329> ruin<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.870> hair<00:00:45.350> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
myself I'll probably ruin my hair so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
myself I'll probably ruin my hair so
actually<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> retouched<00:00:48.180> today

actually I got it retouched today

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.720 
actually I got it retouched today
because<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> thought<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> tips<00:00:50.010> were<00:00:50.250> blonde

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because I thought the tips were blonde

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
because I thought the tips were blonde
enough<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.600> didn't<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
enough and it didn't really look like a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
enough and it didn't really look like a
gradient<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.460> kind<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> looked<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.360> um

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
blog um and I saw one of their clients

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
blog um and I saw one of their clients
pages<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.759> she<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.240> ombre<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pages where she got ombre as well and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
pages where she got ombre as well and
she<00:01:34.890> had<00:01:35.009> pretty<00:01:35.280> short<00:01:35.610> hair<00:01:35.820> compared<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> me

she had pretty short hair compared to me
but<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.079> thought<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.920> gradient<00:01:38.310> effect

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but I thought that so gradient effect

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
but I thought that so gradient effect
looks<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.960> professional<00:01:40.200> so

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
looks really good and professional so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
looks really good and professional so
that's<00:01:41.280> why<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.490> decided<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.090> there<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's why I decided to go there so I
asked<00:01:43.409> my<00:01:43.560> mom<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.979> call<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> salon<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.329> make

one<00:02:02.310> which

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
one which

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.830 
one which
approximately<00:02:03.810> $90<00:02:04.560> um<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.700> US<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
approximately $90 um in the US and I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.910 
approximately $90 um in the US and I
thought<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> pretty<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:07.770> deal

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
thought that was a pretty good deal

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.589 
thought that was a pretty good deal
because<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:09.060> know<00:02:09.119> I've<00:02:09.239> never<00:02:09.450> bought

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
because I don't know I've never bought

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
because I don't know I've never bought
my<00:02:09.780> hair<00:02:10.020> dyeing<00:02:10.259> before<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.950> thought<00:02:11.340> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
my hair dyeing before so I thought that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
my hair dyeing before so I thought that
was<00:02:11.790> pretty<00:02:12.000> cheap<00:02:12.300> correct<00:02:12.840> me<00:02:13.019> if<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.410> wrong

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
was pretty cheap correct me if I'm wrong

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
was pretty cheap correct me if I'm wrong
but<00:02:13.860> yeah<00:02:14.069> I'm<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.519> satisfied<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
but yeah I'm really satisfied with the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
but yeah I'm really satisfied with the
result<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.230> think<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.680> looks<00:02:16.950> really<00:02:17.069> nice<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
result I think it looks really nice and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.839 
result I think it looks really nice and
the<00:02:18.750> touch-up<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.590> got<00:02:19.860> today<00:02:20.069> took<00:02:20.519> one

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
the touch-up that I got today took one

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.059 
the touch-up that I got today took one
hour<00:02:21.239> but<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.170> really<00:02:22.319> didn't<00:02:22.650> feel<00:02:22.769> like<00:02:22.830> one

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
hour but it really didn't feel like one

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.170 
hour but it really didn't feel like one
over<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:23.580> reason<00:02:23.819> because<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> was

important because a few years ago I came

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.180 
important because a few years ago I came
to<00:03:42.239> Korea<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.870> for<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.290> summer<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:43.950> this

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
to Korea and for the summer I got this

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.250 
to Korea and for the summer I got this
kind<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.489> curly<00:03:44.880> perm<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.959> turned<00:03:46.139> out

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
kind of curly perm and it turned out

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.349 
kind of curly perm and it turned out
really<00:03:46.500> badly<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.489> cried<00:03:47.760> every<00:03:48.150> day

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
really badly and I like cried every day

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.539 
really badly and I like cried every day
and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.109> got<00:03:49.290> magic<00:03:49.680> straight<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> few

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
and then I got magic straight a few

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.789 
and then I got magic straight a few
years<00:03:50.760> later<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:52.139> also<00:03:52.350> turned<00:03:52.650> out

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
years later and that also turned out

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.559 
years later and that also turned out
horribly<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.819> sex<00:03:54.060> wore<00:03:54.239> off<00:03:54.359> after

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
horribly because the sex wore off after

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.030 
horribly because the sex wore off after
two<00:03:54.930> days<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> was<00:03:55.739> pretty<00:03:55.920> much

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
two days so I was pretty much

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.030 
two days so I was pretty much
traumatized<00:03:56.730> by<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.230> salon<00:03:58.590> that's

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
traumatized by going to the salon that's

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.620 
traumatized by going to the salon that's
why<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.609> it's<00:04:00.060> really<00:04:00.150> important<00:04:00.599> for

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
why I think it's really important for

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.660 
why I think it's really important for
you<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> find<00:04:01.139> good<00:04:01.290> salon<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.430> live<00:04:02.579> in
