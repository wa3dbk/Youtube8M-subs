00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.229
 M: Yes 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.130
 when we take a look at Jesus' prayer life 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.250
 undoubtedly we find an important challenge 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.250
 since it represents a role model in our Christian life 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 when we come to Jesus with a successful ministry 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.410
 preaching with authority to the crowds 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 doing great miracles 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.650
 sanÃ¡ - fermoselle veranda the demoniacs 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.970
 the obligatory question is how he did it 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.660
 and the first answer we can give is 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.450
 good is that jesus was the son of god 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.550
 but nevertheless 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.070
 the bible shows us that Jesus only used resources 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.540
 that are also at our disposal 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.730
 among them the prayer 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.650
 let's see the gospel of Lucas 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.730
 which shows us the ad hoc human of Jesus 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.740
 shows us a Jesus identified with man 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.189
 and it shows us a Jesus who reveals his emotions 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.990
 but it also shows us a Jesus 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.640
 ravine 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.800
 the first moment of prayer is found in lucas 3 21 22 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.980
 It happened that when all the people were baptized 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.470
 Jesus was also baptized 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.870
 and praying the sky opened 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.510
 and descended from the holy spirit on the sea triumph as by air like dove 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.330
 and there came a voice from heaven that said 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.260
 you are my beloved son 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.250
 I have complacency in you 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 this moment describes the exact meaning of the sentence 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.410
 is the key that opens the doors of heaven 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.110
 describes prayer as the means that leads us to the presence of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.199
 communion with the heavenly father 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.979
 in which we can hear your voice 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.939
 in those moments of prayer when the Holy Spirit descends on our 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.619
 lives 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.899
 and help us 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.649
 another moment of Jesus' prayer we find him in lucas 5 15 16 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.889
 but his fame spread to more and more 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.439
 and a lot of people met to run away 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.279
 and so that they are born of their diseases 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.159
 more than he moved away to desert places and I grada 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 this passage describes a Jesus with a tight schedule 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.790
 but in spite of that, taking time to pray 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.189
 are the moments in our lives or now that our ministry in the 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.250
 which we hurry to work with the dangerous possibility 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.369
 and put the prayer aside 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.539
 are the moments when we get stuck in activities 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.239
 and we fall into a religious activism 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.449
 that only leads us to competition with each other 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.449
 forgetting about our communion with the father 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.609
 Another moment of Jesus' prayer is described by Lucas 6 12 13 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.099
 in those days he was almonte now 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.659
 and he spent the night praying to God 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.229
 and when he drinks 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:26.260
 he called his disciples from and chose 12 of them whom he also called 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.429
 apostles 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.979
 and that uses choosing the team that would be in charge of giving continuity 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.889
 to the gospel after his departure 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.469
 without a doubt a transcendental decision 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 for which it took all night 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.230
 In our life 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.230
 come moments of making big and important decisions 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.329
 in which we have to intensify our prayer 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.289
 maybe 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.199
 not now I walk all night 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.479
 maybe yes 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.669
 but understanding that there are times when we should emphasize the 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.669
 prayer for a particular cause 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.150
 one more episode of prayer 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.859
 they are lucas 9 32 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:06.779
 and Pedro 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.379
 and those who were with him 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.859
 we were rendered sleepy 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.969
 more staying awake 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.339
 they saw the glory of Jesus 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.359
 this passage shows us there are no jesus 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.150
 if not the disciples 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.909
 crown 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.189
 actually which many of us face 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.340
 the difficulty of praying in the middle of the daily hustle 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.069
 of work activity 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.099
 of family responsibilities 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.349
 and the effort that must be carried out to take a daily prayer time 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.889
 despite fatigue and fatigue 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 the moments when the battle between the flesh and the spirit arises 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.900
 but overcoming everything 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.909
 and reaching victory 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.169
 the last moment of prayer is found in lucas 22 39 40 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.110
 leaving he left 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.370
 as he used to 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.940
 The Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.699
 when he arrived at that place he told them 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.309
 Do not enter into temptation 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.529
 the message is clear enough 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.199
 prayer as a weapon of defense against the daily temptations of which 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.809
 we face 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.379
 the moment prayer becomes a vitamin to strengthen 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.349
 the spirit 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.259
 and overcome the moments when the enemy launches said holmes against our life 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.939
 prayer is an act of dedication but also of discipline 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.719
 the prayer is not a mystical fact it is a consequence of chance 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.710
 on the contrary it implies daily effort and determination 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.210
 but it also means entering into a dimension of God's presence 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.419
 where he reveals his heart 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.979
 and remember 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.439
 if Jesus had mercy 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.789
 how much more 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:50.629
 we
