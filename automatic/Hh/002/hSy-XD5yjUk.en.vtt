00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.480 

Oh

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.249 

now<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.090> don't<00:01:37.210> know<00:01:37.450> how<00:01:37.570> come<00:01:37.810> I've<00:01:37.930> got<00:01:38.110> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
now I don't know how come I've got the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.969

right<00:01:38.409> amount<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.829> this<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:41.259> seems<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.740> work

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
right amount of this just seems to work

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:53.140 
right amount of this just seems to work
out<00:01:42.159> like<00:01:42.340> that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.940 

now<00:01:53.750> I<00:01:53.780> didn't<00:01:54.080> put<00:01:54.230> my<00:01:54.350> button<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.740> yet

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
now I didn't put my button on yet

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.370 
now I didn't put my button on yet
because<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.280> haven't<00:01:55.400> found<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.850> right<00:01:55.880> button

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
because I haven't found the right button

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:14.410 
because I haven't found the right button
so<00:01:57.380> i<00:01:57.410> have<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.710> leave<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:58.040> part<00:01:58.310> open<00:02:00.160> okay
