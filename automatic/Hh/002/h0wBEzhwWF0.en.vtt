finally get everything to where it's
good<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.570> don't<00:03:34.900> record<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.260> for<00:03:35.410> two<00:03:35.560> or

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
good and I don't record it for two or

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.990 
good and I don't record it for two or
three<00:03:35.860> weeks<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:36.580> I<00:03:36.610> come<00:03:36.820> back<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
three weeks and then I come back and

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.670 
three weeks and then I come back and
everything<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.540> messed<00:03:37.660> up<00:03:37.840> again<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.620> I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
everything is messed up again so I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.990 
everything is messed up again so I
downloaded<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.160> program<00:03:39.310> called<00:03:39.640> vulture

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
downloaded a program called vulture

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.910 
downloaded a program called vulture
virtualdub<00:03:40.540> which<00:03:40.810> which<00:03:41.200> syncs<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.769> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
virtualdub which which syncs up the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.770 
virtualdub which which syncs up the
audio<00:03:42.100> in<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> video<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.209> now<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.600> working

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
audio in the video so now it's working

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780 
audio in the video so now it's working
great<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.190> expect<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.220> see<00:03:45.310> more<00:03:45.550> that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
great so expect to see more that

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.970 
great so expect to see more that
hopefully<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.510> keeps<00:03:46.840> working<00:03:49.680> I'm<00:03:50.680> saying<00:03:50.950> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
hopefully it keeps working I'm saying a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.140 
hopefully it keeps working I'm saying a
lot<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.190> ohms<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.550> stuff<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.030> what

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
lot of ohms and stuff this is what

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.229 
lot of ohms and stuff this is what
happens<00:03:52.420> when<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.540> don't<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.870> stuff<00:03:53.080> prepared

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
happens when I don't have stuff prepared

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.850 
happens when I don't have stuff prepared
yeah<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.540> video<00:03:55.780> production<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.650> slowed

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
yeah so the video production is slowed

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.490 
yeah so the video production is slowed
down<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.040> bit<00:03:57.209> mostly<00:03:58.209> because<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.570> e<00:03:58.600> GN<00:03:59.019> but<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
down a bit mostly because the e GN but I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.890 
down a bit mostly because the e GN but I
expect<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.070> start<00:04:00.280> spamming<00:04:01.030> your<00:04:01.269> sub<00:04:01.540> boxes

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
expect to start spamming your sub boxes

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.009 
expect to start spamming your sub boxes
again<00:04:02.049> soon<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.970> know<00:04:04.019> hopefully

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
again soon and I you know hopefully

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.530 
again soon and I you know hopefully
that'll<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.680> thought<00:04:06.640> align<00:04:06.880> itself<00:04:07.180> out<00:04:07.390> i'll

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
that'll I thought align itself out i'll

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.240 
that'll I thought align itself out i'll
be<00:04:07.630> able<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.870> get<00:04:07.989> back<00:04:08.079> been<00:04:08.470> very<00:04:08.680> busy<00:04:08.860> just
