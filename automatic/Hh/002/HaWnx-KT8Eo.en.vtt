perfectly<00:03:04.600> done<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.620> sauce<00:03:06.069> was<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.400> good<00:03:06.790> at

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
perfectly done that sauce was so good at

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
perfectly done that sauce was so good at
the<00:03:07.690> end<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.019> was<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:08.709> scraping<00:03:09.220> it

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the end I was like you know scraping it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.280 
the end I was like you know scraping it
off<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.850> dish<00:03:10.060> onto<00:03:10.540> my<00:03:10.660> rice<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.079> could<00:03:11.200> have

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
off the dish onto my rice I could have

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.289 
off the dish onto my rice I could have
taken<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.890> cup<00:03:12.250> home<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> drink<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:12.970> think<00:03:13.180> it's

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
taken a cup home to drink I think it's

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.449 
taken a cup home to drink I think it's
like<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> cornstarch<00:03:14.260> coating<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.160> they<00:03:15.250> put

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
like a cornstarch coating that they put

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.610 
like a cornstarch coating that they put
on<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.819> not<00:03:15.910> super<00:03:16.299> thick<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:17.049> then<00:03:17.500> they

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
on so it's not super thick and then they

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.470 
on so it's not super thick and then they
flash<00:03:17.980> fry<00:03:18.250> them<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.760> shrimp<00:03:19.000> themselves

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
flash fry them the shrimp themselves

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.870 
flash fry them the shrimp themselves
stay<00:03:19.690> tender<00:03:20.139> but<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.739> outside<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> little

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
stay tender but the outside is a little

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.430 
stay tender but the outside is a little
crispy<00:03:22.180> but<00:03:22.359> then<00:03:22.540> when<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.780> pour<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.200> sauce

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
crispy but then when you pour the sauce

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.050 
crispy but then when you pour the sauce
over<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.160> absorbs<00:03:24.639> that<00:03:24.819> sauce

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
over it it just absorbs that sauce

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.879 
over it it just absorbs that sauce
without<00:03:25.299> being<00:03:25.690> too<00:03:25.840> thick<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.350> doughy<00:03:26.530> and
