one it's now in the steaming mode all

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
one it's now in the steaming mode all
we're<00:01:26.100> doing<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.430> steaming<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> milk<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we're doing is steaming the milk I go to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
we're doing is steaming the milk I go to
the<00:01:27.900> next<00:01:28.200> level<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.610> frothing<00:01:30.119> when

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the next level and we are frothing when

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
the next level and we are frothing when
I'm<00:01:31.020> happy<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> frothing<00:01:31.979> level<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I'm happy with the frothing level or the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
I'm happy with the frothing level or the
temperature<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> steam<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
temperature I back it off to steam and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.310 
temperature I back it off to steam and
then<00:01:35.310> finish<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.240> turning<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> turning

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
then finish it off turning and turning

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.370 
then finish it off turning and turning
it<00:01:37.560> off<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.579> unlike<00:01:38.970> unlike<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it off and so unlike unlike the the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.810 
it off and so unlike unlike the the
regular<00:01:40.799> steam<00:01:41.040> wand<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.670> hand

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
regular steam wand on the right hand

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.510 
regular steam wand on the right hand
side<00:01:41.939> too<00:01:42.210> clever<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> essentially

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
side too clever this one is essentially

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
side too clever this one is essentially
it's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> hands-free<00:01:45.119> meaning<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's a hands-free meaning that we just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's a hands-free meaning that we just
submerge<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.770> steaming<00:01:47.009> pitcher<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
submerge the steaming pitcher in the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
submerge the steaming pitcher in the
nozzle<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.259> point<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:49.799> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
nozzle and at that point we don't have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
nozzle and at that point we don't have
to<00:01:50.009> hold<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> anymore<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.619> doing

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to hold it anymore so we can be doing

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
to hold it anymore so we can be doing
something<00:01:53.040> else<00:01:53.250> either<00:01:53.640> preparing<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.180> drink

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
something else either preparing to drink

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
something else either preparing to drink
or<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.950> need<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.399> watch<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
or and all we need to do is watch the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
or and all we need to do is watch the
frothy<00:01:57.240> level<00:01:57.570> kick<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> back<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> position

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
frothy level kick it back to position

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.889 
frothy level kick it back to position
one<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> finish<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.630> steaming

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
one and finish the the the steaming

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.260 
one and finish the the the steaming
level<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.399> had<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> thermometer<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
level and if we had a thermometer that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
level and if we had a thermometer that
would<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.770> tell<00:02:05.040> us<00:02:05.070> when<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
would that would tell us when the the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.839 
would that would tell us when the the
frothing<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.420> done<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> essentially<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
frothing is done and so essentially a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.199 
frothing is done and so essentially a
new<00:02:09.390> barista<00:02:10.250> can<00:02:11.250> use<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:11.819> doesn't

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
new barista can use this one doesn't

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.990 
new barista can use this one doesn't
have<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> training

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
have a lot of training

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.900 
have a lot of training
or<00:02:13.150> even<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> busy<00:02:14.470> barista<00:02:14.950> can<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.670> steaming

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
or even a busy barista can be steaming

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.300 
or even a busy barista can be steaming
two<00:02:16.120> pots<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.450> milk<00:02:16.660> at<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.810> same<00:02:17.020> time<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
two pots of milk at the same time and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.860 
two pots of milk at the same time and
multitasking<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.210> essentially<00:02:19.600> it's<00:02:19.720> almost

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
multitasking so essentially it's almost

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.870 
multitasking so essentially it's almost
like<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> third<00:02:20.320> hand<00:02:20.590> excellent<00:02:21.490> multi

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
like a third hand excellent multi

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.870 
like a third hand excellent multi
tasking<00:02:22.360> device<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.130> excellent<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.370> someone

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
tasking device and excellent for someone

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.940 
tasking device and excellent for someone
who<00:02:25.060> especially<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> barista<00:02:26.470> that's<00:02:26.680> not<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
who especially a barista that's not a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.890 
who especially a barista that's not a
mission-critical<00:02:27.520> barista<00:02:28.420> where<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.840> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
mission-critical barista where this is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.870 
mission-critical barista where this is
all<00:02:29.140> they<00:02:29.350> do<00:02:29.410> all<00:02:29.770> day<00:02:29.890> long<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.550> free

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
all they do all day long is free

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880 
all they do all day long is free
becoming<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.630> barista<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.440> an<00:02:32.530> option<00:02:32.800> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
becoming a barista so it's an option to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.490 
becoming a barista so it's an option to
consider<00:02:33.209> absolutely<00:02:34.209> great<00:02:34.810> labor-saving

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
consider absolutely great labor-saving

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.850 
consider absolutely great labor-saving
device<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:38.050> mentioned<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.410> hot<00:02:38.590> water

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
device and so we mentioned the hot water

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.010 
device and so we mentioned the hot water
button<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.540> big<00:02:40.690> soft

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020

touch button just designed for ergonomic

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.699 
touch button just designed for ergonomic
standpoint<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.260> soft<00:02:44.500> touch

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
standpoint and then the soft touch

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.620 
standpoint and then the soft touch
buttons<00:02:45.130> above<00:02:45.250> each<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.060> group<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.600> we

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
buttons above each of the group so we

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.420 
buttons above each of the group so we
have<00:02:46.840> our<00:02:46.870> programmable<00:02:47.620> buns<00:02:47.800> here<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.280> then

have our programmable buns here and then

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.620 
have our programmable buns here and then
our<00:02:50.100> programming<00:02:51.100> or<00:02:51.280> continuous<00:02:52.120> poor<00:02:52.390> but

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
our programming or continuous poor but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.900 
our programming or continuous poor but
if<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.800> machine<00:02:54.160> was<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> we're<00:02:54.880> a

if this machine was a we're a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.910 
if this machine was a we're a
semi-automatic<00:02:55.780> we<00:02:56.110> wouldn't<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.680> these

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
semi-automatic we wouldn't have these

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.160 
semi-automatic we wouldn't have these
four<00:02:57.250> buttons<00:02:57.430> would<00:02:57.850> only<00:02:58.060> have<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.110> one

and that really helps it helps see what

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.420 
and that really helps it helps see what
the<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.320> drink<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.739> looking<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.160> and

trying to profile the machine it's a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.420 
trying to profile the machine it's a
great<00:03:33.100> attention<00:03:33.940> grabber<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.600> could<00:03:34.780> appoint

great attention grabber it could appoint
this<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:37.120> mentioned<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.870> the

these steam was I think you can pretty
much<00:05:27.870> flip<00:05:28.289> up<00:05:28.469> both<00:05:28.710> steam<00:05:28.979> ones<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.580> they'll

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
much flip up both steam ones and they'll

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.269 
much flip up both steam ones and they'll
run<00:05:30.629> almost<00:05:30.839> continuously<00:05:31.560> i<00:05:31.650> would<00:05:31.889> i<00:05:32.129> would

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
run almost continuously i would i would

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.619 
run almost continuously i would i would
think<00:05:32.550> yes<00:05:33.060> remember<00:05:33.599> that<00:05:34.759> if<00:05:35.759> you<00:05:36.000> look<00:05:36.389> at

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
think yes remember that if you look at

think yes remember that if you look at
all<00:05:37.439> the<00:05:37.650> machines<00:05:37.949> available<00:05:38.069> today<00:05:38.899> the
