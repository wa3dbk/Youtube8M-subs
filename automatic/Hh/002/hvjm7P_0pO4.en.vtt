00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.869
 cooked 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.340
 so today to be cook I 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.490
 ate pauline hello pauline hello 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.680
 Hi 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.840
 ten months ago pauline you called me 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.739
 today to do what exactly 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.259
 if in fact I have a dinner tonight as 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.849
 my in the room she did a good 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.020
 dessert around the crete but whatever 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.020
 something that surprises them a little 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.370
 revisited okay a pancake surprise ok 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.879
 so the first attack we will achieve 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.770
 the pancakes 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.539
 so we have all our ingredients so we 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.039
 going to make super good pancakes with a 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.870
 little bit of rum all year round she goes 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.579
 see some nice we'll start actually at 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.960
 heat a little milk so 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.100
 if you have a pan what are you going to do 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.539
 we're going to extract the hail and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.890
 the seeds of the pod and that's it and we 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.030
 will put everything in fact in the milk is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.079
 so me what I like to do in 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.640
 does it reject a little bit of 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.289
 butter also in the milk in the dough to 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.749
 pancakes herself and it really gives a 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.489
 side minus the fondant crep very nice 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.839
 while while our milk is in 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.269
 train infuse what we will do is 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.040
 broken 3rd and we go the football is a small 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.020
 little with with a little sugar 2 that is 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.820
 a success very well fight against the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.440
 fried and to try to froth 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.720
 a little mix so your pancakes there we go 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.220
 flavor them with English rock 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.890
 english of caps now we will get 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.180
 add the flour I will put a 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 little bit of beer at the start a little 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.730
 paw 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.770
 that's just the equivalent of a background of 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.640
 glass really it will give even more 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.640
 of lightness our two legs 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.080
 there we are not bad at the level of the dm1 it is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.740
 gone so I pour you gently 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.720
 for thirty-eight so here especially 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.830
 not too hot milk so it's too much 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.410
 warm you let warm up before 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 incorporate it so if you have the time 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.310
 let your dough rest a little half 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.810
 after honestly this dough she is 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.189
 ready to use right away 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.350
 then line we attack the cooking 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.149
 ok ok so here you are trying 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.770
 warm up the awesome pancake pan 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.600
 because I propose to you it is at each 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.979
 time to put a little note bury not 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.079
 important it will really bring 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.509
 something to cream saler fed 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.909
 would have benefited it's not bad and in 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.159
 do you know when the edges start 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.869
 to take off that you can start 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.060
 yeah and you see especially at the level of 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.769
 thackeray center that's the dough and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.700
 the dough and then dry there the pancake she 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:22.269
 is good and comes knows never but 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.590
 it's good it's not the cata 1 is what 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.670
 you want us to blow up yeah we 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:37.650
 try we try to guarantee nothing yeah 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 not bad to do yes 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.900
 Oh, I'm good 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 or snack 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.980
 super we have our pretty pancakes so we go 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.420
 let it cool down quietly then 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.240
 we will take care of preparing so for 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.770
 start the similar to tiramisu so 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.970
 with the mascarpone will start with case 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.680
 it's just the eyes separate 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.490
 the whites of the yellows 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.100
 me what am I going to do if I'm going 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.630
 whisk the eggs with the sugar 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.430
 so I'll have a little bag of sugar 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.870
 vanilla sugar quietly his 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.140
 parties energetically until the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.140
 mix unfairly hockey 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.330
 I will make my room my preparation 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.880
 is very frothy you see here I 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.590
 will add the mascarpone and well 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.370
 beat all that to have a mix 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.170
 well homogeneous it's good Pauline wearing 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.730
 the plans this is the case they are good they 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.440
 are good and a little tip for 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.840
 make sure the whites are the same 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.910
 just return your bowl and site 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.320
 or not it is that they are well yeah 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.970
 it's good what you say to nothing and 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.100
 that they incorporate them into the escape 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.330
 so we often get the dough slightly going 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.830
 try to keep a maximum of small 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.200
 bubbles and why are you trying 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.540
 white one always has to turn in the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 same meaning me what I do is that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.720
 I go there gently I use a whip 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.489
 like that and I pass the dough to 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.290
 through instinctively I always do 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.540
 the same cool meaning but then we are good there 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.100
 there is a nice texture and well it's 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.709
 we will start preparing our 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.660
 chaplain so we put the pancake pretty 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.980
 side below what we will do is 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.079
 we will start to put a little bit 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.150
 cocoa inside the crib on 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.410
 put two cookies so biscuits 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.540
 they are soaked for three seconds in the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.190
 cold coffee important it is necessary that the coffee 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.930
 be cold for not that when we go 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.780
 then put the mascarpone cream 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.970
 on it it melts we will put or two 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.960
 beautiful spoon of preparation at 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 mascarpone 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.919
 we will put small crumbs 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.660
 speculoos like that would bring a little 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.250
 crisp side nice and then we go 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.660
 to make use of a little toothpick 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.289
 little wooden picks what are we going 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.990
 to do is we go so 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.369
 fold the sides of the crepe and we will 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.199
 just start we'll piss 

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.879
 an all around like that attack 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.339
 maybe this is the stage a little bit 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.110
 a little technical and a little bit 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:58.909
 delicate with small wooden picks 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.009
 we're going to go we'll apply from 2.3 to 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.509
 share in this place where steve is this 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.219
 we will do this last step is 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.839
 sprinkle with a little icing sugar 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.139
