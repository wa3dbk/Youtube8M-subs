of the technology workforce is female

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
of the technology workforce is female
and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.490> bad<00:01:29.850> enough<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> going

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and that's bad enough but it's going

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.109 
and that's bad enough but it's going
down<00:01:31.170> each<00:01:31.590> year<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> look<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
down each year and if you look at the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.149 
down each year and if you look at the
number<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> a-levels<00:01:34.020> being<00:01:34.259> taken<00:01:34.680> by<00:01:34.860> girls

number of a-levels being taken by girls

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
number of a-levels being taken by girls
it's<00:01:35.490> lower<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> lower<00:01:36.540> each<00:01:36.840> year<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it's lower and lower each year so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's lower and lower each year so
there's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> real<00:01:37.829> crisis<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.670> Little<00:01:39.329> Miss

what's<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> US<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> UK<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
what's going on in the US and the UK to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
what's going on in the US and the UK to
make<00:01:54.210> girls<00:01:55.140> still<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> problem<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.610> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
make girls still have a problem in this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
make girls still have a problem in this
area<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> second<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> all<00:01:58.020> why<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
area and second of all why is it that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.350 
area and second of all why is it that
there<00:01:59.340> isn't<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> follow-through<00:01:59.909> from

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
there isn't the follow-through from

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
there isn't the follow-through from
doing<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.899> school<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.439> getting<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> jobs

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
doing well at school to getting the jobs

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
doing well at school to getting the jobs
in<00:02:02.670> science<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.360> technology<00:02:03.479> business

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
in science and technology business

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.469 
in science and technology business
you're<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:04.979> girls<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.579> outperform<00:02:06.270> boys

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you're right girls do outperform boys

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
you're right girls do outperform boys
but<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> issue<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> biggest

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
but the issue is that one of the biggest

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.760 
but the issue is that one of the biggest
issues<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> image<00:02:09.149> problem<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> image

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
issues is the image problem so the image

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.309 
issues is the image problem so the image
of<00:02:11.039> girls<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.390> people<00:02:12.569> who<00:02:12.870> work<00:02:13.080> in

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
of girls is of people who work in

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.839 
of girls is of people who work in
technology

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849

girls like Zia to really change that

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.280 
girls like Zia to really change that
perception<00:02:25.999> because<00:02:26.450> technology<00:02:27.079> is<00:02:27.109> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
perception because technology is a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
wonderful career and that's what we need

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.990 
wonderful career and that's what we need
to<00:02:29.719> do<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.439> need<00:02:30.469> to<00:02:30.650> inspire<00:02:31.159> girls<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.609> change

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
workshop I just I just like was able to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.039 
workshop I just I just like was able to
see<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> fun<00:02:46.790> side<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.120> technology<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.870> I

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
see a fun side of technology that I

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.929 
see a fun side of technology that I
hadn't<00:02:48.379> seen<00:02:48.530> before<00:02:48.859> because<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.250> Melinda

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
hadn't seen before because as Melinda

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.149 
hadn't seen before because as Melinda
said<00:02:50.209> it's<00:02:50.359> just<00:02:50.419> like<00:02:50.719> people<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.769> sit<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
said it's just like people that sit and

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.970 
said it's just like people that sit and
watch<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.459> computer<00:02:53.359> screen<00:02:53.629> all<00:02:53.959> day<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.230> not

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
watch a computer screen all day and not

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.399 
watch a computer screen all day and not
very<00:02:55.219> cool<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.329> then<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.139> showed

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
very cool so but then when they showed

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.899 
very cool so but then when they showed
us<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.829> could<00:02:57.980> actually<00:02:58.129> be<00:02:58.370> fun<00:02:58.609> I<00:02:58.879> just

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
us that it could actually be fun I just

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.399 
us that it could actually be fun I just
thought<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.840> what<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.260> something

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
thought you know what this is something

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.500 
thought you know what this is something
that<00:03:00.709> maybe<00:03:00.859> I<00:03:01.010> want<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.340> do<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.269> have

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that maybe I want to do and you have

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.789 
that maybe I want to do and you have
done<00:03:02.719> it<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.019> big<00:03:03.169> way<00:03:03.199> I<00:03:03.349> know<00:03:03.560> you've

at sensei visions and allows my school
and<00:03:11.419> we<00:03:11.870> started<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.379> project<00:03:12.560> called<00:03:12.919> apps<00:03:13.129> for

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
and we started a project called apps for

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.119 
and we started a project called apps for
good<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.540> had<00:03:14.719> to<00:03:14.840> do<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.409> had<00:03:15.439> to<00:03:15.590> create<00:03:16.010> a

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
good and we had to do we had to create a

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.569 
good and we had to do we had to create a
app<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.750> would<00:03:18.049> solve<00:03:18.259> a<00:03:18.409> problem<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:18.919> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
app that would solve a problem and the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.699 
app that would solve a problem and the
the<00:03:20.120> app<00:03:20.269> me<00:03:20.479> and<00:03:20.659> my<00:03:20.750> friend<00:03:20.989> created<00:03:21.500> was

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the app me and my friend created was

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.610 
the app me and my friend created was
about<00:03:21.979> recycling<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.659> is<00:03:24.049> actually<00:03:24.470> gone

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
about recycling and it is actually gone

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.059 
about recycling and it is actually gone
very<00:03:24.889> far<00:03:25.159> away<00:03:25.280> we're<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:26.739> carrying<00:03:27.739> on

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
very far away we're just carrying on

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.300 
very far away we're just carrying on
building<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.090> now<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:30.530> sounds<00:03:30.709> fabulous<00:03:30.979> I
