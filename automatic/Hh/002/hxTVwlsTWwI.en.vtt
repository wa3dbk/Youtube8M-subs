00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 hi everyone had the room i hope that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.609
 you're fine today I'm going to you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.560
 show how to win almost instantly 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.590
 sure all your fights with good bare hands 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.760
 after if your friend has he has all his 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.130
 life and you have more life after 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360
 it's a bit warmer to close but 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 otherwise most of the time here you are 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 have to win all your fights so there 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.440
 as you see he is still trying to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 defend themselves they are 3 against me and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.420
 by doing the technique that I you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.190
 explained down I can kill them so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.809
 what to do so there I you 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 shows when they defend themselves after I 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.829
 will show you when they are defending themselves 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 not for that so that you see what 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.270
 so it gives the way there he will do it 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 on me for you to see 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 from another point of view this is it 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 chained the lines at a speed that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 abused so we do not have time to get 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.159
 defending in fact even if we purr 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 we do not have time to defend ourselves 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.830
 so here it's me who makes him like 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 you see he is taking rights in 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.000
 same time he is tilted back 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.680
 so he can not he can do anything 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.740
 then the technique is simple 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 you go to the guy you're staying 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 pressed increases and after and you press 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.650
 non-stop on the trigger 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.790
 so the clack clac on the trigger but 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.619
 especially you hold all the time 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 grows and you put the joystick towards 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.829
 him for your player to tap towards 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.509
 he watched him he defends himself and yet 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.130
 he will not put a lot of blows and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.350
 mekhut actually they are faster 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 than hers but there was not the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.200
 technique it was me who did it and there 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.670
 we do the opposite 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.259
 the him will do the technique and I 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 not going to do it and look at what 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.640
 that gives I try but his shots they 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.840
 are faster so there are some 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.430
 maybe one or two who passes but 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 otherwise it's mostly 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.600
 his passing 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.010
 I hope this tip will help you 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.060
 win all your fights and me I you 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.060
 say to the next ciao
