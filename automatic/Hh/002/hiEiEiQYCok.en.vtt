00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hey how's it going my name is Dan I've

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.459 
hey how's it going my name is Dan I've
done<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.090> other<00:00:09.210> videos<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:09.809> far<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.349> new

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
done one other videos so far on the new

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.129 
done one other videos so far on the new
car<00:00:11.330> which<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> 1973<00:00:13.469> datsun<00:00:14.219> 240z<00:00:15.139> yeah

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
car which is the 1973 datsun 240z yeah

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.140 
car which is the 1973 datsun 240z yeah
like<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> heck<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.340> custom<00:00:18.920> anyway<00:00:20.119> got<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
like the heck it was custom anyway got a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
like the heck it was custom anyway got a
little<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.510> farther<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.560> transmission

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
little bit farther the transmission

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.880 
little bit farther the transmission
which<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> original<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.359> speed<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.890> was

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
which is the original for speed I was

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.070 
which is the original for speed I was
toast<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.230> we<00:00:28.230> went<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.650> stuck<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.220> 280zx

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
toast so we went in and stuck in a 280zx

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.700 
toast so we went in and stuck in a 280zx
transmission<00:00:31.080> five-speed<00:00:33.440> hold<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
transmission five-speed hold on one

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
transmission five-speed hold on one
minute<00:00:36.260> all<00:00:37.260> right<00:00:38.090> now<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> best

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
minute all right now the best

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.860 
minute all right now the best
transmission<00:00:40.890> swap<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.340> 240<00:00:41.790> Z<00:00:41.969> 2<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> 5<00:00:42.480> speed

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
transmission swap for 240 Z 2 of 5 speed

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.310 
transmission swap for 240 Z 2 of 5 speed
is<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> transmission<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> 1981

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
is to get a transmission from the 1981

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.389 
is to get a transmission from the 1981
through<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> 1983<00:00:47.550> 280zx<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.280> this

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
through a 1983 280zx the reason for this

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.630 
through a 1983 280zx the reason for this
is<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:51.890> everything<00:00:52.890> lines<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.309> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
is because everything lines up one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.410 
is because everything lines up one
hundred<00:00:54.030> percent<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.660> okay<00:00:55.520> perfectly<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.820> mean

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
hundred percent a okay perfectly I mean

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.250 
hundred percent a okay perfectly I mean
the<00:00:57.960> shifters<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> correct<00:00:58.890> spot<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it bolts straight up to the motor as it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.000 
it bolts straight up to the motor as it
should<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.360> lines<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> original<00:01:10.590> place

for<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.280> transmission<00:01:11.580> crossmember<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
for the transmission crossmember the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170 
for the transmission crossmember the
reason<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> 75<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> 80<00:01:14.310> g<00:01:14.549> transmission

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
reason like a 75 to 80 g transmission

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
reason like a 75 to 80 g transmission
will<00:01:15.299> work<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.750> least<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.290> hypothesis

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
will work at least this is my hypothesis

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.390 
will work at least this is my hypothesis
is<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.920> point<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.310> they

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
is that I know it's one point when they

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.679 
is that I know it's one point when they
started<00:01:20.729> messing<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> fifth<00:01:21.450> gear

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
started messing with the fifth gear

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.710 
started messing with the fifth gear
overdrive<00:01:21.960> transmissions<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:24.390> had<00:01:24.509> something

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
overdrive transmissions it had something

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
overdrive transmissions it had something
to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.080> adding<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.500> extra<00:01:25.590> spindle<00:01:26.100> for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to do with adding an extra spindle for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.679 
to do with adding an extra spindle for
the<00:01:26.369> fifth<00:01:26.549> gear<00:01:26.790> meshing<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the fifth gear meshing it in with the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.120 
the fifth gear meshing it in with the
reverse<00:01:27.900> gear<00:01:28.140> spindle<00:01:28.530> life<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.799> forget

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
reverse gear spindle life I forget

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
reverse gear spindle life I forget
exactly<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.900> eventually<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.229> made<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
exactly but eventually they made a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.660 
exactly but eventually they made a
change<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.430> caused

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
change like that that caused

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.640 
change like that that caused
transmission<00:01:33.390> dimensions<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> change<00:01:35.360> so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
transmission dimensions to change so

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.550 
transmission dimensions to change so
anyway<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:39.479> car<00:01:39.720> also<00:01:39.869> runs<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.470> bit

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
anyway the car also runs a little bit

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 
anyway the car also runs a little bit
better<00:01:40.680> than<00:01:40.950> playing<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> timing<00:01:41.790> for

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
better than playing with the timing for

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.160 
better than playing with the timing for
those<00:01:42.060> either<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.630> timing<00:01:42.899> these

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
those either know about timing these

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
those either know about timing these
things<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.619> don't<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.880> don't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
things I don't know what it is I don't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.100 
things I don't know what it is I don't
know<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> guys<00:01:45.360> had<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:45.600> luck<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> me

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
know if you guys had better luck to me

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
know if you guys had better luck to me
I'm<00:01:46.200> used<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> big<00:01:46.680> old<00:01:46.860> American<00:01:47.399> numbers

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I'm used to big old American numbers

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.590 
I'm used to big old American numbers
just<00:01:48.180> listed<00:01:48.509> right<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> pan<00:01:49.259> but

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
just listed right there on the pan but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.609 
just listed right there on the pan but
apparently<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> same<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.320> for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
apparently it's not the same way for

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.740 
apparently it's not the same way for
these<00:01:52.770> guys

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:32.540 

starts<00:01:56.750> right<00:01:56.900> up

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:46.880 

haha

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.680 

my<00:02:47.890> dad<00:02:48.070> says<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.370> shouldn't<00:02:48.670> do<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.150> but<00:02:49.450> I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
my dad says that shouldn't do that but I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.040 
my dad says that shouldn't do that but I
like<00:02:50.350> hearing<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.300> bad<00:02:52.450> i<00:02:52.510> understand

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
like hearing it it is bad i understand

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.250 
like hearing it it is bad i understand
that<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:53.290> i<00:02:53.710> had<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.130> get<00:02:54.310> down<00:02:54.430> video<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
that but i had to get down video the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.400 
that but i had to get down video the
risk<00:02:56.500> got<00:02:56.680> home<00:02:56.920> would<00:02:57.100> take<00:02:59.190> any<00:03:00.190> way<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:01.410> see

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
risk got home would take any way I see

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.050 
risk got home would take any way I see
if<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.650> prop<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.490> somewhere
