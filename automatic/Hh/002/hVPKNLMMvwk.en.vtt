doesn't have too much bad nutrients in

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.180 
doesn't have too much bad nutrients in
it<00:05:30.849> it<00:05:31.000> just<00:05:31.030> makes<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:31.960> spicy<00:05:32.530> easier<00:05:32.889> to<00:05:32.979> eat

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
eventually record thermogenesis which

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.850 
eventually record thermogenesis which
means<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.599> burns<00:05:45.150> calories<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:49.570> that's<00:05:50.199> all<00:05:50.560> it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
means it burns calories so that's all it
