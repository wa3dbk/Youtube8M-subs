00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
over the hole from here on in we fill it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
over the hole from here on in we fill it
with<00:01:43.079> compost<00:01:43.229> okay<00:01:43.920> let's<00:01:44.250> do<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:46.880> break<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
with compost okay let's do it break it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.130 
with compost okay let's do it break it
up<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:48.810> sometimes

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
up as you put it in because sometimes

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
up as you put it in because sometimes
you'll<00:01:49.259> find<00:01:49.530> lumps<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> compost<00:01:50.549> okay

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you'll find lumps in the compost okay

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
you'll find lumps in the compost okay
how<00:01:51.210> deep<00:01:51.420> should<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.840> planting<00:01:52.200> above

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
how deep should you be planting above

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
how deep should you be planting above
them<00:01:52.590> we're<00:01:52.740> both<00:01:52.890> bulbs<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> plant

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
them we're both bulbs you have to plant

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
them we're both bulbs you have to plant
them<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.060> three<00:01:54.509> times<00:01:54.689> their<00:01:54.960> depth<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
them about three times their depth so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.990 
them about three times their depth so
look<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> size<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.759> plant<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
look at the size of that and plant it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.639 
look at the size of that and plant it
three<00:01:57.240> times<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.659> deep<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> be

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
three times as deep but you have to be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
three times as deep but you have to be
guided<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:59.009> variety<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.820> some<00:02:00.090> bulbs<00:02:00.299> have

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
guided by variety as some bulbs have

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
guided by variety as some bulbs have
quite<00:02:00.899> specific<00:02:01.320> needs<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:02.040> may<00:02:02.250> sound<00:02:02.460> simple

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
quite specific needs it may sound simple

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.609 
quite specific needs it may sound simple
but<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.659> need<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.869> plant<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> bulb<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> right

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
but you need to plant the bulb the right

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.130 
but you need to plant the bulb the right
way<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.920> yes<00:02:05.430> well<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> flat<00:02:06.600> side<00:02:06.840> where

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
way up yes well this the flat side where

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
way up yes well this the flat side where
these<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.469> roots<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.890> indicates<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
these little roots are indicates the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.580 
these little roots are indicates the
bottom<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.500> this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bottom what I'm going to do with this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.650 
bottom what I'm going to do with this
pot<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.160> rather<00:02:11.670> than<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.879> put<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
pot is rather than just put one right in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
pot is rather than just put one right in
the<00:02:12.690> center<00:02:13.170> I've

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the center I've

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
the center I've
rufa<00:02:14.010> three<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.330> be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
rufa three in here you can they can be

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
rufa three in here you can they can be
quite<00:02:15.600> close<00:02:15.810> together<00:02:16.020> just<00:02:16.770> make<00:02:16.920> sure

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
quite close together just make sure

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
quite close together just make sure
they're<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.310> touching<00:02:17.820> because<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.330> can

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
they're not touching because that can

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.450 
they're not touching because that can
lead<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.630> rotting<00:02:19.050> now<00:02:19.740> all<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.250> is

lead to rotting now all I have to do is

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.410 
lead to rotting now all I have to do is
fill<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> we've<00:02:23.580> dealt<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> pots

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
fill it up so we've dealt with the pots

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.310 
again to have the ramblings I down and
the<00:04:17.670> roots<00:04:17.940> down<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.390> well<00:04:18.540> with<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.690> bulb<00:04:18.959> yep

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the roots down is well with the bulb yep

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.860 
the roots down is well with the bulb yep
absolutely<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.820> next<00:04:21.030> level<00:04:21.359> nail<00:04:21.540> then<00:04:21.720> we'll

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
absolutely so next level nail then we'll

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.390 
absolutely so next level nail then we'll
go<00:04:22.470> go<00:04:23.160> for<00:04:23.400> our<00:04:23.570> daffodils<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.660> i'm<00:04:24.780> using

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
go go for our daffodils and i'm using

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.590 
go go for our daffodils and i'm using
narcissus<00:04:26.400> tete-a-tete<00:04:26.910> with

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
narcissus tete-a-tete with

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.670 
narcissus tete-a-tete with
a<00:04:28.130> mid<00:04:29.130> spring<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.670> deaths<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.680> our

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
a mid spring for the deaths and our

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.980 
a mid spring for the deaths and our
tulips<00:04:32.190> will<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.520> later<00:04:33.150> her<00:04:33.510> irises<00:04:33.930> are

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
tulips will be later her irises are

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.260 
tulips will be later her irises are
quite<00:04:34.650> early<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.190> Nick's<00:04:35.580> level<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.910> soil<00:04:36.120> than

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
quite early in Nick's level of soil than

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.050 
quite early in Nick's level of soil than
I<00:04:36.300> guess<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:38.610> we<00:04:38.700> go<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:41.070> then<00:04:41.880> we're<00:04:41.970> going

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
I guess there we go and then we're going

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.940 
I guess there we go and then we're going
to<00:04:42.120> finish<00:04:42.300> up<00:04:42.600> with<00:04:43.020> our<00:04:43.170> smallest<00:04:43.470> bulbs

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
to finish up with our smallest bulbs

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.280 
to finish up with our smallest bulbs
