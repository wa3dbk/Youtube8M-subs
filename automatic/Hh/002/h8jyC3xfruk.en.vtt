we<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.349> know<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.679> earthworms<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.700> causing

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
we now know that earthworms are causing

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.439 
we now know that earthworms are causing
significant<00:00:16.049> damage<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.500> some<00:00:16.920> forests<00:00:17.550> the

significant damage to some forests the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
significant damage to some forests the
problem<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.140> they're<00:00:19.619> destroying<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.520> soil

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
problem is they're destroying the soil

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.509 
problem is they're destroying the soil
cover<00:00:21.350> native<00:00:22.350> plant<00:00:22.680> communities<00:00:23.279> are

cover native plant communities are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
cover native plant communities are
disappearing<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> habitat<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.130> a

disappearing and so is the habitat for a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.089 
disappearing and so is the habitat for a
lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.910> different<00:00:27.269> animals<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> because

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lot of different animals it's because

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
lot of different animals it's because
earthworms<00:00:29.730> change<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.570> structure<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> the

earthworms change the structure of the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
earthworms change the structure of the
soil<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.890> change<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:32.969> nutrients<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.660> cycled

soil and change how nutrients are cycled
it's<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.110> such

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it's because of this that they have such

it's because of this that they have such
