00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
golden brown the reason why I got a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020 
golden brown the reason why I got a
lighter<00:01:38.930> color<00:01:39.160> because<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.370> top<00:01:40.610> part<00:01:40.910> of<00:01:40.970> my

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
lighter color because the top part of my

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.570 
lighter color because the top part of my
hair<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.630> light<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.140> my<00:01:42.770> sister<00:01:43.190> which

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
hair is really light and my sister which

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.150 
hair is really light and my sister which
she<00:01:44.540> knows<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.780> lot<00:01:44.960> about<00:01:45.020> extensions<00:01:45.590> told<00:01:46.010> me

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
she knows a lot about extensions told me

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.810 
she knows a lot about extensions told me
to<00:01:46.310> match<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.760> top<00:01:46.970> color<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.450> my<00:01:47.570> hair<00:01:47.600> um<00:01:48.820> yes

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
to match the top color of my hair um yes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.540 
to match the top color of my hair um yes
so<00:01:50.300> that's<00:01:50.870> why<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.050> chose<00:01:51.260> that<00:01:51.440> color<00:01:51.650> so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
so that's why I chose that color so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.500 
so that's why I chose that color so
anyway<00:01:52.790> I'm<00:01:52.910> just<00:01:53.150> putting<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
anyway I'm just putting it in here and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.450 
anyway I'm just putting it in here and
it's<00:01:56.510> pretty<00:01:56.780> easy<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.440> be<00:01:57.710> honest<00:01:58.160> like<00:01:58.220> it's

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
it's pretty easy to be honest like it's

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.010 
it's pretty easy to be honest like it's
a<00:01:58.490> lot<00:01:58.670> easier<00:01:58.820> than<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.240> thought<00:01:59.300> especially

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
a lot easier than I thought especially

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.060 
a lot easier than I thought especially
for<00:02:00.110> someone<00:02:00.170> who's<00:02:00.500> never<00:02:00.530> done<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.980> before

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
for someone who's never done it before

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.420 
for someone who's never done it before

all for the back

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.080 
all for the back
and<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.170> 42<00:02:34.170> inch<00:02:34.200> clip-ins<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.850> them

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090

in the front so I used to the small ones
on<00:02:39.959> each<00:02:40.170> side<00:02:40.440> which<00:02:40.680> you'll<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:41.000> later<00:02:42.319> on

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319

as<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.400> see<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.940> putting<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
as you can see I'm just putting the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.660 
as you can see I'm just putting the
clippings<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.990> now<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> like

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
clippings in the back now what I like

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.910 
clippings in the back now what I like
about<00:02:50.700> these<00:02:51.060> clippings<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.959> hair<00:02:52.290> felt<00:02:52.680> very

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
about these clippings the hair felt very

about these clippings the hair felt very
natural<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.790> me<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> guess<00:02:54.240> because<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
natural to me I guess because it is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.280 
natural to me I guess because it is
human<00:02:55.410> hair<00:02:55.800> Indian<00:02:56.490> hair<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.080> felt

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
human hair Indian hair but it felt

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.110 
human hair Indian hair but it felt
really<00:02:58.560> natural<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:59.100> me<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.520> hair<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.000> very

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
the fact that the color matched the top

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.300 
the fact that the color matched the top
of<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:07.980> hair<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:09.570> was<00:03:09.720> pretty<00:03:09.900> close<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.680> it

trying to make it blend but it was a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.830 
trying to make it blend but it was a
little<00:03:59.370> difficult<00:03:59.579> for<00:03:59.820> me<00:03:59.970> because<00:04:00.329> like<00:04:00.570> I

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
little difficult for me because like I

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.810 
little difficult for me because like I
said<00:04:00.989> my<00:04:01.500> hair<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.769> really<00:04:02.010> weird<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.549> just

so<00:04:02.970> thick<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:04.170> would<00:04:04.680> need<00:04:04.829> more<00:04:05.280> hair<00:04:05.700> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
so thick that I would need more hair to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.050 
so thick that I would need more hair to
blend<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.530> roots<00:04:07.860> don't<00:04:08.190> look<00:04:08.430> so

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
blend in so that the roots don't look so

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.759 
blend in so that the roots don't look so
thick<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.750> top<00:04:09.989> portion<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.530> my<00:04:10.620> hair

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
thick in the top portion of my hair

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.220 
thick in the top portion of my hair
thick<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.430> bottom<00:04:12.239> portion<00:04:12.390> my<00:04:12.690> hair<00:04:12.989> you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
thick and the bottom portion my hair you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.370 
thick and the bottom portion my hair you
know<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.769> extension<00:04:14.280> part<00:04:14.549> um<00:04:15.049> thin<00:04:16.049> like

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
know the extension part um thin like

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.409 
know the extension part um thin like
you'll<00:04:16.530> go<00:04:16.680> from<00:04:16.799> thick<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.220> thin<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.640> know<00:04:17.669> so

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
you'll go from thick to thin you know so

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.969 
you'll go from thick to thin you know so
for<00:04:18.660> some<00:04:18.810> people<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:19.289> pack<00:04:19.560> would<00:04:19.769> work

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
for some people one pack would work

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.090 
for some people one pack would work
perfectly<00:04:21.019> personally<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.079> think<00:04:22.140> for<00:04:22.530> me<00:04:22.560> two

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
perfectly personally I think for me two

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.640 
perfectly personally I think for me two
packs<00:04:23.340> would<00:04:23.700> work<00:04:23.940> much<00:04:24.150> better<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
packs would work much better so in the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.590 
packs would work much better so in the
future<00:04:25.800> I'm<00:04:26.250> probably<00:04:26.520> gonna<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.150> maybe

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
future I'm probably gonna like maybe

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.570 
future I'm probably gonna like maybe
purchase<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.289> second<00:04:28.740> pack<00:04:28.890> because<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.250> really
