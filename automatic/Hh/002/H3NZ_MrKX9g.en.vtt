want<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.469> holes<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> bottom<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
want to put holes in the bottom and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.900 
want to put holes in the bottom and
basically<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.840> use<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.170> 5/16<00:02:08.160> type<00:02:08.580> bit

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
basically you can use a 5/16 type bit

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.180 
basically you can use a 5/16 type bit
