this the mouth right here now if I were

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.680 
this the mouth right here now if I were
to<00:00:54.300> connect<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> mouth<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to connect the mouth then this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
to connect the mouth then this
centerpiece<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:59.160> come<00:00:59.399> loose<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.149> then

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
centerpiece would come loose and then

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
centerpiece would come loose and then
every<00:01:00.719> time<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.050> print<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> put

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
every time I print I would have to put

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.850 
every time I print I would have to put
it<00:01:02.399> down<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.969> position<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> try<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> make

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it down and position it and try to make

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
it down and position it and try to make
sure<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.159> doesn't<00:01:05.339> move<00:01:05.659> since<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.869> don't<00:01:07.110> want

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sure it doesn't move since I don't want

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
sure it doesn't move since I don't want
to<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.799> hassle<00:01:08.150> I'm<00:01:09.150> gonna

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.350 
to go through that hassle I'm gonna
leave<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.290> strip<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.360> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
leave this little strip right here just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.870 
leave this little strip right here just

gonna want to be very careful with your
edges<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.810> cutting<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.920> not

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
edges if you're cutting out and it's not

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
edges if you're cutting out and it's not
even<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.090> over<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.830> want

that you want to be nice and round

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
that you want to be nice and round
because<00:01:33.750> there's<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> tendency<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.740> things<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because there's a tendency for things to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.780 
because there's a tendency for things to
come<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:35.610> choppy<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.479> squarish<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> want

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
come out choppy and squarish so you want

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.429 
come out choppy and squarish so you want
to<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.030> ahead<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> round<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.869> each<00:01:40.110> edge

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
to go ahead and round out each edge

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.719 
to go ahead and round out each edge
after<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.250> done<00:01:43.100> or<00:01:44.100> square<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> out

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
after you're done or square it out

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.370 
after you're done or square it out
whatever<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.259> if

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
whatever it is that you want but if

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
whatever it is that you want but if
you're<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.890> something<00:01:47.040> round<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you're going for something round it's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
you're going for something round it's
gonna<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:48.000> difficult<00:01:48.500> once<00:01:49.500> you've<00:01:49.740> cut<00:01:50.040> out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
gonna be difficult once you've cut out

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
gonna be difficult once you've cut out
your<00:01:50.220> design<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.540> place<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.079> top<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
your design you can place it on top of a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
your design you can place it on top of a
table<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.220> anything<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> different

table or anything that has a different
color<00:01:54.540> underneath<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
color underneath and this is going to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249 
color underneath and this is going to
give<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> an<00:01:56.610> idea<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.780> print<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
give you an idea of what your print is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
give you an idea of what your print is
gonna<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.430> done<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
gonna look like when it's done this is a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.899 
gonna look like when it's done this is a
good<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> tell<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.979> need<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.310> cut<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
good way to tell if you need to cut a
