00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.740 

I<00:00:52.630> was<00:00:53.630> using<00:00:53.780> blender<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:55.910> design<00:00:56.390> in

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
I was using blender to do this design in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.810 
I was using blender to do this design in
3d<00:00:58.060> creating<00:00:59.060> all<00:00:59.240> the<00:00:59.420> parts<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:01.670> was

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
3d creating all the parts and it was

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.180 
3d creating all the parts and it was
quite<00:01:02.330> tricky<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.810> size<00:01:03.320> them<00:01:03.650> properly<00:01:04.070> so

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
quite tricky to size them properly so

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.550 
quite tricky to size them properly so
that<00:01:04.370> they<00:01:04.729> fit<00:01:05.000> well<00:01:05.330> together<00:01:05.630> after

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
that they fit well together after

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.510 
that they fit well together after
printing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.620 

here<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.299> an<00:01:13.450> example<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.770> see<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.630> gear

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
here is an example you can see the gear

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.770 
here is an example you can see the gear
for<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> poly<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.399> mesh<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:22.060> consists

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
for the poly it is a mesh that consists

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.109 
for the poly it is a mesh that consists
of<00:01:22.869> many<00:01:23.259> many<00:01:23.590> many<00:01:23.920> vertices<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.430> mesh<00:01:27.670> was

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
of many many many vertices the mesh was

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.340 
of many many many vertices the mesh was
exported<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.289> 3d<00:01:30.280> printing<00:01:30.789> software<00:01:31.350> which

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
exported to a 3d printing software which

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.029 
exported to a 3d printing software which
creates<00:01:32.860> layers<00:01:33.700> by<00:01:34.179> layers<00:01:34.479> lines<00:01:35.259> by<00:01:35.740> lines

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
creates layers by layers lines by lines

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.740 
creates layers by layers lines by lines
and<00:01:37.500> finally<00:01:38.500> here<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.310> 3d<00:01:39.789> view<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.570> can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
and finally here in the 3d view you can

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.910 
and finally here in the 3d view you can
see<00:01:40.960> all<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.380> lines<00:01:41.590> together<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:44.080> lines<00:01:44.350> are

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
see all the lines together the lines are

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.719 
see all the lines together the lines are
then<00:01:45.429> transferred<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.569> 3d<00:01:46.929> printer<00:01:47.729> which

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
then transferred to the 3d printer which

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.120 
then transferred to the 3d printer which
prints<00:01:49.240> very<00:01:49.539> thin<00:01:49.810> layers<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.289> approximately

and<00:02:13.870> here<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.410> can<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.220> printing<00:02:15.700> bed

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and here you can see the printing bed

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.680 
and here you can see the printing bed
moving<00:02:16.630> slowly<00:02:17.140> downwards<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.880> finally<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
moving slowly downwards and finally the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.710 
moving slowly downwards and finally the
result<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.470> pulley<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.720> very

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
result the pulley here a very

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.870 
result the pulley here a very
interesting<00:02:23.079> moment<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.859> is<00:02:24.130> when<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.609> time

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
interesting moment and is when it's time

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.979 
interesting moment and is when it's time
to<00:02:24.930> remove<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.140> part<00:02:26.440> from<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:27.010> print<00:02:27.310> bed

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
to remove the part from the print bed

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.840 
to remove the part from the print bed
actually<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.109> the<00:02:29.320> most<00:02:29.620> dangerous<00:02:30.250> part<00:02:30.670> of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
actually it's the most dangerous part of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.630 
actually it's the most dangerous part of
the<00:02:31.060> work<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.769> have<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.100> careful

and<00:03:11.960> hours<00:03:12.610> here<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> pulley<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:16.040> five

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
and hours here is the pulley with five

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.010 
and hours here is the pulley with five
screws<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.120> attach<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.480> gear<00:03:22.840> finally<00:03:23.840> need

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
screws to attach the gear finally need

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.950 
screws to attach the gear finally need
to<00:03:24.200> fit<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.620> six<00:03:24.980> axes<00:03:25.670> at<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.210> same<00:03:26.510> time

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
to fit in six axes at the same time

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.960 
to fit in six axes at the same time
which<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.470> pretty<00:03:28.430> tricky<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:30.770> fit<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.730> top

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
which is pretty tricky to fit the top

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.500 
which is pretty tricky to fit the top
frame<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.740> because<00:03:34.100> all<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.760> six<00:03:35.030> axes

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
frame on it because all the six axes

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.360 
frame on it because all the six axes
need<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.960> fit<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.680> same<00:03:36.920> moment<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
need to fit at the same moment the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.960 
need to fit at the same moment the
frames<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.150> hold<00:03:38.510> together<00:03:38.720> with<00:03:39.050> two<00:03:39.230> screws

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
frames to hold together with two screws

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.970 
frames to hold together with two screws
and<00:03:40.970> needs<00:03:41.270> an<00:03:41.420> additional<00:03:41.690> four<00:03:42.200> screws<00:03:42.590> for

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
and needs an additional four screws for

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.330 
and needs an additional four screws for
the<00:03:43.100> clock<00:03:43.340> face

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.110 

and<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:49.150> almost<00:03:49.510> done<00:03:52.530> finally<00:03:53.530> need<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.160> put

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and it's almost done finally need to put

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.290 
and it's almost done finally need to put
together<00:03:55.390> some<00:03:55.870> pieces<00:03:56.200> for<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.800> wait<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
together some pieces for the wait the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.500 
together some pieces for the wait the
crank<00:03:59.700> using<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.819> crank<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:03.520> lift<00:04:03.849> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
crank using the crank now to lift the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.479 
crank using the crank now to lift the
weight<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.530> weight<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:06.010> not<00:04:06.220> yet<00:04:06.550> attached

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
weight the weight is not yet attached

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.230 
weight the weight is not yet attached
what<00:04:09.489> I'm<00:04:09.760> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.269> attach<00:04:10.599> it<00:04:10.630> now

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.400 

and<00:04:14.720> it's<00:04:15.680> running

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.250 

now<00:04:22.370> we<00:04:22.430> can<00:04:22.880> see<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.300> clock<00:04:23.570> running<00:04:23.990> at

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
now we can see the clock running at

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.530 
now we can see the clock running at
actual<00:04:24.770> speed<00:04:26.830> I'm<00:04:27.830> using<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.400> printed<00:04:28.850> crank

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
actual speed I'm using the printed crank

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.920 
actual speed I'm using the printed crank
to<00:04:30.140> lift<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.800> weight<00:04:31.570> finally<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.690> weight

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
to lift the weight finally the weight

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.320 
to lift the weight finally the weight
adds<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.950> energy<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.700> keep<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.120> clock

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
adds the energy to keep the clock

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.620 
adds the energy to keep the clock
running<00:04:35.390> when<00:04:36.050> it's<00:04:36.290> slowly<00:04:36.590> moving<00:04:36.770> down

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.630 

clock<00:04:41.630> runs<00:04:41.870> pretty<00:04:42.380> accurate<00:04:42.950> within<00:04:43.490> an

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
clock runs pretty accurate within an

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.050 
clock runs pretty accurate within an
hour

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
hour

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.690 
hour
I<00:04:44.300> couldn't<00:04:45.200> measure<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.830> second<00:04:46.460> of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
I couldn't measure a second of

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.170 
I couldn't measure a second of
difference<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:48.520> with<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.670> weight<00:04:49.910> of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
difference and with the weight of

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.230 
difference and with the weight of
approximately<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:51.500> 70<00:04:51.980> centimetres<00:04:52.700> height

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
approximately a 70 centimetres height

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.680 
approximately a 70 centimetres height
above<00:04:53.630> ground<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:54.410> runs<00:04:54.680> approximately<00:04:55.690> two

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
above ground it runs approximately two

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.590 
above ground it runs approximately two
hours<00:04:56.720> until<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:58.100> touching<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.640> floor

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.270 

as<00:05:02.600> initially<00:05:03.230> mentioned<00:05:03.500> it<00:05:03.830> was<00:05:03.980> pretty

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
as initially mentioned it was pretty

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.110 
as initially mentioned it was pretty
tricky<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:04.970> fit<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.630> parts<00:05:05.990> together<00:05:06.200> and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
tricky to fit the parts together and

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.490 
tricky to fit the parts together and
design<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.300> properly<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.020> took<00:05:09.260> me

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
design it properly so it took me

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.710 
design it properly so it took me
approximately<00:05:09.950> 100<00:05:10.870> experiments<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:12.590> create

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
approximately 100 experiments to create

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.210 
approximately 100 experiments to create
finally<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.930> box<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:16.040> garbage

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.700 

so<00:05:21.220> this<00:05:21.430> was<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:21.760> short<00:05:21.970> o'clock<00:05:22.330> story<00:05:22.710> time

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
so this was my short o'clock story time

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.510 
so this was my short o'clock story time
is<00:05:23.889> over<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.430> thanks<00:05:25.330> for<00:05:25.449> watching
