that the two main choices a small-block
Ford<00:00:13.469> small-block<00:00:14.219> Chevy<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:15.299> they're

Ford small-block Chevy because they're

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.990 
Ford small-block Chevy because they're
plentiful<00:00:15.809> they're<00:00:16.710> affordable<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.670> can

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
plentiful they're affordable and you can

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.570 
plentiful they're affordable and you can
get<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.539> serious<00:00:19.109> power<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:20.010> but

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
get some serious power out of them but

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120 
get some serious power out of them but
when<00:00:20.820> GM<00:00:21.119> came<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.810> with<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> LS<00:00:22.500> platform

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
when GM came out with the LS platform

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
when GM came out with the LS platform
well<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.820> took<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> small-block<00:00:24.510> Chevy<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
well that took the small-block Chevy to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
well that took the small-block Chevy to
a<00:00:25.199> whole<00:00:25.439> nother<00:00:25.619> level<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.789> prompted

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
a whole nother level and that prompted

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
a whole nother level and that prompted

a p38 level this is a project that that
I<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> started<00:00:36.690> thinking<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
I really I started thinking about it in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
I really I started thinking about it in
the<00:00:37.739> 70s<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.750> six<00:00:40.290> or<00:00:40.440> eight

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the 70s but you know about six or eight

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
the 70s but you know about six or eight
years<00:00:40.739> ago<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.489> built<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> patterns

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
years ago we actually built the patterns

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.869 
years ago we actually built the patterns
for<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> we've<00:00:42.570> been<00:00:42.719> testing<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.469> while

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
for it we've been testing it for a while

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.170 
for it we've been testing it for a while
it's<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> short<00:00:46.980> story<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> it's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it's you know the short story is it's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's you know the short story is it's

you can have coffee build you a complete
crate<00:00:56.100> engine<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.850> great<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:58.020> if

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
crate engine and that's great but if

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
crate engine and that's great but if
you're<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> little<00:00:58.739> tighter<00:00:59.010> budget<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.699> if

what<00:01:17.759> makes<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.780> better<00:01:19.080> than<00:01:19.320> all

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
what makes these so much better than all

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
what makes these so much better than all
the<00:01:19.619> thousands<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> other<00:01:20.640> small-block<00:01:21.119> heads

the thousands of other small-block heads

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
the thousands of other small-block heads
out<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.740> cheaper

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
out there because there are cheaper

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
out there because there are cheaper
heads<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:24.000> let's<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> look<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.470> increase

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
heads well let's take a look to increase

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
heads well let's take a look to increase

valves that are seated deeply into the

valves that are seated deeply into the
head<00:01:31.049> by<00:01:31.799> angling<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> valves<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
head by angling the valves this way it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
head by angling the valves this way it
allows<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> fuel<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> dump<00:01:34.890> toward<00:01:35.250> the

bowls allow the valve to open more all
of<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> results<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:40.979> flow<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.700> more

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of this results in more flow and more

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
of this results in more flow and more
power<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> last<00:01:43.619> 20<00:01:44.009> years<00:01:44.180> racing

power really in the last 20 years racing

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
power really in the last 20 years racing
had<00:01:45.299> people<00:01:45.540> figured<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
had people figured out pretty well that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.039 
had people figured out pretty well that
you<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> move<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> intake

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you know they like to move the intake

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.630 
you know they like to move the intake
valve<00:01:49.290> away<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> cylinder<00:01:50.130> wall<00:01:50.340> and

Canada<00:01:51.149> valves<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.990> than<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
Canada valves are a little better than a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
and those are some of the things that we

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.290 
and those are some of the things that we
did<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:58.950> head<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> lot<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
did to that head you can make a lot of

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.520 
did to that head you can make a lot of

if<00:02:11.340> you'll<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.730> things<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.540> are<00:02:12.660> better<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
if you'll do things that are better and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890 
if you'll do things that are better and
you<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.240> there's<00:02:15.240> ways<00:02:15.390> they'll<00:02:15.600> make<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you know there's ways they'll make more

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.350 
you know there's ways they'll make more
