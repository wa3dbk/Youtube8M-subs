00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone just now 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 put 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.559
 ios 7.0.3, etc. 3 don't give it yet 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 let's see what has changed 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.910
 but pay special attention to speed 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 work first we have changed 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.359
 shoot more accurately it accelerated 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.650
 standard animation so happens 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 sometimes 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.480
 some jerks are still but 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.630
 in my opinion it became better 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.430
 and if we go setup the main 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 Universal access 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.329
 and here there is such a point reduction 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.329
 movements now if we turn it on 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:56.850
 us animation going on like this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 correspondingly noticeably faster in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.150
 us all launching applications will be less 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.290
 lags due animation especially on 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.780
 devices are not the most powerful stuffing 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.340
 also thought a lot to like 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.060
 what they added spotlight search in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 the internet 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 now go and for some reason did not remove him 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:32.759
 earlier folder animation also happens 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 if we talk about speed but turn 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 screen a little faster became possible you do not 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
 so it will be noticeable as all the same 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 write video at 25 fps in my opinion 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 became faster but still such 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 there is no smoothness as it was on him with 6 and if 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.070
 talk about 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:57.090
 Call it is necessary tasks nasty so this 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:02.750
 happens and unfortunately nothing is better 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 It became in this plan because sometimes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 yes almost always when opening here 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.780
 through multitasking apps this 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.780
 noticeable jerks going on here 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 also among the corrections correct 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 various bugs for example with regard to 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.440
 iphone 5s and new chip which 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.510
 coprocessor m7 more often puzzles there he 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.400
 kosyachil and now sort of like you 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.350
 calibrated so it should be all 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.310
 good but general list of changes 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.360
 significant enough by the way about 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.930
 setting wallpaper really became 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.740
 quickly secondly they are still 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.390
 added visual animation when they 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:17.140
 installation, let us put the buttons 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:23.170
 now responds to pressing indication 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.580
 that she put as you can see noticeably 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.910
 noticeably faster than 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.400
 there were moments corrected some 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:36.730
 but it still feels like p3 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.970
 of course no longer pulls well we already 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.960
 presented ipad air 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.150
 new ipad mini retina there of course 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.540
 everything should be quick reviews of new and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:57.400
 pads will be on the channel 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:01.170
 they will go on sale on November 1 and more 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.170
 I did not notice any visual changes 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 chat they are on the keyboard
