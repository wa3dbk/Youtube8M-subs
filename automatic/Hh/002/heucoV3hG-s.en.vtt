can route the cables x08 a cables or ide
cables<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> still<00:01:49.200> use<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.530> um<00:01:50.240> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
cables that we still use them um and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.149 
cables that we still use them um and
then<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.880> give<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.270> little

kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.909> throw<00:01:59.909> every<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.509> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
kind of like just throw every all of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of like just throw every all of
your<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:01.200> cables<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.740> there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.010 

I<00:02:04.490> see<00:02:05.490> again<00:02:05.700> here's<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.860> some<00:02:09.020> cable

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I see again here's your some cable

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.020 
I see again here's your some cable
management<00:02:10.200> holes<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> give<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
management holes and then they give you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.570 
management holes and then they give you
these<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.920> these<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.340> use

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
these right here to these you would use

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.390 
these right here to these you would use
for<00:02:15.090> your<00:02:15.510> zip<00:02:15.840> ties<00:02:16.020> either<00:02:16.920> zip<00:02:17.310> ties<00:02:17.520> or

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
for your zip ties either zip ties or

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.030 
for your zip ties either zip ties or
twist<00:02:20.400> ties<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:22.040> basically

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
twist ties so that you can basically

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.630 
twist ties so that you can basically
keep<00:02:23.520> all<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:23.730> cables<00:02:24.300> together<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.610> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
keep all your cables together so that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390 
keep all your cables together so that
they're<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.150> hanging<00:02:28.040> hanging<00:02:29.040> around
