00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.570 

what<00:00:05.340> does<00:00:05.520> timing<00:00:05.910> mean<00:00:06.090> for<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.450> ah<00:00:07.580> that's

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
what does timing mean for you ah that's

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.600 
what does timing mean for you ah that's
a<00:00:08.700> very<00:00:08.910> difficult<00:00:09.719> question<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.709> think<00:00:11.099> there

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
a very difficult question I think there

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.670 
a very difficult question I think there
are<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.790> couple<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.240> approaches<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.469> take

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
are a couple of approaches we can take

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.920 
are a couple of approaches we can take
one<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.980> course<00:00:17.009> the<00:00:17.930> mathematical

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
one is of course the mathematical

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.790 
one is of course the mathematical
approach<00:00:19.200> that<00:00:19.980> says<00:00:20.989> like<00:00:21.989> in<00:00:22.140> real<00:00:22.320> life<00:00:22.560> if

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
approach that says like in real life if

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.659 
approach that says like in real life if
if<00:00:23.579> you<00:00:24.029> say<00:00:24.239> I'll<00:00:24.419> be<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.689> at<00:00:24.930> 2<00:00:25.079> o'clock<00:00:25.669> if

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
if you say I'll be there at 2 o'clock if

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.210 
if you say I'll be there at 2 o'clock if
you<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.419> at<00:00:27.599> five<00:00:27.869> pass<00:00:28.110> -<00:00:28.439> you're<00:00:28.710> too<00:00:29.070> late

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you are at five pass - you're too late

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.330 
you are at five pass - you're too late
and<00:00:29.669> it's<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.720> memorable<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.649> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and it's a it's just memorable and it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.760 
and it's a it's just memorable and it's
the<00:00:32.430> same<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.290> perfect<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the same with with perfect time or a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
the same with with perfect time or a
metronomic<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:36.030> things<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
metronomic time or things that the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.100 
metronomic time or things that the
computer<00:00:37.320> pro<00:00:37.860> tools<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.490> that<00:00:38.990> you<00:00:39.990> know

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
computer pro tools can do that you know

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.850 
computer pro tools can do that you know
you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:42.260> certain<00:00:43.260> time<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.710> then

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you can have a certain time and then

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
you can have a certain time and then
measure<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> against<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.630> that's<00:00:45.810> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
measure it against that so that's a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.670 
measure it against that so that's a
mathematical<00:00:46.110> approach<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:48.200> think<00:00:49.200> many

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
mathematical approach and I think many

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.300 
mathematical approach and I think many
drummers<00:00:50.690> because<00:00:51.829> don't<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.980> anything

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
drummers because don't have anything

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.610 
drummers because don't have anything
else<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:53.880> mathematical<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.079> hard<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
else it's not mathematical it's hard to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
else it's not mathematical it's hard to
find<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.250> answer<00:00:56.700> there<00:00:56.970> are<00:00:57.120> many<00:00:57.270> answers

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
find one answer there are many answers

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.229 
find one answer there are many answers
and<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> metamath<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.640> mathematical

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and that was the metamath a mathematical

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.380 
and that was the metamath a mathematical
one<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.290> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.220> one<00:01:02.670> certain<00:01:03.060> answer

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
one there is you know one certain answer

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.410 
one there is you know one certain answer
so<00:01:03.540> many<00:01:03.750> people<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.939> gravitate<00:01:05.939> towards

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so many people I think gravitate towards

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.500 
so many people I think gravitate towards
that<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> viable<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that because it's there is a viable and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.360 
that because it's there is a viable and
wrong<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.440> know<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:11.430> wrong<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> there's

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
wrong you know or wrong and but there's

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.850 
wrong you know or wrong and but there's
also<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> emotional<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.740> know

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
also the emotional and and you know

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
also the emotional and and you know
relationship<00:01:17.960> time<00:01:18.960> sense<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
relationship time sense which is you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
relationship time sense which is you
know<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.560> speech<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.100> when<00:01:23.250> someone<00:01:23.520> says<00:01:23.700> oh

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
know in speech when when someone says oh

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
know in speech when when someone says oh
man<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.140> perfect<00:01:25.770> timing<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
man that that was perfect timing it it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.399 
man that that was perfect timing it it
doesn't<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> someone<00:01:27.870> is<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> time

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
doesn't mean that someone is on time

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.890 
doesn't mean that someone is on time
necessarily<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.520> means<00:01:29.729> maybe<00:01:30.360> someone<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
necessarily it means maybe someone is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.370 
necessarily it means maybe someone is
like<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:32.100> someone<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.580> anticipating<00:01:33.479> what

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
like maybe someone is anticipating what

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.420 
like maybe someone is anticipating what
that<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> person<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.130> doing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that the person is doing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
that the person is doing
someone<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.909> sensitive<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:37.200> other

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
someone is sensitive to what other

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.760 
someone is sensitive to what other
person<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.979> needing<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.110> someone<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
person is needing so so if someone is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.149 
person is needing so so if someone is
sitting<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.220> his<00:01:41.310> office<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.000> saying

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.530 

ding-dong<00:01:47.159> someone<00:01:47.549> knocks<00:01:47.760> at<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> door

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
ding-dong someone knocks at the door

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810 
ding-dong someone knocks at the door
it<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.190> pizza<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
it was like do you want a pizza that

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
it was like do you want a pizza that
gather<00:01:51.300> bees<00:01:51.600> oh<00:01:51.780> man<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.620> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
gather bees oh man that that is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
gather bees oh man that that is
perfectly<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:53.660> time<00:01:54.660> but<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.500> nothing

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
perfectly time time but it's nothing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
perfectly time time but it's nothing
maybe<00:01:56.160> didn't<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.940> know<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.570> didn't<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.900> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
maybe didn't you know they didn't have a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.570 
maybe didn't you know they didn't have a
date<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.440> an<00:01:58.560> appointment<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.370> just

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
date or an appointment it's just

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.110 
date or an appointment it's just
something<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.500> some<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.010> magic<00:02:02.490> yes

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
something that some kind of magic yes

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.140 
something that some kind of magic yes
it's<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.080> as<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.830> two<00:02:05.070> human<00:02:05.790> beings

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
it's it's as to do with two human beings

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
of the receiver you know it's not it's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
of the receiver you know it's not it's
not<00:02:11.640> about<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> wrong<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.780> about<00:02:12.840> oh

and<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> same<00:02:15.690> advance<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.560> like

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and it's the same advance but it's like

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.600 
and it's the same advance but it's like
okay<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:18.600> know<00:02:18.720> some<00:02:19.200> some<00:02:19.800> people<00:02:19.950> might

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
okay you know some some people might

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.410 
okay you know some some people might
like<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.270> if<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.510> play<00:02:21.870> really<00:02:22.140> ahead<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
like it if you play really ahead and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.540 
like it if you play really ahead and
some<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.620> not<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.280> being

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
some because it's not so when that being

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.090 
some because it's not so when that being
said<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.880> think<00:02:30.240> there<00:02:30.390> are<00:02:30.420> certain<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.980> know

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
said I think there are certain you know

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.570 
said I think there are certain you know
with<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.760> our<00:02:32.940> expecting<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:34.470> our<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:35.550> are

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
with with our expecting with our we are

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.770 
with with our expecting with our we are
used<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.150> very<00:02:36.540> good<00:02:36.960> time<00:02:37.230> nowadays<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.100> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
used to very good time nowadays but and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.710 
used to very good time nowadays but and
in<00:02:39.780> terms<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.380> mathematical<00:02:41.190> time<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.300> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
in terms of that mathematical time so I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.320 
in terms of that mathematical time so I
think<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:43.110> are<00:02:43.620> very<00:02:43.920> close<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
think we are very close to that but it's

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860 
think we are very close to that but it's
not<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.750> simple<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.320> right<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.709> all
