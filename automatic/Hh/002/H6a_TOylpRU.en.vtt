you sick of having to come up here and
just<00:00:21.510> build<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.230> block<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.700> it<00:00:23.820> go

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
just build one block at a time and it go

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.760 
just build one block at a time and it go
really<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.449> slow<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.410> did<00:00:25.530> you<00:00:25.619> know

really really slow but did you know
there's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> speed<00:00:26.369> build<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.940> here<00:00:27.270> if<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
there's a speed build on here if you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
there's a speed build on here if you
kind<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.080> aim<00:00:28.350> toward<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> wall<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
kind of aim toward the wall like this

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.799 
kind of aim toward the wall like this
and<00:00:30.300> hold<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.879> place<00:00:33.180> block<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and hold the a and the place block and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.979 
and hold the a and the place block and
you<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.379> hold<00:00:34.530> them<00:00:34.760> like<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.870> can

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you just hold them like this as you can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.840 
you just hold them like this as you can
see<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> super<00:00:38.010> super<00:00:38.219> fast<00:00:38.460> build

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
see you can do a super super fast build

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.579 
see you can do a super super fast build
now<00:00:39.479> I<00:00:39.539> know<00:00:39.659> some<00:00:39.929> of<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.079> guys<00:00:40.170> already<00:00:40.409> know

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
now I know some of you guys already know

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.139 
now I know some of you guys already know
about<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.309> some<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.699> guys<00:00:41.789> might<00:00:42.030> be

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
about this but some of you guys might be

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.309 
about this but some of you guys might be
building<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> old-school<00:00:42.749> way<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.229> it's

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.319 
building the old-school way and it's

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.349 
building the old-school way and it's
very<00:00:43.559> slow<00:00:43.949> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.519> also<00:00:44.639> do<00:00:44.819> it<00:00:44.969> going

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
very slow you can also do it going

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.540 
very slow you can also do it going
upwards<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:46.199> you<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.589> see<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.100> he<00:00:47.159> just<00:00:47.249> did

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
upwards as you see see how he just did

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 
upwards as you see see how he just did
it<00:00:47.659> it's<00:00:48.659> a<00:00:48.749> really<00:00:49.079> fast<00:00:49.409> way<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.069> building

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it it's a really fast way of building

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.789 
it it's a really fast way of building
and<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.809> mean<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.049> can<00:00:52.199> pretty<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.769> it

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
and it I mean you can pretty much do it

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.169 
and it I mean you can pretty much do it
at<00:00:52.949> any<00:00:53.100> angle<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:53.999> in<00:00:54.089> an

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
at any angle you have to do it in an

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.270 
at any angle you have to do it in an
angle<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.780> can't<00:00:55.049> mess<00:00:55.229> up<00:00:55.409> but<00:00:55.710> as

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
angle because you can't mess up but as

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
angle because you can't mess up but as
you<00:00:56.459> see<00:00:56.609> here<00:00:56.639> you<00:00:57.359> can<00:00:57.569> get<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.749> lot<00:00:58.109> more

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you see here you can get a lot more

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.090 
you see here you can get a lot more
stuff<00:00:58.709> build<00:00:59.069> at<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.429> very<00:00:59.819> very<00:01:00.659> quick<00:01:01.199> time

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
stuff build at a very very quick time

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
stuff build at a very very quick time
you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.519> also<00:01:02.639> do<00:01:02.819> this<00:01:02.940> share<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.420> with

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can also do this share here with

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
you can also do this share here with
your<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.440> wrong<00:01:04.619> area<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.580> start

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
your get in the wrong area you start

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160 
your get in the wrong area you start
messing<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> doing<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.020> right

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
messing up and doing that right

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
messing up and doing that right
there<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> fix<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
there and you have to fix it I think you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
there and you have to fix it I think you
did<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> too<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.050> have<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> fix

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
did it too and you have to kind of fix

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
did it too and you have to kind of fix
it<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.550> put<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.760> together<00:01:11.910> but<00:01:12.690> once<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> get

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it and put it together but once you get

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.290 
it and put it together but once you get
the<00:01:13.440> hang<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.370> speed<00:01:14.850> build<00:01:15.090> thing

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
the hang of this like speed build thing

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.570 
the hang of this like speed build thing
you'll<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.140> building<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.650> lot<00:01:16.680> quicker<00:01:17.280> maybe

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you'll be building a lot quicker maybe

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.690 
you'll be building a lot quicker maybe
just<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.910> in<00:01:18.000> front<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.700> boom

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
just go in front of it there we go boom

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
just go in front of it there we go boom
that<00:01:21.390> wall<00:01:21.600> done<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.140> give<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> another

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that wall done just give it another

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.630 
that wall done just give it another
example<00:01:26.630> John<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:29.370> like<00:01:29.460> some

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
example John and like this is like some

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
about that super fast build mode stuff

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
about that super fast build mode stuff
like<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.760> yet<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.720> recommend<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.440> guys

try it like I said you pretty much just
hold<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.840> fly<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.470> hold<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.980> place<00:01:44.280> down

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
hold the fly and you hold the place down

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.700 
hold the fly and you hold the place down
the<00:01:44.610> block<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.150> can<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:46.290> huge

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the block so you can just make huge

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
the block so you can just make huge
structures<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.550> just<00:01:47.580> before<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.540> just

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
structures and just before I go I just

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
structures and just before I go I just
want<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> give<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> guys<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.800> more<00:01:49.830> like<00:01:50.190> mini
