them up to radiate when he wants to
basically<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:13.730> three<00:02:14.730> lurkers<00:02:15.090> really

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
basically at will three lurkers really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.809 
basically at will three lurkers really
is<00:02:15.750> six<00:02:16.530> workers<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.040> handful<00:02:17.370> muta<00:02:17.640> list

is six workers and a handful muta list

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.940 
is six workers and a handful muta list
isn't<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.480> enough<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:19.590> effectively

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
isn't going to be enough to effectively

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.530 
isn't going to be enough to effectively
repeal<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.489> tack<00:02:20.760> again<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.299> looks<00:02:21.420> like

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
repeal this tack again but it looks like

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
repeal this tack again but it looks like
yeah<00:02:21.720> he's<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.140> he's<00:02:22.379> kind<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.970> hurting

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
yeah he's kind of he's kind of hurting

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.210 
yeah he's kind of he's kind of hurting
them<00:02:24.120> again<00:02:24.420> he<00:02:24.930> might<00:02:25.079> be<00:02:25.230> trying<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:26.069> in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
them again he might be trying to get in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.429 
them again he might be trying to get in
a<00:02:26.280> backside<00:02:26.640> attack<00:02:26.900> against<00:02:27.900> these<00:02:28.079> Marines

a backside attack against these Marines
these<00:02:29.430> two<00:02:29.670> lurkers<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.390> get

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
these two lurkers are going to get

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.360 
these two lurkers are going to get
irradiated<00:02:30.739> even<00:02:31.739> if<00:02:31.799> they're<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
irradiated even if they're not that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.849 
irradiated even if they're not that
those<00:02:32.849> two<00:02:33.060> tanks<00:02:33.420> are<00:02:33.540> both<00:02:34.260> range<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
those two tanks are both range and

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.140 
those two tanks are both range and
probably<00:02:35.129> going<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> be<00:02:35.400> able<00:02:35.579> to<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.790> siege

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
probably going to be able to get siege

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.800 
probably going to be able to get siege
in<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> second<00:02:37.049> here<00:02:37.200> oh<00:02:38.390> good<00:02:39.390> job<00:02:39.599> on

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
in just a second here oh good job on

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.559 
in just a second here oh good job on
pulling<00:02:40.109> those<00:02:40.349> scourges<00:02:41.159> back<00:02:41.489> by<00:02:42.030> GG<00:02:42.359> play

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.750 
pulling those scourges back by GG play
he<00:02:43.409> would<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.560> lost<00:02:43.709> those<00:02:44.040> loss<00:02:44.549> of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
he would have lost those loss of

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.599 
he would have lost those loss of
scooters<00:02:45.090> he's<00:02:45.269> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.980> using<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.069> kind<00:02:47.519> of

scooters he's kind of using them kind of

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.110 
scooters he's kind of using them kind of
to<00:02:47.879> bait<00:02:48.480> those<00:02:48.690> forces<00:02:49.019> back<00:02:49.909> he's<00:02:50.909> going<00:02:51.060> to

to bait those forces back he's going to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.119 
to bait those forces back he's going to
lose<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.480> expansion<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.950> meantime

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
lose this expansion in the meantime

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.770 
lose this expansion in the meantime
looks<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.609> he's<00:02:53.790> Fleming<00:02:54.299> his<00:02:54.389> forces<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
looks like he's Fleming his forces a
