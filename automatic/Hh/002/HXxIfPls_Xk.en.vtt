ride<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:43.940> noticed<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.480> Iron<00:00:45.899> Horse<00:00:46.350> Texas

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
ride I noticed on my Iron Horse Texas

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.760 
ride I noticed on my Iron Horse Texas
chopper<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> bottoms<00:00:48.660> occasionally<00:00:49.590> on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
chopper that it bottoms occasionally on

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.670 
chopper that it bottoms occasionally on
what<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> thought<00:00:50.579> were<00:00:50.879> relatively<00:00:51.449> small

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
what I thought were relatively small

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
what I thought were relatively small
bumps<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.760> thought<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.420> needed<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
bumps and I thought it just needed a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
bumps and I thought it just needed a
shock<00:00:55.230> adjustment<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.640> may<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
shock adjustment and they may not have

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.650 
shock adjustment and they may not have
they<00:00:57.690> may<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.609> soft<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
they may have been set to soft so I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
they may have been set to soft so I
brought<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.530> local<00:01:01.770> mechanic<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
brought it into my local mechanic and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
brought it into my local mechanic and
naturally<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:05.129> wasn't

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
naturally as those things go that wasn't

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.960 
naturally as those things go that wasn't
really<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.240> problem<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> let's<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> look

started<00:02:05.250> let's<00:02:06.030> write<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:06.720> one<00:02:06.929> -

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
started let's write the right one -

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
started let's write the right one -
though<00:02:07.409> none<00:02:07.679> of<00:02:07.710> these<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:08.160> jammed<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
though none of these are jammed to the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.539 
though none of these are jammed to the
right<00:02:09.360> positions<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.310> could

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
right positions so you think that could

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.850 
right positions so you think that could
be<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.790> problem<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.780> dangerous

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
be my problem this is dangerous
