00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 we are with the one who has just proclaimed 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.240
 champion of madrid duathlon and has won 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.970
 the career of alcobendas 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.890
 what did you think of this 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.120
 this year your account that was killing 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.310
 everything practically good is pretty 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.710
 surprised because first I found 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.710
 with that of rivas that I found because 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.530
 but I can take it hold the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.270
 attacks of iván rosé and in the end very 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.250
 fine and then 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.630
 the next was the cottage that the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.800
 day was before so that my 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.920
 characteristics 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.790
 who has no skill on the bike and was 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.900
 very hard and one day and also daily 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.400
 next I had commitment to my club 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.390
 valdeiglesia martín berlanas de correr 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.340
 the short cross we do not know what 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.489
 built historic cargo for a 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.260
 small of four friends and good after 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.489
 of that then I had what it restored and not 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.059
 I would say a forecast goring 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.420
 booked and been this week pretty 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.100
 on standby and today I tried to run 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.900
 very strong at the beginning what will leave me 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.210
 the twin and the best of what I thought 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.250
 It took a lot of work but then 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
 to set up a way for me 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 confused because there was a band of him 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.090
 I was there doing like this 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 and not 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.450
 and behind canaries but well I can not 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:46.230
 endure and last race is very hard 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:49.610
 because it has gone very badly of veteranía 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.610
 that is why I well known 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 in spite of it when it finished what 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.370
 which is his and effectively but I 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.100
 I thought that you have to give about 300 meters 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.810
 for goal and there were 700 left 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.520
 that loosen up a bit that there was no 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.250
 I arrived saving a bit because there was 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 sprint but good in the end it has grown 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 logically because he has not seen a shot he 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 He has thrown for me but I already had not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.470
 I will not go over and above saying a march 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.390
 but half march left me enough to hit 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.050
 a small change and win and very good 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 happy because because good is one like 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.820
 well you know this discipline I love and 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.860
 well now super retired and all that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.440
 follow me he still likes to go running 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 and I adapt more or less well to the bike 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 besides I am the kilo less than a game 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.660
 more when you put too much stress on people 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.660
 of the next phase 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.080
 in the ninth step and the ball has 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.190
 come to cover up to a minute makes me 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.370
 very excited to be welcome to others 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 tasks 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.120
 favorite of spain 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 good if you do not leave it in a bad place 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.810
 I'm sorry but you do not have the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.120
 exclusive I will not be able to go because it's a 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.880
 commitment to some friends of the average 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.440
 pollensa marathon on the same day and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.170
 I was committed a long time ago and good 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.940
 I feel very sorry because in addition 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.770
 options at least of could or good 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.900
 I do not know people walk a lot but I think 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.340
 that in a sprint ball 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.320
 emily it is clear that it is above is 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.150
 one has a march more than all this 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.360
 tradition and a march more than all or 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.130
 march and a half and apart from being the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.900
 version to the broker has been spent 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.420
 impressively and there are your 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.660
 medals in the World Cups practically 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.660
 nothing 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.590
 and always more 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.900
 together and retired and the 69 but hey 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 this months and now probably go 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 with my guy to the national time trial 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.780
 which I think is a fun test and 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.550
 always fun and worth living 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.550
 and I'm already with these things alive 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.120
 the second classified and the third were 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.390
 favorites have shown you how it has 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.340
 seemed like the race because quite the 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.020
 first 5,000 the truth that 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.389
 and a lot of quality has shown that 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.340
 celestial there is a single section but parts 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.320
 to follow me start uphill 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.580
 I find it hard to really start 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.960
 I've suffered 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.360
 I have suffered to endure the group but 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.490
 arriving had to arrive we have 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.130
 half understood on the vine and neither 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.860
 we were very much in agreement 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.630
 we knew what we all played and from 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.460
 back at the end we expand a bit but 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.380
 kept there to lower us forward 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.790
 and nothing the last race foot against 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.740
 very comfortable and hot bike 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.490
 starting downhill that as I go 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.880
 all right 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:02.930
 and no transition as always 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:06.830
 people and classes far we have gone 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.960
 trimming little by little kept the letter 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.280
 I did not believe it number believed 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.560
 endured we have considered me 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.450
 changed 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.580
 then he believed that the arrival was 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:21.360
 before it has burst changed me but nothing 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.360
 more has deserved to win and win 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.510
 and it has been good 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:34.110
 one more point and I think that 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.450
 I believe and I hope to have a point a little point 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.150
 more study from last year 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.890
 let's go with Ivan, you've made a 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.100
 scary exit let's avoid half 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.100
 career 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.070
 but good controlling favorites 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.450
 country 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:20.560
 found the thing we basically 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.630
 we have run 5000 sacredly fast and 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.710
 well it was not what we planned we 're going to 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.050
 accept what the myths of new 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.400
 bicycle books of the first two 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.820
 we understand each other quite well 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.790
 we have all gone more or less 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.100
 relay qualities and the third drop 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.410
 he has already begun to see something with the lack 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.910
 of training some attack but good 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.190
 they cut it a little bit behind 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.350
 we realized and we go again to 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.090
 throwing a little bit did not throw at all the 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.040
 world and in the end but we kept the 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.290
 distance and we already knew that the last 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.390
 race was going to be the law of the strongest 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.670
 player that also transitions and 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.900
 that 500 thousand 500 that with a good 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.360
 force transition that now better 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.040
 about 8 or 10 12 seconds because you can 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.530
 serve to make a third position that 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.150
 without a cause time because there would be 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.760
 today as Alberto and better I saw myself sitting 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.260
 the possible what I tried I've seen first 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:18.100
 I say I'm going to throw everything I can but 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:20.350
 I knew that also with other complete I 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.910
 I put behind them and hold them 50 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.100
 few meters and 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.750
 and then hold the third position and 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.710
 very happy because it has been a race 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.710
 very hard 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.730
 It's been a long time since he has run a ball 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:40.950
 regional level so before everything was 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:40.950
 more own of the two 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.330
 you will have to see it thanks
