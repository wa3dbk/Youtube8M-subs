how<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.870> build<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.470> specific<00:00:07.710> structure<00:00:08.570> so

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
how to build a specific structure so

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.749 
how to build a specific structure so
many<00:00:09.990> people<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.469> asked<00:00:10.950> me<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.309> tell<00:00:11.519> them

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
many people have asked me to tell them

many people have asked me to tell them
the<00:00:12.000> kind<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.509> secret<00:00:13.049> behind<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.530> buildings

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
the kind of secret behind my buildings

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
the kind of secret behind my buildings
and<00:00:14.190> their<00:00:14.340> style<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:14.969> there<00:00:15.870> isn't<00:00:16.020> really<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
and their style but there isn't really a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
and their style but there isn't really a
secret<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.369> I'll<00:00:17.490> show<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.420> video

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
secret but I'll show you in this video

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
secret but I'll show you in this video
what<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:19.859> makes<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> difference

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
what I think makes all the difference

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.650 
what I think makes all the difference
between<00:00:21.180> my<00:00:21.689> house<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.740> buildings<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> just

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
between my house my buildings and just

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.310 
between my house my buildings and just
any<00:00:24.869> random<00:00:25.140> cottage<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.660> most<00:00:27.869> important

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
any random cottage so the most important

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320 
any random cottage so the most important
thing<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.650> me<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.340> find<00:00:29.789> an<00:00:29.939> actual

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
thing for me was to find an actual

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200 
thing for me was to find an actual
architectural<00:00:31.230> style<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.610> stick<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
architectural style and to just stick to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.959 
architectural style and to just stick to
it<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.570> use<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> same<00:00:34.620> style<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.100> all<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.820> my

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it I use the same style for all of my

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
it I use the same style for all of my
structures<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:36.840> using<00:00:37.399> different

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
structures but I'm using different

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.600 
structures but I'm using different
materials<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> slightly<00:00:39.600> different<00:00:39.870> shapes

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
materials and slightly different shapes

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
materials and slightly different shapes
and<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.850> way<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> buildings<00:00:43.140> look

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and this way I make the buildings look

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.799 
and this way I make the buildings look
similar<00:00:43.890> yet<00:00:44.309> different<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.390> another

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
similar yet different to one another

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.660 
similar yet different to one another
yeah<00:00:47.809> I've<00:00:48.020> made<00:00:48.410> up<00:00:48.590> certain<00:00:49.160> rules<00:00:49.520> for

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
yeah I've made up certain rules for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.360 
yeah I've made up certain rules for
myself<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.660> always<00:00:50.870> stick<00:00:51.290> to<00:00:51.530> them<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
myself and I always stick to them the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.939 
myself and I always stick to them the
first<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:52.820> most<00:00:52.910> important<00:00:53.449> rule<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.770> if

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
first and most important rule is that if

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.910 
first and most important rule is that if
there<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.520> big<00:00:55.940> surface<00:00:56.239> like<00:00:56.690> wall<00:00:57.050> you

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
there is a big surface like wall you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.200 
there is a big surface like wall you
will<00:00:58.129> need<00:00:58.399> to<00:00:58.610> add<00:00:58.790> either<00:00:59.590> decoration<00:01:00.590> or

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
will need to add either decoration or

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.259 
will need to add either decoration or
structure<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:03.470> yeah<00:01:04.460> I'll<00:01:04.879> show<00:01:05.210> you

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
structure to it so yeah I'll show you

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.180 
structure to it so yeah I'll show you
this<00:01:05.509> in<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.990> few<00:01:06.259> seconds<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.890> second

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
this in a few seconds and the second

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.310 
this in a few seconds and the second
rule<00:01:07.369> is<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.820> avoid<00:01:08.150> using<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.869> simple

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
rule is to avoid using a simple

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.249 
rule is to avoid using a simple
rectangle<00:01:10.009> as<00:01:10.159> as<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.729> layout<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.930> thing<00:01:12.110> I'm

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
rectangle as as a layout the thing I'm

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.680 
rectangle as as a layout the thing I'm
doing<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.920> solve<00:01:13.399> this<00:01:13.550> problem<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.270> just

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
doing to solve this problem is to just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.950 
doing to solve this problem is to just
remove<00:01:15.080> one<00:01:15.649> block<00:01:15.920> from<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.220> edge<00:01:16.520> or<00:01:16.960> simply

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
remove one block from the edge or simply

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.580 
remove one block from the edge or simply
add<00:01:18.170> one<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:19.970> example<00:01:20.149> I'm<00:01:20.810> adding

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
add one so in this example I'm adding

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.749 
add one so in this example I'm adding
one<00:01:21.820> obviously<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.860> just<00:01:24.860> let's<00:01:25.130> put<00:01:25.729> up

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
one obviously and just let's put up

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.870 
one obviously and just let's put up
another<00:01:26.660> row<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.229> stairs<00:01:27.679> here

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
another row of stairs here

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.730 
another row of stairs here
and<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.570> thing<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.840> want<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.320> after<00:01:30.530> that

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
and the thing you want to do after that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.230 
and the thing you want to do after that
is<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.490> add<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
is to add the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.460 
is to add the
yeah<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.320> decoration<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.820> wall<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
yeah the the decoration to the wall this

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.789 
yeah the the decoration to the wall this
will<00:01:38.710> be<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> frames<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.500> adding<00:01:41.500> frames

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
will be the frames and adding frames

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.880 
will be the frames and adding frames
isn't<00:01:42.100> really<00:01:42.460> hard<00:01:42.759> but<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.450> makes<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.710> house

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
isn't really hard but it makes the house

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.320 
isn't really hard but it makes the house
look<00:01:44.920> much<00:01:45.909> much<00:01:46.180> prettier

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.990 

so<00:01:50.930> we'll<00:01:51.080> just<00:01:51.260> take<00:01:51.530> some<00:01:51.590> wood

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590 

the<00:01:55.060> upper<00:01:55.330> row<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.840> replace<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:58.270> create<00:01:58.570> a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the upper row and replace it to create a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
the upper row and replace it to create a
frame

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
frame

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.679 
frame
and<00:01:59.969> we'll<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> same<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.479> rest

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and we'll do the same thing on the rest

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.819 
and we'll do the same thing on the rest
of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.259> walls<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:06.030> we'll<00:02:06.240> add<00:02:06.479> some

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
of the walls and then we'll add some

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.499 
of the walls and then we'll add some
yeah<00:02:07.829> some<00:02:07.860> more

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
yeah some more

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:23.000 
yeah some more
I'm<00:02:10.549> sorry<00:02:11.549> some<00:02:12.360> more<00:02:13.159> frames

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.030 

yeah<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.920> really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
yeah just like this and it's really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.210 
yeah just like this and it's really
really<00:02:26.310> simple<00:02:26.970> but<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.750> makes<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
really simple but it makes the the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:44.089 
really simple but it makes the the
cottage<00:02:29.519> looks<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.299> much<00:02:30.540> better

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.509 

okay<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.000> like<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.870> we'll<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
okay just like that and we'll do the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.699 
okay just like that and we'll do the
same<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.299> other<00:02:48.569> sides<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.530> house

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
same with the other sides of the house

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.670 
same with the other sides of the house
as<00:02:50.010> well

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
as well

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.010 
as well
and<00:02:51.769> then<00:02:52.280> we've<00:02:53.150> got<00:02:53.359> us<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.109> nice<00:02:54.319> home

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
and then we've got us the nice home

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.580 
and then we've got us the nice home
just<00:02:56.740> like<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.360> looking<00:02:58.360> much<00:02:58.690> better<00:02:58.960> than

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
just like this looking much better than

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.750 
just like this looking much better than
it<00:02:59.800> did<00:02:59.920> before

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
it did before

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.930 
it did before
so<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.690> other<00:03:02.930> thing<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.190> said<00:03:04.489> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
so the other thing is as I said to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.720 
so the other thing is as I said to
remove<00:03:05.330> one<00:03:05.690> block<00:03:06.080> from<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.500> edges<00:03:06.860> we've

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
remove one block from the edges we've

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.510 
remove one block from the edges we've
got<00:03:07.970> some<00:03:08.269> ugly-looking<00:03:08.720> house<00:03:09.290> here

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
got some ugly-looking house here

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.280 
got some ugly-looking house here
and<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:11.630> will<00:03:11.810> try<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.320> fix<00:03:12.710> that

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
and we will try to fix that

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.130 
and we will try to fix that
and<00:03:14.500> we'll<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.099> remove<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.879> block<00:03:16.450> from<00:03:16.810> here

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
and we'll just remove a block from here

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.819 
and we'll just remove a block from here
and<00:03:17.939> of<00:03:18.939> course<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.599> still<00:03:20.079> looks<00:03:20.379> like

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
and of course it still looks like

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.720 
and of course it still looks like
but<00:03:21.790> we'll<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:22.799> replace<00:03:24.060> those<00:03:25.060> blocks<00:03:25.569> with

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
but we'll just replace those blocks with

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.080 
but we'll just replace those blocks with
with<00:03:27.730> wood<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.780> we'll<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.379> add<00:03:29.790> once<00:03:30.790> again

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
with wood so we'll just add once again

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.830 
with wood so we'll just add once again
frames<00:03:31.629> to<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.440> wall<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.329> we'll<00:03:34.329> do<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> same

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
frames to the wall and we'll do the same

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.440 
frames to the wall and we'll do the same
thing<00:03:35.200> as<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.620> did<00:03:35.650> with<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.370> first<00:03:36.970> cottage

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
thing as we did with the first cottage

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.270 
thing as we did with the first cottage
and<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.390> end<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:41.349> will<00:03:41.530> hopefully<00:03:41.739> look

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
and in the end it will hopefully look

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.980 
and in the end it will hopefully look
something<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.269> this

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.950 

is<00:03:46.260> not<00:03:46.710> beautiful<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.450> much

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
is not beautiful but it is it is much

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.220 
is not beautiful but it is it is much
prettier<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.770> was<00:03:49.950> before

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.220 

so<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.710> next<00:03:57.100> thing<00:03:57.400> I'm<00:03:57.550> showing<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.390> how

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
so the next thing I'm showing you is how

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.060 
so the next thing I'm showing you is how
to<00:03:59.260> add<00:03:59.440> some<00:03:59.710> structure<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:01.830> building<00:04:02.830> in

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
to add some structure to a building in

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.570 
to add some structure to a building in
this<00:04:03.610> case<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.270> will<00:04:04.390> use<00:04:04.960> the<00:04:05.500> example<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.160> a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
this case I will use the example of a

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.660 
this case I will use the example of a
wall<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.840> we'll<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.410> add<00:04:08.620> some<00:04:08.980> pillars<00:04:09.310> here

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
wall so we'll just add some pillars here

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.760 
wall so we'll just add some pillars here
the<00:04:09.850> wall<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.300> really<00:04:10.840> ugly

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
the wall is really ugly

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.120 
the wall is really ugly
just<00:04:12.340> yeah<00:04:13.330> plain<00:04:14.610> field

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
just yeah plain field

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.410 
just yeah plain field
and<00:04:17.930> now<00:04:18.930> we'll<00:04:19.140> just<00:04:19.170> add<00:04:19.850> some<00:04:20.850> more<00:04:21.090> blocks

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
and now we'll just add some more blocks

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.130 
and now we'll just add some more blocks
to<00:04:21.810> make<00:04:22.560> those<00:04:23.340> like<00:04:23.640> stabilizing<00:04:24.570> pull<00:04:25.020> us

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
to make those like stabilizing pull us

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.970 
to make those like stabilizing pull us
at<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.620> wall

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.190 

and<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.910> next<00:04:31.330> step<00:04:31.630> we<00:04:32.110> will<00:04:32.290> just<00:04:32.670> take

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
and in a next step we will just take

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.040 
and in a next step we will just take
stone<00:04:35.200> slaps<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.860> place<00:04:36.370> them<00:04:36.610> on<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.760> ground

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.230 

and<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.289> will<00:04:40.470> make<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:41.159> whole<00:04:41.190> wall<00:04:41.669> look

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and it will make the whole wall look

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.970 
and it will make the whole wall look
much<00:04:42.960> less<00:04:43.379> static<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.669> much<00:04:45.180> more<00:04:45.479> plastic

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
much less static and much more plastic

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.180 
much less static and much more plastic
and<00:04:48.070> by<00:04:48.760> adding<00:04:49.410> torches<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:50.440> can<00:04:50.830> always

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
and by adding torches you can always

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.190 
and by adding torches you can always
create<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:52.380> surface<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:54.600> indy<00:04:55.600> in<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.020> night

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
create a surface for indy in the night

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.650 
create a surface for indy in the night
and<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:57.010> dawn<00:04:58.230> like<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.590> nice<00:05:00.520> surface<00:05:01.180> with

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
and the dawn like a nice surface with

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.610 
and the dawn like a nice surface with
shadows<00:05:02.290> all<00:05:02.530> over<00:05:03.210> okay<00:05:04.210> another<00:05:04.840> thing<00:05:04.960> is

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
shadows all over okay another thing is

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.120 
shadows all over okay another thing is
to<00:05:06.100> build<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.150> buildings<00:05:07.630> actual<00:05:08.080> into<00:05:08.740> a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
to build the buildings actual into a

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.810 
to build the buildings actual into a
mountain<00:05:10.120> or<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.330> hoe<00:05:10.870> or<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.800> build<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.340> houses

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
mountain or a hoe or to build the houses

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.020 
mountain or a hoe or to build the houses
and<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> hillside<00:05:13.690> or<00:05:14.020> on<00:05:14.350> top<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.800> hill

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
and a hillside or on top of a hill

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.500 
and a hillside or on top of a hill
anything<00:05:16.030> just<00:05:16.330> play<00:05:16.930> with<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.510> landscape

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
anything just play with the landscape

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.480 
anything just play with the landscape
and<00:05:19.750> not<00:05:19.870> against<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.650> know<00:05:20.980> I'm<00:05:21.250> sounding

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
and not against it I know I'm sounding

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.790 
and not against it I know I'm sounding
like<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.480> Greenpeace<00:05:23.020> activists<00:05:23.590> right

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
like I can Greenpeace activists right

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.090 
like I can Greenpeace activists right
now<00:05:23.980> but<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.960> think<00:05:25.960> it's<00:05:26.140> really<00:05:26.470> important<00:05:26.920> to

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
now but I think it's really important to

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.940 
now but I think it's really important to
use<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.940> kind<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.450> building<00:05:29.260> style

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
use this kind of building style

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.980 
use this kind of building style
and<00:05:31.040> what<00:05:31.670> you<00:05:31.760> can<00:05:31.910> see<00:05:32.270> in<00:05:32.420> this<00:05:32.540> picture<00:05:32.750> is

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and what you can see in this picture is

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.510 
and what you can see in this picture is
that<00:05:33.170> you<00:05:33.590> have<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:34.430> simply

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
that you have to simply

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.310 
that you have to simply
variety<00:05:37.520> materials<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.210> are<00:05:38.330> using<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:39.290> you

variety materials you are using so you

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.150 
variety materials you are using so you
see<00:05:39.710> here<00:05:40.040> I<00:05:40.250> used<00:05:41.210> stone<00:05:42.140> bricks<00:05:42.500> in<00:05:43.010> a

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
see here I used stone bricks in a

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.190 
see here I used stone bricks in a
combination<00:05:43.700> with<00:05:43.880> white<00:05:44.210> wool<00:05:44.480> I<00:05:44.810> use

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
combination with white wool I use

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.100 
combination with white wool I use
cobblestone<00:05:45.530> with<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.550> light<00:05:47.360> gray<00:05:47.660> wool

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
cobblestone with a light gray wool

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.890 
cobblestone with a light gray wool
I<00:05:48.140> used<00:05:48.890> houses<00:05:49.360> with<00:05:50.360> yeah<00:05:51.460> redwood<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.900> so

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
I used houses with yeah redwood and so

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.290 
I used houses with yeah redwood and so
all<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.470> houses<00:05:54.680> look<00:05:55.100> different<00:05:55.670> but<00:05:56.090> they

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
all the houses look different but they

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.030 
all the houses look different but they
are<00:05:56.330> all<00:05:56.420> built<00:05:56.780> in<00:05:56.960> a<00:05:57.050> similar<00:05:57.410> style<00:05:57.680> and

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
are all built in a similar style and

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.660 
are all built in a similar style and
this<00:05:58.490> way<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:59.240> creates<00:05:59.450> a<00:05:59.900> a<00:06:00.200> natural<00:06:00.620> kind<00:06:01.580> of

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
this way it creates a a natural kind of

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.830 
this way it creates a a natural kind of
look<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.770> another<00:06:03.770> thing<00:06:04.070> is<00:06:04.400> that<00:06:05.000> I'm<00:06:05.570> using

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
look and another thing is that I'm using

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.690 
look and another thing is that I'm using
different<00:06:06.560> kinds<00:06:06.950> of<00:06:07.180> roof<00:06:09.280> designs<00:06:10.280> that's

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
different kinds of roof designs that's

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.390 
different kinds of roof designs that's
with<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.060> word<00:06:11.620> as<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.740> can<00:06:12.890> see<00:06:13.100> in<00:06:13.280> this

it's just simple variation of the
materials<00:06:24.920> you<00:06:25.130> are<00:06:25.160> using<00:06:26.740> so<00:06:27.740> I<00:06:28.100> hope<00:06:28.490> this

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
materials you are using so I hope this

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.610 
materials you are using so I hope this
tutorial<00:06:28.910> was<00:06:29.840> helpful<00:06:30.010> if<00:06:31.010> it<00:06:31.910> wasn't<00:06:32.620> just

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
tutorial was helpful if it wasn't just
