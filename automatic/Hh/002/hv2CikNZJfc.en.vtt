 wanted to make you a little video a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.539
 little comments happen if I did 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.579
 a monday i 'm nice i 'm still going 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.129
 to make a brace to mark the coup 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.539
 of the 3000 what and you are talking some 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.309
 things so before anything else I'm going 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 talk to you I introduced you to the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 first gameplay so basically we're in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 europe and he claims with at 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 some members of the case hyena and two 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.640
 subscribers so there is a sergei smurf is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.020
 seen state and two subscribers so you 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.460
 know i think sergey smar son 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.619
 instep is a new member of the ncaa 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.080
 he just joined us it's a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.369
 american by the way and the two subscribers 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 was alex blast alex and dmk silva rhÃ´ne 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.479
 seems the same even if the bar is a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 actor he is part of a team of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.740
 knife too so 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.860
 so here I was with them and basically 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 here it is noted that he only at my 20th and not 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 you make a group of six convoys and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 even we try to get to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.340
 74 that's the same 1775 they're trying 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.200
 to get to 74 the fastest 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.020
 possible and with the most before if 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 possible on the friends what really 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.330
 what is most important is 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.510
 take the most advanced possible so 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.510
 to die the least to fill needs 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.800
 time to try stuff and that's it 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.420
 afterwards we try to have a 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.150
 beautiful killcam with tomahawk tracking 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.530
 end of the knife launched pardon with the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.880
 followed by sarre always have beautiful 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.290
 small benches shot room still makes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 what 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.700
 so here is yes also on the gameplay it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.280
 there will surely be no sound because this 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 that sergei 1 know and sergei he 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 said that shit all the time good 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.490
 here I recorded the voices so we 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 hear others speak that slips my 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.940
 girl be everyone and sergey says 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.880
 more shit than the others anyway 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.770
 thrown to say to each other here so there will be no 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 sounds but I still wanted you 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700
 present it because the game is nice 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.750
 play sniper hollinger not knife 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.400
 it's true that sometimes you play alarm 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 often for op click and shall 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 weapons from elsewhere sometimes hot knife 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 but my relationship regain a maximum 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.380
 from before this game plays alarm and it's true 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.260
 that I do some 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.910
 some nice kills with a knife 11 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.070
 gameplay I believe that both banks 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.960
 are there anymore he's claiming so here I am 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.510
 did you still want to propose and 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.620
 I'm not disgusting leiber game I 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.560
 think if I could have been an iphone 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.670
 I would have become a sniper 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.980
 I do not think I'm a leftist 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.380
 whew but what's up what's that for the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 gameplay it's done so I wanted to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.090
 thank you for three quarters 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.530
 Once again thank you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.970
 I wanted to do something special a 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.620
 little bit because da last 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.390
 obviously to mark the coup what good 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.239
 the troika is a landing is not no 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.720
 plus a cable caddy my scale is 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.209
 cool and I actually wanted to know what 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.560
 you wanted yourself so it's up to you to 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.940
 tell me what you want to 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 see for the three four months I put 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.810
 you give a little ideas that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.010
 I had but if you can interact 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.930
 in the comments and tell me 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 really what you want - me that 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.510
 would not help me I can offer you to at 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.340
 almost everything but I finally here 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 frankly tell me guys me I'm going 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.209
 make you happy so here it is at 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.500
 you tell me what you want - the 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.739
 ideas that I basically have g in this 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.810
 same evening we have very rope 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.060
 Fifth line that encamps and that 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.970
 camp actually had 'record' 4 or 5 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.310
 williams to voices there are the see all the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.290
 world and here we have cam kits to 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.299
 every time so I think and you in 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.379
 posted by year 3 I did not say why not 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.390
 half an hour to be pretty much a 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.190
 half an hour 10 minutes each game is going 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.750
 say about 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.030
 and here I can post it 3 you 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.690
 do a little half an hour of kiel 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.100
 cam a feint of forgetfulness doped killcam 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.209
 still she feeds trio ray 3 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.639
 calm kills on 3 game 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.870
 this is me the idea that I had if that 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.639
 please tell me what you like 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.979
 not tell me also if you have 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.060
 other ideas tell me so is the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.099
 second idea I had is that 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.440
 before i was a player on pc 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.729
 counter strike source so maybe 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.849
 that some of you know 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.460
 others no this is a healthy man 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.979
 fps surely dad fps fps 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.750
 first ps1 counter strike on pc and 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.660
 here I was a level not deueueu 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.660
 branches or alarm at that time the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.039
 page and knife on counter strike and 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.420
 the jar on a not-so-messy level and that's 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.670
 true that I had made a fragmovie so 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.200
 a montage a guy who had told me a 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.910
 editing so it was rather for a 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.320
 ultimate account is so editing is 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.710
 rather cool it lasts not very long 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 ceni is 40 and his pages the pc I am 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.560
 I'm always told that I wanted to 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.810
 put it on my chain Hema why not 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.190
 for three-quarters age said is 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.160
 pretty cool and if you want to see other 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.830
 something less about another video game 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.700
 formula said the mrap so so 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.980
 I would really like you 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.930
 post it's not huge to these two 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.410
 minutes against as I tell you so 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.669
 a small pitch quite a lot in the mouth 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.750
 perfect and and that's so I believe that 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.259
 that's all I had to tell you 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.970
 for the three cases ah yes and also I 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.250
 will tell you about my second 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.539
 editing so it's not just fast 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.639
 will work on it because it is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.440
 completely overwhelmed by work and 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.060
 he does not have time to do it what he 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.800
 there really is no time so 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.669
 finally it's stiff but who goes there 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.380
 so stick a publisher of the league ncaa 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.870
 hold my passage there is a first one 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.130
 banker the little ones I say that but who 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.360
 camp and iodine avoid to so is in 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.720
 big it's him who will work on the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.180
 on my second montage so that's 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.419
 really great editors and nec at m 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.410
 are unrelated in the description 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.570
 do not really go because he 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.250
 made to subscribe guys because he 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.599
 is really he really has talent he 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.979
 is very young it is he who also 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.930
 edited the task team that is available 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.699
 today on his chain of clans the 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.169
 team tech3 case and he really did a 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.419
 great job so what 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.789
 we see there do not hesitate to support them 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.810
 it would really please me and we 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.789
 engrossed the team worked on the 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.650
 Mount second mount and guarantee that it 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.949
 is going to be epic frankly the 15 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.289
 best ladies 2nd bank shot for 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.630
 seventy-four kid according to I was 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.010
 disgusted at not doing it 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.539
 74th and not for the fact that he's camping on the chin 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.960
 pinaquy term the next apparel so 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.930
 it's cool 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.689
 and so here I just swear by it 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.399
 report to August 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.509
 we live an epic moment I think 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:51.129
 I really have a lot of clips 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.389
 already picked a few songs we have 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.679
 shot some cutscenes and y 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.989
 normally it will be available the week 

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:58.419
 next before dlc so it seems to me 

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:59.799
 that the dlc comes out Thursday, April 3 are 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.239
 seems odd by the way that sort of a 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.929
 Thursday 

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:04.809
 I would have thought it would be a marc 

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:06.860
