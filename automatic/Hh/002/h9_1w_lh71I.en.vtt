00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello today we want you the first 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.130
 steps show how you your dog that 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 could teach backward parking 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910
 Parking backwards means that the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.940
 dog running aground occurs 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 one turn 180 degrees and then backwards 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 running through your own legs and how 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760
 one builds up this exercise that we show 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.980
 you in this video namely the part 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.050
 One to how do I bring the dog that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.789
 reverse parking at we build that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.310
 command from behind and the goal of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.689
 Today is that the dog is in front of you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.289
 and the entire route backwards 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.640
 running through the legs we start the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.710
 Exercise your dog with something 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 Lining through our legs then lure 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 It will be back soon 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.070
 Drawn underground should be hand 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.250
 want 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 After that, he will immediately be rewarded with food 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 The hand is really important 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
 quickly pull back so that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.210
 Dog does not come up with the idea 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 to go along 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 I also use a marker 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.070
 there namely the word jessica roos after 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.070
 moved behind 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.149
 do not pay attention to the dog at the beginning 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.280
 to pull too far forward and flyer 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.809
 and so should ask ikarus 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.159
 you can just shake my hand right now 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 still take my form and again 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 give back to the back 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.500
 Here you see again that you the dog 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the beginning really not far forward 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 then pull your hand backwards 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.580
 panning and the dog should go 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580
 lay behind 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.440
 as soon as it works well we can do that 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.050
 dog a bit further down to about 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.860
 shoulder height pull forward the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.450
 but then hand movement remains anyway 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.740
 the same so the hand away quickly 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740
 take and pull backwards 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.700
 if that works great up to the shoulder 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 then you can start dog even further 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.539
 to go forward so about until 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.950
 go through to the hind legs and then 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.950
 again the hand pivot rearwardly 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.360
 below you log your dog step for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.579
 Step forward to the front 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.060
 you stand and then the complete way 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.429
 We walk backwards through your legs 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 In the second strategy to build in that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.220
 in the second part you will learn about the topic 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 parking the dog backwards 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.519
 I teach you the video here 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.720
 as well as in the infobox linked if 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.220
 Now that your dog is looking for you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.630
 then teach another round of trick 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.340
 can you click here above the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.099
 customers at rain respectively 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.080
 I'm dead or up here 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.819
 there you can turn down your on 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 to teach the job and do you want 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.060
 on more videos of us are here 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.560
 a canine channel around the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
 For example, dog busy means that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.000
 Education that teaches the tricks 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.799
 and funny stories around in 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 everyday with the dog then you can us
