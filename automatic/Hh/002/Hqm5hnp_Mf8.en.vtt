00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.660
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.790
 I bring a new versus good I did this 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.800
 video on request of the subscriber but 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.740
 also because the powers of these 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.900
 characters are very even so 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.600
 this versus will be between I go to the hundred 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.850
 hundred versus the perfect first that 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.310
 I do not want to tell you what I said 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.230
 in your hundred time state since that is what 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.150
 more fair because in my opinion 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 bojan would give him fight makes the perfect 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 just using your one hundred percent good without 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.730
 nothing more to say let's start 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.730
 is a galactic pirate is both his power 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.980
 of destruction that years ago the 4 fell 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.440
 healthy they had to stop him alone 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.270
 sealing the good this villain we 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.430
 showed a lot of power and skill in the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.110
 battlefield beating trump and 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.330
 vegeta in state super sayayin 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.829
 defeating peak gold and in his state 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.439
 100% could dominate agoyán very easily 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.020
 this super android is very powerful capable 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.509
 of defeating vegueta to overcome trump in 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.790
 his state of shanghai and proved to be a 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.189
 little more powerful than the super sayayin 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 full palette this villain has variety 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.509
 of deadly techniques thanks to the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.280
 cells that also has many 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.039
 useful skills in the field of 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 battle but who would win between these 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.420
 two super bad villains this fight is 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.159
 very difficult since the two showed 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.470
 be almost the same level 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.170
 so I would give a draw to this 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.600
 versus but in a fight to the death where 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.090
 everything is worth I believe that the winner would be 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.149
 happy since he has a very advantage 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.220
 large which is to be rebuilt and that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.259
 would help a lot in this fight besides 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.569
 that we were shown more skills than 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.220
 boyacá so I would put this 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:58.190
 55 of 45% giving as winner 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.530
 the perfect and good friends that was all 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.149
 my theory if you liked the video do not you 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.700
 forget to give thumbs up and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.770
 subscribe comments for you who would be 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.110
 the winner of this fight and if you want 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 more versus just lose melo in the box 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.290
