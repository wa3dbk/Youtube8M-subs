00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
been around for about ten years and a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.330 
been around for about ten years and a
new<00:00:26.150> sort<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:26.750> Edition<00:00:27.170> is<00:00:27.320> digital<00:00:27.769> literacy

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
new sort of Edition is digital literacy

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.120 
new sort of Edition is digital literacy
well<00:00:29.269> I<00:00:29.300> think<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.470> that<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:30.680> can<00:00:30.859> build

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
well I think it's so that you can build

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.560 
well I think it's so that you can build
on<00:00:31.279> top<00:00:31.490> of<00:00:31.550> them<00:00:31.789> if<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.029> don't<00:00:32.149> start<00:00:32.449> off

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
on top of them if you don't start off

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.689 
on top of them if you don't start off
with<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.780> strong<00:00:33.410> foundation<00:00:33.679> of<00:00:34.309> knowledge

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
with a strong foundation of knowledge

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.759 
with a strong foundation of knowledge
and<00:00:34.909> skills<00:00:35.269> it's<00:00:35.659> very<00:00:35.870> hard<00:00:36.109> then<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.559> put

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
and skills it's very hard then to put

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.189 
and skills it's very hard then to put
more<00:00:37.429> on<00:00:37.639> top<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:38.269> so<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:38.929> think<00:00:38.960> the

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
more on top of that so I think the

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.399 
more on top of that so I think the
foundation<00:00:39.679> skills<00:00:39.979> can<00:00:40.729> help<00:00:40.969> people<00:00:41.149> to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
foundation skills can help people to

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.410 
foundation skills can help people to
begin<00:00:42.409> a<00:00:42.589> learning<00:00:42.949> journey<00:00:43.249> but<00:00:43.699> also<00:00:43.909> it

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
begin a learning journey but also it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.819 
begin a learning journey but also it
gives<00:00:44.629> them<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.809> confidence<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.469> thing

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
gives them the confidence a thing

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.489 
gives them the confidence a thing
actually<00:00:46.609> I<00:00:46.639> can<00:00:46.819> do<00:00:46.999> this<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:47.600> I'm<00:00:48.049> okay<00:00:48.440> to

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
actually I can do this and I'm okay to

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.259 
actually I can do this and I'm okay to
do<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.129> next<00:00:49.339> one<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.549> the<00:00:49.699> next<00:00:49.850> one<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.209> I

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
do the next one and the next one so I

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.819 
do the next one and the next one so I
think<00:00:50.329> they<00:00:50.539> give<00:00:50.719> people<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:51.139> confidence<00:00:51.679> to

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
think they give people a confidence to

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.219 
think they give people a confidence to
start<00:00:52.039> with<00:00:52.249> as<00:00:52.399> well<00:00:52.609> some<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.539> us<00:00:53.809> we<00:00:53.959> take<00:00:54.109> it

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
start with as well some of us we take it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.229 
start with as well some of us we take it
for<00:00:54.350> granted<00:00:54.379> basic<00:00:55.309> skills<00:00:55.639> but<00:00:55.760> they're<00:00:56.059> not

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
for granted basic skills but they're not

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.239 
for granted basic skills but they're not
they're<00:00:56.659> actually<00:00:56.959> skills<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.679> not<00:00:57.859> a<00:00:58.069> lot

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
they're actually skills that not a lot

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.099 
they're actually skills that not a lot
of<00:00:58.399> people<00:00:58.639> learn<00:00:58.969> depending<00:00:59.779> on<00:00:59.869> you<00:01:00.019> know

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
of people learn depending on you know

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.919 
of people learn depending on you know
when<00:01:00.499> they<00:01:00.679> finish<00:01:00.979> school<00:01:01.359> or<00:01:02.359> if<00:01:02.569> they<00:01:02.719> even

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
when they finish school or if they even

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.539 
when they finish school or if they even
actually<00:01:03.229> went<00:01:03.559> through<00:01:03.649> schooling<00:01:04.190> system

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
actually went through schooling system

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.920 
actually went through schooling system
at<00:01:04.670> all<00:01:04.790> that<00:01:04.970> taught<00:01:05.180> those<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.689> skills

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
at all that taught those kind of skills

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.349 
at all that taught those kind of skills
so<00:01:06.289> we<00:01:06.710> take<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.039> for<00:01:07.189> granted<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:07.880> those

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
so we take that for granted but those

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.670 
so we take that for granted but those
are<00:01:08.600> very<00:01:08.630> important<00:01:09.140> skills<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.469> need<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
are very important skills that need to
