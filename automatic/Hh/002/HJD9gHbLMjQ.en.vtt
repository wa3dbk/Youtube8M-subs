the flag the enemy if it's only one team

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.300 
the flag the enemy if it's only one team
has<00:00:26.000> to<00:00:26.150> capture<00:00:26.449> flag<00:00:26.689> each<00:00:26.960> round<00:00:27.320> right<00:00:28.189> now

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
has to capture flag each round right now

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.099 
has to capture flag each round right now
the<00:00:28.400> enemy<00:00:28.730> has<00:00:28.880> capture<00:00:29.269> our<00:00:29.300> flag<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:29.990> our

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
the enemy has capture our flag so our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.050 
the enemy has capture our flag so our
flags<00:00:30.320> in<00:00:30.500> an<00:00:30.619> area<00:00:30.800> they<00:00:31.490> have<00:00:31.580> to<00:00:31.699> capture<00:00:31.910> it

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
flags in an area they have to capture it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.209 
flags in an area they have to capture it
and<00:00:32.210> take<00:00:32.419> it<00:00:32.450> back<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.719> our<00:00:32.960> fly<00:00:33.260> I'm<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:34.010> back

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
and take it back to our fly I'm to back

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.430 
and take it back to our fly I'm to back
to<00:00:34.399> their<00:00:34.610> area<00:00:35.030> before<00:00:35.480> time<00:00:35.719> runs<00:00:35.960> up<00:00:36.230> I

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
to their area before time runs up I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.360 
to their area before time runs up I
think<00:00:37.250> it's<00:00:37.399> like<00:00:37.610> two<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.719> half<00:00:38.870> minutes

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
think it's like two and a half minutes

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.950 
think it's like two and a half minutes
lay<00:00:40.370> could<00:00:40.789> be<00:00:40.910> wrong<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:41.180> it's<00:00:41.539> around<00:00:41.750> that

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
lay could be wrong but it's around that

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.630 
lay could be wrong but it's around that
time<00:00:42.170> oh<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.489> it's<00:00:44.149> kind<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.510> hard<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.289> not<00:00:45.680> if

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
time oh and it's kind of hard but not if

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.180 
time oh and it's kind of hard but not if
the<00:00:46.789> enemy<00:00:47.120> gets<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.480> flag<00:00:47.809> then<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.920> have<00:00:49.039> to

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
the enemy gets the flag then you have to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.979 
the enemy gets the flag then you have to
stand<00:00:49.399> on<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.820> flagon<00:00:50.210> right<00:00:50.570> here<00:00:50.750> I'm<00:00:50.840> just

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
stand on the flagon right here I'm just

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.660 
stand on the flagon right here I'm just
failing<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:51.829> have<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.039> stand<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:52.489> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
failing but you have to stand on the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.580 
failing but you have to stand on the
flag<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.809> have<00:00:53.899> stand<00:00:54.170> on<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.410> for<00:00:54.530> a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
flag and you have stand on it for a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.080 
flag and you have stand on it for a
while<00:00:54.649> there's<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.129> little<00:00:55.219> bar<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.910> more

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
while there's a little bar the more

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.330 
while there's a little bar the more
people<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:56.359> stand<00:00:56.690> on<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.050> flag<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.980> faster

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
people that stand on the flag the faster

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.759 
people that stand on the flag the faster
goes<00:00:58.579> but<00:00:59.510> there's<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.870> little<00:00:59.989> bar<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.620> goes

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
goes but there's a little bar that goes

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.259 
goes but there's a little bar that goes
down<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.340> what<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.519> does<00:01:01.609> then<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.940> returns

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
down and what it does then it returns

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.960 
down and what it does then it returns
the<00:01:02.449> flag<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:04.190> actually<00:01:04.520> really<00:01:04.820> hard

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the flag so it's actually really hard

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.460 
the flag so it's actually really hard
for<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.420> people<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.780> are<00:01:05.840> trying<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.140> defend

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
for the people that are trying to defend

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.820 
for the people that are trying to defend
the<00:01:06.530> flag<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.730> enemy<00:01:08.090> took<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.450> flag

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the flag if the the enemy took the flag

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.740 
the flag if the the enemy took the flag
so<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:10.220> lost<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.580> first<00:01:10.790> round<00:01:10.970> we're<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:11.690> 0

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
so we lost the first round we're now 0

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.310 
so we lost the first round we're now 0
and<00:01:12.200> 1<00:01:12.410> you<00:01:13.310> score<00:01:13.640> soon<00:01:13.910> as<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.420> end<00:01:14.600> as<00:01:15.080> soon

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
and 1 you score soon as the end as soon

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.900 
and 1 you score soon as the end as soon
as<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:15.590> your<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.070> flag<00:01:16.340> back<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.760> your

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
as you get your the flag back to your

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.690 
as you get your the flag back to your
base<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.390> win<00:01:17.680> doesn't<00:01:18.680> go<00:01:18.920> any<00:01:19.070> longer<00:01:19.250> so

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
base you win doesn't go any longer so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.540 
base you win doesn't go any longer so
and<00:01:20.030> there<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.450> think<00:01:20.900> four<00:01:21.170> rounds<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
and there I think four rounds so the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.770 
and there I think four rounds so the
most<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.090> could<00:01:23.210> score<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:25.780> probably

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
most you could score like it probably

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870 
most you could score like it probably
three<00:01:27.290> because<00:01:27.740> then<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.220> would<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:28.520> end

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
three because then it would just end

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.150 
three because then it would just end
because<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.330> already<00:01:29.450> won<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.100> did

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
because you already won so what I did

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.540 
because you already won so what I did
die<00:01:31.460> right<00:01:31.640> there<00:01:32.650> I'm<00:01:33.650> not<00:01:33.980> gonna<00:01:34.220> capture

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
die right there I'm not gonna capture

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.020 
die right there I'm not gonna capture
the<00:01:34.790> flag<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.690> enjoy<00:01:36.200> stockpile<00:01:36.860> more<00:01:37.250> um

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
the flag I I enjoy stockpile more um

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.090 
the flag I I enjoy stockpile more um
have<00:01:38.840> some<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.110> flags<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.740> lot<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.890> stuff

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
have some more flags and a lot of stuff

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.580 
have some more flags and a lot of stuff
but<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.520> uh<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:41.720> kind<00:01:42.500> of

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
but this uh this is just kind of

this
um<00:02:13.530> David<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.959> don't<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.709> well<00:02:17.310> we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
um David I don't know but we do well we

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.970 
um David I don't know but we do well we
tie<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.239> win<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:18.780> do<00:02:18.930> tie<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
tie we don't win but we do tie and the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.070 
tie we don't win but we do tie and the
score<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.430> 0<00:02:23.459> 0<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.390> some<00:02:24.540> reason<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
score is actually 0 0 for some reason I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.440 
score is actually 0 0 for some reason I
think<00:02:25.620> that's<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.099> round<00:02:26.370> i<00:02:26.519> guess<00:02:26.700> i<00:02:27.000> don't

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
think that's this round i guess i don't

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.070 
think that's this round i guess i don't
know<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.700> i<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.569> i<00:02:30.599> know<00:02:31.049> about

the flag back and right here as you can
see<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.230> base<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.739> what<00:02:59.250> i

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
see that's all the base so what i

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
see that's all the base so what i
usually<00:02:59.459> doing<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.239> camp<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.629> their

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
usually doing this is I camp out their

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.119 
usually doing this is I camp out their
base<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.379> even<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.799> they<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.099> past

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
base that way even if they get past

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.580 
base that way even if they get past
everyone<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.910> my<00:03:03.030> team<00:03:05.060> they<00:03:06.060> will<00:03:06.410> get<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
everyone on my team they will get the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710 
everyone on my team they will get the
flag<00:03:07.859> there<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:09.030> while<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.510> our

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
flag there and right here while this our

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.660 
flag there and right here while this our
base<00:03:09.900> actually<00:03:10.290> let's<00:03:10.829> protect<00:03:11.129> an<00:03:11.310> Arby's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
base actually let's protect an Arby's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.819 
base actually let's protect an Arby's
but<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.329> there<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.599> did<00:03:12.780> score<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.319> also<00:03:14.299> so

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
but right there we did score to also so

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.890 
but right there we did score to also so
this<00:03:16.829> game<00:03:17.099> type<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.549> kind<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.359> not<00:03:18.540> fun

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
this game type is kind of it's not fun

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.890 
this game type is kind of it's not fun
at<00:03:19.560> least<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.950> don't<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.430> fun<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
at least I don't think it's fun if you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.870 
at least I don't think it's fun if you
have<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.049> dominating<00:03:22.769> team<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.370> should<00:03:23.609> win

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
have a dominating team you should win

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.509 
have a dominating team you should win
it's<00:03:24.720> not<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.139> hard<00:03:25.319> all<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.069> want<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it's not that hard all you want to do is

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.909 
it's not that hard all you want to do is
make<00:03:26.549> sure<00:03:26.730> they<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.000> take<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.620> flag<00:03:28.620> but

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
out of it it pissed me off but here I

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.090 
out of it it pissed me off but here I
get<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.050> flag<00:06:44.290> and<00:06:44.530> I've<00:06:44.650> run<00:06:44.830> it<00:06:44.979> up<00:06:45.070> the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
get the flag and I've run it up the

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.740 
get the flag and I've run it up the
steps<00:06:45.400> because<00:06:45.669> you<00:06:45.850> can't<00:06:46.060> use<00:06:46.210> your<00:06:46.240> ability

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
steps because you can't use your ability

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.450 
steps because you can't use your ability
when<00:06:46.900> holding<00:06:47.199> flags<00:06:47.410> kind<00:06:47.919> of<00:06:48.009> sucks<00:06:48.220> but<00:06:48.400> I

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
when holding flags kind of sucks but I

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.820 
when holding flags kind of sucks but I
guess<00:06:48.520> that's<00:06:48.850> okay<00:06:49.270> because<00:06:49.990> then<00:06:50.500> I<00:06:50.530> can't

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
guess that's okay because then I can't

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.350 
guess that's okay because then I can't
just<00:06:50.949> like<00:06:51.130> use<00:06:51.310> the<00:06:51.430> jetpack<00:06:51.820> and<00:06:51.850> fly<00:06:52.210> away

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
just like use the jetpack and fly away

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.510 
just like use the jetpack and fly away
with<00:06:52.479> it<00:06:52.810> but<00:06:53.440> I<00:06:53.470> beat<00:06:53.740> him<00:06:53.860> down<00:06:54.070> with<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.340> fly

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
with it but I beat him down with the fly

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.010 
with it but I beat him down with the fly
and<00:06:54.789> I<00:06:54.880> didn't<00:06:55.150> realize<00:06:55.360> the<00:06:55.509> guy<00:06:55.660> right<00:06:55.960> there
