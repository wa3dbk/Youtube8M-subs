best Fantastic Four movie now you know I
think<00:02:01.390> see<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.660> involves<00:02:02.020> better<00:02:02.260> ever

think see that involves better ever

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.280 
think see that involves better ever
watching<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:07.360> taking<00:02:07.750> bets<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.140> whether

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
watching it we're taking bets on whether

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.260 
watching it we're taking bets on whether
the<00:02:08.530> waitress<00:02:08.950> knows<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.429> name<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:10.060> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.660 

so<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.920> Invisible<00:02:25.920> Woman<00:02:26.100> slam

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
so this is the Invisible Woman slam

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.240 
so this is the Invisible Woman slam
where<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.240> have<00:02:27.420> CIA<00:02:28.290> nesting<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.070> hash<00:02:29.220> browns

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
where we have CIA nesting of hash browns

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.600 
where we have CIA nesting of hash browns
one<00:02:30.030> pizza<00:02:30.720> picking<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.650> sausage<00:02:32.130> which

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
one pizza picking in one sausage which

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.400 
one pizza picking in one sausage which
doesn't<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.300> much<00:02:33.540> sense<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.930> me

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
doesn't make much sense to me
