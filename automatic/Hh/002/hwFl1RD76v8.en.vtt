00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.730
 that's where from why 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.890
 caps 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.820
 that's the way here 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.820
 failure and sewn 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.500
 ready to be cap 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:29.310
 Now I understand that for this hat 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 she will refer to this too for this hat 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.840
 I am now seeing a hike on the inside for this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 here for this part so which 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.030
 occipital I typed 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.250
 I scored 90 needles on 1 fan tied 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.190
 40 rows 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.690
 40 rows this is this part this part 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:06.580
 I am now connected further I typed here 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.010
 this is the way observed Volodya 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.070
 needle and lied 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.110
 48 more loops and everything turned out 138 5 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.360
 that is, first I disappeared this part 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.510
 then now I will show you how to type 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.750
 here this part before we will all 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:35.350
 knit together in a straight line one hundred thirty 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:39.580
 eight rows I started here are the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 the part I've already done is called on 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.850
 will ask 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:51.170
 Here I have a loop I set out 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.020
 for head and cling turns loop 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.320
 farther alive again 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.130
 and here and how to entangle and what 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:10.479
 needle here these loops way 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.479
 video scored but the last lips 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.189
 when we do not have at least 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 a little bit 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:41.430
 for that cling we will endow here on these 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:46.639
 here are places you can wear here are two 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.639
 cats now 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:03:00.989
 and wish we can already 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.270
 gas carrier weave on and on at the counter 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:22.050
 I have three rows around the cap would be happy 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.050
 and lining 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.670
 Total 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.250
 so a hundred and forty four rows first we 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.560
 tied up 40 rows 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.960
 this is this part of the cream series and this 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.980
 with it , we still have to tie 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.750
 do not link 138 asos 44 in a straight line 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.970
 loop close on the auxiliary thread 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.640
 like me 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.640
 if I have auxiliary branches
