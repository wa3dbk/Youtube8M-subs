sad about it because I wouldn't but not
in<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.769> immediate<00:02:41.389> future<00:02:42.389> anyway<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> want<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
only been just over two years and it's

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:56.690 
only been just over two years and it's
still<00:02:50.489> quite<00:02:50.790> raw<00:02:51.829> so<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:53.510> don't<00:02:54.510> want<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.700> get

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
still quite raw so I don't want to get

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.860 
still quite raw so I don't want to get
into<00:02:57.000> anything<00:02:57.739> straight<00:02:58.739> away<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.629> that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
into anything straight away so that's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.420 
into anything straight away so that's
basically<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:03.049> reasons<00:03:04.049> I'm<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.590> I'm<00:03:05.129> sure

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
basically the reasons I'm going I'm sure

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.250 
basically the reasons I'm going I'm sure
there's<00:03:05.669> a<00:03:05.760> lot<00:03:05.939> more<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.209> can't<00:03:06.599> think<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.079> at

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.509 
there's a lot more I can't think of at
the<00:03:07.349> moment<00:03:08.629> but<00:03:09.629> I<00:03:10.379> think<00:03:10.859> they're<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.370> good

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
the moment but I think they're as good

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:20.509 
the moment but I think they're as good
as<00:03:11.669> any<00:03:11.849> for<00:03:12.450> anybody<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.930> right<00:03:19.519> so

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
as any for anybody and right so

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:29.410
