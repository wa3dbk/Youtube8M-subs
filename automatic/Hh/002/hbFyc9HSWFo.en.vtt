was<00:02:45.820> from<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.180> button<00:02:46.750> then<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:47.740> see

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
was from the button then I think I see

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.380 
was from the button then I think I see
that's<00:02:48.010> quite<00:02:48.190> importantly<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.240> leave

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
that's quite importantly so you leave

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.650 
that's quite importantly so you leave
the<00:02:49.540> hole<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> button<00:02:51.330> there's<00:02:52.330> only<00:02:52.510> one

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
the hole for the button there's only one

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
the hole for the button there's only one
button<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.050> front<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.380> course<00:02:56.550> it´s<00:02:57.550> well

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
button on the front of course it´s well

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.370 
button on the front of course it´s well
aligned<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> tricky<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:01.930> as<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
aligned now this is a tricky bit as the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.720 
aligned now this is a tricky bit as the
air<00:03:02.470> friction<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.830> really<00:03:03.040> good<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.520> see

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
air friction is really good I can see

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:22.000 
air friction is really good I can see
the<00:03:03.940> air<00:03:04.330> bubbles<00:03:04.360> there

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.150 

we<00:03:22.670> need<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.849> bit<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.000> patience<00:03:23.420> today<00:03:24.040> let's<00:03:25.040> do

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
we need a bit of patience today let's do

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.070 
we need a bit of patience today let's do
it<00:03:25.250> slowly

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
it slowly

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.410 
it slowly
sometimes<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.530> lift<00:03:28.250> lift<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.879> on<00:03:28.970> up

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
sometimes you have to lift lift it on up

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.360 
sometimes you have to lift lift it on up
again<00:03:29.810> winters<00:03:30.379> to<00:03:30.470> see<00:03:30.680> whether<00:03:30.890> he<00:03:31.010> does<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
again winters to see whether he does it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.420 
again winters to see whether he does it
yeah<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> put<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.530> up<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> bit<00:03:33.769> together<00:03:34.099> those

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
yeah so put it up a bit together those

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.460 
yeah so put it up a bit together those
final<00:03:34.910> bubbles<00:03:35.269> it's<00:03:35.810> quite<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.050> lot<00:03:36.260> at<00:03:36.379> this

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
final bubbles it's quite a lot at this

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:59.800 
final bubbles it's quite a lot at this
end<00:03:37.989> still

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.979 

attempted<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.770> pause<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.130> camera<00:04:01.489> but<00:04:01.989> that's

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
attempted to pause the camera but that's

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.270 
attempted to pause the camera but that's
when<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.230> exciting<00:04:03.500> bits<00:04:03.800> gonna<00:04:03.980> happen

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
when the exciting bits gonna happen

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.690 
when the exciting bits gonna happen
today<00:04:04.459> we're<00:04:04.610> back<00:04:06.040> my<00:04:07.040> battery's<00:04:07.430> run<00:04:07.580> out

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
today we're back my battery's run out

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.490 
today we're back my battery's run out
just<00:04:07.730> then<00:04:08.060> but<00:04:08.270> being<00:04:08.569> well-prepared<00:04:08.959> as<00:04:09.380> I

clutches<00:04:17.680> I'm<00:04:18.680> using<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.370> flip<00:04:19.639> camera<00:04:19.880> with

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
clutches I'm using a flip camera with

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.000 
clutches I'm using a flip camera with
this<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.540> there's<00:04:20.720> an<00:04:20.810> older<00:04:21.079> model<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.560> the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
this and there's an older model and the

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.350 
this and there's an older model and the
nice<00:04:22.160> thing<00:04:22.340> with<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> older<00:04:22.790> models<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.210> they

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
nice thing with the older models is they

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.040 
nice thing with the older models is they
work<00:04:23.570> offer<00:04:23.840> two<00:04:24.290> double-a<00:04:24.650> batteries<00:04:26.050> it's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
work offer two double-a batteries it's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.240 
work offer two double-a batteries it's
not<00:04:27.169> just<00:04:27.380> rechargeable

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
not just rechargeable

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.280 
not just rechargeable
that's<00:04:28.520> where<00:04:28.669> rechargeable<00:04:29.300> would<00:04:29.540> would

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
that's where rechargeable would would

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.310 
that's where rechargeable would would
lose<00:04:30.530> out<00:04:33.520> mister<00:04:34.520> reflections<00:04:35.090> there<00:04:35.330> by

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
lose out mister reflections there by

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.960 
lose out mister reflections there by
trying<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.680> engage<00:04:37.010> liberally<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:37.669> not<00:04:37.820> as

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
trying to engage liberally but not as

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.269 
trying to engage liberally but not as
bad<00:04:38.150> as<00:04:38.330> they<00:04:38.450> were

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:47.279 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.779 

sellotape<00:04:48.279> is<00:04:48.610> obviously<00:04:50.099> critical<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.489> doing

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
sellotape is obviously critical to doing

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:59.680 
sellotape is obviously critical to doing
this

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.810 

you<00:05:00.170> know<00:05:00.290> bacterias<00:05:01.130> video<00:05:01.430> you'll<00:05:01.670> be<00:05:01.700> able

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
you know bacterias video you'll be able

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.340 
you know bacterias video you'll be able
to<00:05:01.940> compare<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.480> amount<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.870> reflect

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
to compare the amount of reflect

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.800 
to compare the amount of reflect
reflections<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.490> actually<00:05:05.180> cut<00:05:05.360> down<00:05:05.390> a<00:05:05.570> lot

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
reflections and actually cut down a lot

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.540 
reflections and actually cut down a lot
now<00:05:07.540> currently<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.630> downside<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.400> doing<00:05:10.400> this

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
now currently the downside of doing this

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.780 
now currently the downside of doing this
is<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.530> losing<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.010> really<00:05:13.280> reflective

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
is and losing the really reflective

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.640 
is and losing the really reflective
screen<00:05:14.030> is<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.810> lose<00:05:15.050> out<00:05:15.260> on<00:05:15.560> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
screen is that you lose out on the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.700 
screen is that you lose out on the
really<00:05:15.920> gene<00:05:16.160> flaps<00:05:16.780> so<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.900> contrast<00:05:18.320> on<00:05:18.560> any

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
really gene flaps so the contrast on any

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.410 
really gene flaps so the contrast on any
video<00:05:19.070> we're<00:05:19.250> looking<00:05:19.520> at<00:05:19.640> is<00:05:19.790> not<00:05:19.940> quite<00:05:20.240> as

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
video we're looking at is not quite as

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.380 
video we're looking at is not quite as
high<00:05:20.630> for<00:05:21.430> me<00:05:22.430> that's<00:05:22.700> not<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.000> debate

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
high for me that's not a debate

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.189 
high for me that's not a debate
I<00:05:23.570> think<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:23.930> is

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.929 

if<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.740> was<00:05:27.860> doing<00:05:28.039> this<00:05:28.189> my<00:05:28.580> heart<00:05:28.789> was<00:05:28.909> just

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:28.939 
if I was doing this my heart was just

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.610 
if I was doing this my heart was just
skipping<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.449> beat<00:05:29.599> now<00:05:29.889> putting<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:31.069> off<00:05:31.159> to

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
skipping a beat now putting it off to

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.080 
skipping a beat now putting it off to
get<00:05:33.620> rid<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.889> those<00:05:33.949> my<00:05:34.189> struggles

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
get rid of those my struggles

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.740 
get rid of those my struggles
well

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
well

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.330 
well
coming<00:05:38.200> up<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.410> long<00:05:38.560> way<00:05:38.740> G<00:05:38.980> ever<00:05:39.100> there's

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:46.999 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.049 

I<00:05:47.529> just<00:05:48.529> realized<00:05:48.919> that<00:05:49.099> two<00:05:49.639> pieces<00:05:49.969> of

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.059 
I just realized that two pieces of

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.019 
I just realized that two pieces of
plastic<00:05:51.309> please<00:05:52.309> ignore<00:05:52.639> some<00:05:52.849> of<00:05:52.939> my
