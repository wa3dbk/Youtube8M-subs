programming<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.759> carry<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.090> lot<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
programming we do carry a lot of the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.330 
programming we do carry a lot of the
dealership<00:00:12.960> software<00:00:13.469> most<00:00:14.040> people<00:00:14.280> don't

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
dealership software most people don't

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.289 
dealership software most people don't
have<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.730> we'll<00:00:14.880> come<00:00:15.000> back<00:00:15.030> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
have it so we'll come back with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.640 
have it so we'll come back with
everything<00:00:15.599> cutting<00:00:15.929> programming<00:00:16.470> back

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
everything cutting programming back

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.460 
everything cutting programming back
shortly

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.189 

hi<00:00:25.470> we're<00:00:25.680> back<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:26.009> this<00:00:26.160> our<00:00:26.340> Camry<00:00:26.990> you<00:00:27.990> put

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
hi we're back at this our Camry you put

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.240 
hi we're back at this our Camry you put
the<00:00:28.349> litter<00:00:28.710> key

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the litter key

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.920 
the litter key
now<00:00:29.669> this<00:00:29.820> job<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.180> kinda<00:00:30.419> interesting<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
now this job is kinda interesting this

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.410 
now this job is kinda interesting this
key<00:00:31.109> looks<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> black<00:00:31.829> key<00:00:32.420> actually

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
key looks like a black key actually

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
key looks like a black key actually
should<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.629> a<00:00:33.750> great<00:00:34.079> key<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
should be a great key but this is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.729 
should be a great key but this is
actually<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> valet<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> we're<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> do

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
actually a valet so we're going to do

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.259 
actually a valet so we're going to do
the<00:00:37.829> onboard<00:00:38.309> programming<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
the onboard programming like some of

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:40.729 
the onboard programming like some of
these<00:00:39.329> structures<00:00:39.750> may<00:00:39.930> tell<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.589> do

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
these structures may tell you you can do

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
these structures may tell you you can do
them<00:00:41.040> definitely<00:00:41.519> need<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> machine<00:00:41.970> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
them definitely need a machine and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.390 
them definitely need a machine and
program<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.920> like<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
program just like we have with the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:55.060 
program just like we have with the
software<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.019> panic<00:00:48.260> t1<00:00:52.250> t2

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
software we do the panic t1 t2

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.289 
software we do the panic t1 t2
let's<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.519> system

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.109 

turn<00:01:00.299> your<00:01:00.479> security<00:01:00.869> light<00:01:01.080> stops<00:01:01.350> flashing

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
turn your security light stops flashing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.469 
turn your security light stops flashing
start<00:01:03.119> right<00:01:03.360> up<00:01:05.000> key<00:01:06.000> number<00:01:06.240> two

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
start right up key number two

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.940 
start right up key number two
screw<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> light<00:01:07.409> flashes<00:01:08.150> wait<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.570> key<00:01:09.810> out

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.140 

to<00:01:13.950> secure<00:01:14.280> light<00:01:14.460> flashing<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to secure light flashing right there on

the<00:01:15.210> dash<00:01:16.549> goes<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.759> starts<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.570> key<00:01:18.930> number

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the dash goes out starts up key number

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
the dash goes out starts up key number
two<00:01:20.090> basically<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.360> customer<00:01:21.780> brought<00:01:21.990> these

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
two basically the customer brought these

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.249 
two basically the customer brought these
two<00:01:22.320> keys<00:01:22.560> online<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.119> uncut<00:01:24.570> who's<00:01:25.049> able

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
two keys online it was uncut who's able

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
two keys online it was uncut who's able
program<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.090> sure<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.480> buy

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
program them so make sure when you buy

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.520 
program them so make sure when you buy
these<00:01:27.690> stuff<00:01:28.110> online

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
these stuff online

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
these stuff online
it<00:01:28.890> comes<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.280> reliable<00:01:29.760> source<00:01:29.820> I've<00:01:30.210> had

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it comes from a reliable source I've had

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.290 
it comes from a reliable source I've had
keys<00:01:30.690> here<00:01:31.400> people<00:01:32.400> bring<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.700> keys<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
keys here people bring the keys that I

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.240 
keys here people bring the keys that I
could<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.750> program<00:01:34.230> for<00:01:34.530> whatever<00:01:34.710> reason

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
could not program for whatever reason

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.480 
could not program for whatever reason
chips<00:01:35.550> are<00:01:35.730> bad<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.490> transmitter

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
chips are bad and I'm the transmitter

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
chips are bad and I'm the transmitter
for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.760> remote<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.270> bad<00:01:39.510> we<00:01:40.470> still<00:01:40.770> charge<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
for the remote so bad we still charge a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
for the remote so bad we still charge a
minimum<00:01:41.570> for<00:01:42.570> cutting<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.350> trying<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
minimum for cutting and trying the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700 
minimum for cutting and trying the
program<00:01:44.370> whether<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> works<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:46.380> not

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
