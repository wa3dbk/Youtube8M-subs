00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 talk new video here on the channel and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.250
 today lives on technology 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.379
 In the first video I told you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.719
 about the colors of the human where specific 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.370
 more or less of the standard of each 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.230
 one of them in today's video I'll tell you 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.230
 You about the life of rabies, come on. 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 the story does not even sing I came back no no 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.190
 ae 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 everyone knows that every year they are 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.640
 launched new medical collections of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.260
 ghetto comes and in 2005 was launched the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 rabbinical block collection that ended 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.860
 changing forever the way we 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.930
 we named our decks in the collection 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.760
 the history of a doctor who 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.010
 passes in a large medieval megalopolis 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 fantastic populated by several lives 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.040
 Each of these beautiful ones represents two 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.000
 of human beings, whether they are relatives or 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.810
 not these guilds respectively are 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.260
 jimmy in blue and black colors the hours 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.220
 blue and white boros 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.250
 red group red celestial green 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 green and white the young black and white 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.060
 here red black and green red 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.520
 and blue civic blue and green and bulgari 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 black green and why it matters 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 nowadays in medic when you speak 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.890
 which has a deck for example the hours 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.830
 this does not mean you have a deck 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.390
 specifically at that time of 2005 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.910
 necessarily with the letters of the block 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 fast and means that you have a 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.350
 blue and white deck for example if you 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.690
 have a black green deck means that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.009
 Do you have a gari gol deck and today 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.479
 players when they refer to a 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.640
 type of deck they have the kind of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.490
 deck in the end he refers specifically 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 these good lives through today's low cut 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.640
 technology is often very practical and 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.450
 This is the message that I had to give. 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.220
 you 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.030
 I hope now the beginners know 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.030
 which is not exactly very fast 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:24.340
 because now I'm logical it's not something 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.319
 but this is only the delay 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.150
 this one is only about technology so that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.610
 There are people who confuse it anyway. 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.600
 so this is it people if you like 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.400
 from today's video 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.500
