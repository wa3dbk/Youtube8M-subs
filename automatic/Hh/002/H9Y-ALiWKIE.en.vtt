is the bridge we just put this out as it
going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.240> out<00:02:43.410> there<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.650> go<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.250> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
going to come out there we go so this is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.250 
going to come out there we go so this is
the<00:02:45.490> bridge<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.600> looks<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:46.900> we<00:02:47.110> got<00:02:47.230> some

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
the bridge and it looks like we got some

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.350 
the bridge and it looks like we got some
sort<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.740> button<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.400> activate<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.240> to

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
sort of button here to activate it or to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.750 
sort of button here to activate it or to
turn<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.840> we've<00:02:50.560> got<00:02:50.770> an<00:02:50.890> input<00:02:51.370> here<00:02:51.550> for

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
turn it on we've got an input here for

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120 
turn it on we've got an input here for
power<00:02:51.970> supply<00:02:52.440> Ethernet<00:02:53.440> connection<00:02:53.920> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
power supply Ethernet connection to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.700 
power supply Ethernet connection to
connect<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.760> our<00:02:54.790> Wi-Fi<00:02:55.570> router<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.470> that's

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
connect it to our Wi-Fi router so that's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.040 
connect it to our Wi-Fi router so that's
really<00:02:57.250> cool<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.690> thought<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.750> was<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:58.990> to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
really cool I thought that was going to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.760 
really cool I thought that was going to
be<00:02:59.110> bigger<00:02:59.410> actually<00:02:59.860> then<00:03:00.340> we've<00:03:00.550> got<00:03:00.580> some

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
be bigger actually then we've got some

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.890 
be bigger actually then we've got some
more<00:03:02.770> instructions<00:03:04.470> about<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.530> bulbs<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
more instructions about the bulbs and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.120 
more instructions about the bulbs and
then<00:03:08.050> we've<00:03:08.170> got<00:03:08.200> another<00:03:08.470> little<00:03:08.650> booklet

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
then we've got another little booklet

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.520 
then we've got another little booklet
here<00:03:09.370> which<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.480> about<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.750> warranty

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
here which is about the warranty

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.190 
here which is about the warranty
wireless<00:03:12.160> specification<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.900> they<00:03:14.020> put<00:03:14.170> that

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
wireless specification so they put that

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.450 
wireless specification so they put that
back<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.100> got<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.280> bulb

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
back in there then we got the bulb

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.750 
back in there then we got the bulb
itself<00:03:16.290> let's<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.500> look<00:03:17.650> at<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.890> bowl<00:03:18.070> now

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
itself let's have a look at the bowl now

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.880 
itself let's have a look at the bowl now
these<00:03:19.180> might<00:03:19.510> sound<00:03:19.780> expensive<00:03:20.050> but<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.740> can

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
these might sound expensive but you can

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.880 
these might sound expensive but you can
buy<00:03:21.280> separate<00:03:21.910> bulbs<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.710> because<00:03:23.710> they're

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
buy separate bulbs and because they're

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.550 
buy separate bulbs and because they're
LED<00:03:24.460> they<00:03:24.700> should<00:03:25.000> last<00:03:25.270> for<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> really<00:03:25.810> long

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
LED they should last for a really long

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.490 
LED they should last for a really long
time<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.850> mean<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.120> long<00:03:28.510> time<00:03:28.780> compared<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
time and I mean a long time compared to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.130 
time and I mean a long time compared to
this<00:03:30.040> or<00:03:30.310> normal<00:03:30.670> bulbs<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.240> buy<00:03:31.420> so

little<00:04:07.480> box<00:04:07.780> up<00:04:08.020> here<00:04:08.410> which<00:04:08.770> has<00:04:09.010> got<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.520> power

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
little box up here which has got a power

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.660 
little box up here which has got a power

this<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.240> going<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.450> be<00:04:13.540> used<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.930> power<00:04:14.170> that

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
this is going to be used to power that

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.950 
this is going to be used to power that
bridge<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.910> I'm<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.330> get<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:16.660> set<00:04:16.930> up
