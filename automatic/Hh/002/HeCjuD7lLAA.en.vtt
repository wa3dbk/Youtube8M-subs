00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
so obviously the ml is not a car that is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.220 
so obviously the ml is not a car that is
afraid<00:02:02.900> of<00:02:03.050> water<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.730> show<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.940> how

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
daring it is with regards to water I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.480 
daring it is with regards to water I
want<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.690> go<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.110> little<00:02:09.440> bit<00:02:09.619> closer<00:02:09.830> by

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
want to go a little bit closer by

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:21.720 
want to go a little bit closer by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.210 

now<00:02:22.730> that's<00:02:23.450> pretty<00:02:23.720> close<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.110> water<00:02:24.319> pretty

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
now that's pretty close to water pretty

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:34.360 
now that's pretty close to water pretty
much<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.610> American<00:02:26.090> beer

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
mean for ting a little bit of water but

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.260 
mean for ting a little bit of water but
it's<00:02:39.780> also<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:41.100> angles<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:41.970> car

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's also at what angles can this car

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.850 
it's also at what angles can this car
stand<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.880> cope<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
stand and what can you cope with and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.540 
stand and what can you cope with and
here<00:02:48.080> yeah<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.830> small

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
here yeah we do have some small

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.180 
here yeah we do have some small
challenges<00:02:51.300> I'm<00:02:52.290> already<00:02:52.470> feeling<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.100> I'm

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
challenges I'm already feeling that I'm

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.479 
challenges I'm already feeling that I'm
sliding<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.200> seems<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.680> no<00:02:55.980> problem

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
sliding but it seems to be no problem

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.330 
sliding but it seems to be no problem
for<00:02:56.520> this<00:02:56.819> car<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.239> all

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.830 

so<00:03:01.340> let's<00:03:01.550> check<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.000> traction<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
so let's check out the traction of the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.460 
so let's check out the traction of the
car<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.459> it's<00:03:04.459> quite<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> steep<00:03:05.090> hill<00:03:05.330> now<00:03:06.319> I'm

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
car and it's quite a steep hill now I'm

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.300 
car and it's quite a steep hill now I'm
leaning<00:03:06.650> backwards<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:08.120> working<00:03:08.569> hard<00:03:09.310> but

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
leaning backwards it's working hard but

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.790 
leaning backwards it's working hard but
it<00:03:10.430> seems<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.760> be<00:03:10.849> no<00:03:11.060> problem<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.110> I'm<00:03:12.500> stuck

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
it seems to be no problem and I'm stuck

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.479 
it seems to be no problem and I'm stuck
in<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.980> hole<00:03:13.129> no<00:03:13.340> I'm<00:03:13.489> not<00:03:18.040> now<00:03:19.040> comes<00:03:19.280> a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
in a hole no I'm not now comes a

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.110 
in a hole no I'm not now comes a
slightly<00:03:20.030> challenging<00:03:20.810> part<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:22.340> big<00:03:22.819> holes

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
slightly challenging part for big holes

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.449 
slightly challenging part for big holes
on<00:03:24.760> each<00:03:25.760> side<00:03:26.060> respectively<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:28.280> just

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
on each side respectively and we just

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.360 
on each side respectively and we just
have<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.670> find<00:03:28.819> out<00:03:29.060> Candice<00:03:29.870> thing<00:03:30.140> dance

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:48.380 

Oh

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.090 

gotta<00:03:49.390> develop<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.930> lot<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.350> feeling<00:03:50.740> for<00:03:50.890> this

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
gotta develop a lot of feeling for this

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.820 
gotta develop a lot of feeling for this
Oh

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:10.050 

take<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:55.640> nice<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:55.880> slow<00:04:01.720> nice<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.780> slow<00:04:03.200> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.670 

tell<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.300> costs<00:04:11.690> more<00:04:11.870> concentration

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
tell you this costs more concentration

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.070 
tell you this costs more concentration
than<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:13.070> racetrack<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.410> think<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:15.800> made<00:04:16.010> it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
than a racetrack and I think we made it

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.890 
than a racetrack and I think we made it
whoo<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:19.060> really<00:04:20.060> made<00:04:20.330> me<00:04:20.359> break<00:04:20.660> some

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
whoo that really made me break some

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.220 
whoo that really made me break some
sweat<00:04:25.180> we're<00:04:26.180> gonna<00:04:26.270> try<00:04:26.540> another<00:04:26.780> descent

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
sweat we're gonna try another descent

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.050 
sweat we're gonna try another descent
but<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.680> time<00:04:27.920> we're<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.700> really

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
but this time we're going to be really

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.970 
but this time we're going to be really
lazy<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:30.200> car<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.680> intelligent

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
lazy because this car is so intelligent

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.700 
lazy because this car is so intelligent
it<00:04:31.610> has<00:04:31.760> something<00:04:32.120> called<00:04:32.200> down<00:04:33.200> speed

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
it has something called down speed

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.590 
it has something called down speed
regulation<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:35.180> means<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.920> turn<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.070> on<00:04:37.160> I

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
regulation that means I turn it on I

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.030 
regulation that means I turn it on I
don't<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.840> do<00:04:38.960> anything<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.560> will<00:04:39.680> go

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
don't have to do anything it will go

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040 
don't have to do anything it will go
constantly<00:04:40.640> at<00:04:41.090> three<00:04:41.330> kilometers<00:04:41.780> per<00:04:41.870> hour

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
constantly at three kilometers per hour

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.530 
constantly at three kilometers per hour
and<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.650> can<00:04:42.800> take<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.100> foot<00:04:43.340> off<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:44.240> brakes

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
and I can take the foot off the brakes

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.140 
and I can take the foot off the brakes
and<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:45.380> will<00:04:45.500> remain<00:04:45.860> constantly<00:04:46.670> in<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:46.940> at

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
and it will remain constantly in that at

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.060 
and it will remain constantly in that at
that<00:04:47.330> speed<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.050> just<00:04:48.260> have<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.530> use<00:04:48.920> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
that speed so I just have to use the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.800 
that speed so I just have to use the
steering<00:04:49.370> wheel<00:04:49.520> let's<00:04:49.790> give<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:50.030> try<00:04:50.180> let's

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
steering wheel let's give it a try let's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.490 
steering wheel let's give it a try let's
see<00:04:51.080> we're<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.530> 23<00:04:52.070> 29<00:04:52.970> 30<00:04:53.630> thirty-three
