hello guys has gone my name is darren
and<00:00:15.960> today<00:00:16.020> i'll<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.500> talking<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.890> shadow

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
and today i'll be talking about shadow

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.460 
and today i'll be talking about shadow
flexion<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> feel<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.750> back<00:00:19.050> for

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
flexion and how I feel it's back for

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.260 
flexion and how I feel it's back for
common<00:00:19.770> rooms<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.520> longest<00:00:20.730> time<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.000> advised

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
common rooms for longest time I advised

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820 
common rooms for longest time I advised
against<00:00:21.840> rolling<00:00:22.170> shadow<00:00:22.380> reflection

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
against rolling shadow reflection

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
against rolling shadow reflection
because<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.160> felt<00:00:23.519> light<00:00:23.699> since<00:00:24.300> our<00:00:24.510> reduction

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
because I felt light since our reduction

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.779 
because I felt light since our reduction
two<00:00:25.109> stones<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.619> not<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.010> viable<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.519> we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
two stones it's not as viable because we

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.120 
two stones it's not as viable because we
can't<00:00:27.029> link<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.720> stone<00:00:28.019> after<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.560> stand<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
can't link a stone after a stand back to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
can't link a stone after a stand back to
back<00:00:29.279> together<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.779> still<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:30.960> viable

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
back together but it's still very viable

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
back together but it's still very viable
for<00:00:31.679> tues<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.610> after<00:00:33.180> watching

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
for tues and actually after watching

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.410 
for tues and actually after watching
some<00:00:33.660> players<00:00:33.899> play<00:00:34.230> mostly<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.520> watch

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
some players play mostly not I watch

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
some players play mostly not I watch
them<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.350> apply<00:00:37.680> shadow

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
them and how they would apply shadow

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650 
them and how they would apply shadow
flexion<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> felt<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> really

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
flexion and I felt it was a really

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
flexion and I felt it was a really
strong<00:00:40.110> cool<00:00:40.350> down<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.649> combat<00:00:41.040> especially

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
strong cool down for combat especially

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
strong cool down for combat especially
in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> 2v2<00:00:42.239> arena<00:00:42.780> scene<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.710> videos

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
in the 2v2 arena scene I got some videos

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
in the 2v2 arena scene I got some videos
for<00:00:44.040> yesterday<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.489> discussion<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> how<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
for yesterday and discussion of how you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
for yesterday and discussion of how you
can<00:00:45.960> apply<00:00:46.079> shadow<00:00:46.500> selection<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.520> yourself

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
can apply shadow selection for yourself

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
can apply shadow selection for yourself
within<00:00:48.180> our<00:00:48.390> Reena<00:00:48.570> settings<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.309> way

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
within our Reena settings so the way

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
within our Reena settings so the way
shadow<00:00:50.700> flexion<00:00:51.090> works<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.050> another

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
shadow flexion works is it's another

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.130 
shadow flexion works is it's another
cool<00:00:52.469> down<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> journal<00:00:53.399> rush<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:54.140> killing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
cool down like a journal rush or killing

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
cool down like a journal rush or killing
spree<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.770> normally<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> combat<00:00:56.789> rogue

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
spree so normally when a combat rogue

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
spree so normally when a combat rogue
opens<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> target<00:00:57.809> you're<00:00:58.199> normally

seconds of stone two seconds afterwards
your<00:01:15.720> shadow<00:01:16.170> flexion<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.650> stun<00:01:16.860> your

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
your shadow flexion will stun your

to<00:01:19.350> notice<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> I've<00:01:20.070> noticed<00:01:20.610> only<00:01:20.729> recently

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to notice is I've noticed only recently

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
internal bleeding last I remember

playing<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.659> shadow<00:01:27.960> flexion<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.500> didn't

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
playing with shadow flexion it didn't

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
playing with shadow flexion it didn't
apply<00:01:29.040> internal<00:01:29.520> bleeding<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> does

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
apply internal bleeding but now it does

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
apply internal bleeding but now it does

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
while this is not a huge change it means

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.060 
while this is not a huge change it means
