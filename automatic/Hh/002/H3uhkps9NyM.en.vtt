00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.830
 explain to you as if we were talking about a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.960
 correct and simple way 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.650
 for this we will need heads and 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.650
 garlic heads 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.219
 remember that if they are purchased in the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.490
 supermarkets usually carry a 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.800
 treatment to avoid germination 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.509
 we will clean them or make possible the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.060
 we will buy in an ecological place where 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.750
 we can verify that they do not carry this 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.080
 treatment 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.010
 let's buy the heads and select 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.010
 the biggest garlic 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.899
 the little ones we will discard or 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.829
 rotten I will proceed to planting and 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.829
 now I explain a little more 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.820
 as you can see and the line is finished 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 I will teach or follow the correct form 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 would be 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 once we break we see a part 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.220
 flat that would be the ass and the piquito 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.870
 this also that will go up 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.060
 we just put them to a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.659
 distance of about 15 centimeters more or 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.090
 less 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.090
 and we make sure they are up 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.300
 the other one equal 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.400
 this land is not very good for garlic 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.820
 but last year's production were 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.210
 little ones but pretty 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 pretty good production 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.310
 so everything is according to the care that you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.460
 let's let the crop remember that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.760
 low irrigation frequency 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.520
 in future videos I will put the evolution and 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.080
 the care of the garlic remember that if 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.000
 you liked what you can share and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.000
 comment and see you in the next 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350
 and
