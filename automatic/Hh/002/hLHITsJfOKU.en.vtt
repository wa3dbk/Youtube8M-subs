00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
touch on there they've got some really

nice<00:02:22.120> patches<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.900> set<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:24.070> was<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
nice patches in this set so that was a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.890 
nice patches in this set so that was a
good<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:24.910> I've<00:02:25.030> actually<00:02:25.210> noticed<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> lot

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
good one and I've actually noticed a lot

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.680 
good one and I've actually noticed a lot
of<00:02:25.930> number<00:02:26.380> 2<00:02:26.500> 599<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.940> believe<00:02:28.150> there<00:02:28.600> may

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
of number 2 599 and I believe there may

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.170 
of number 2 599 and I believe there may
be<00:02:28.720> even<00:02:28.870> some<00:02:29.290> number<00:02:29.560> 27<00:02:30.070> 90<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.460> but<00:02:31.030> this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
be even some number 27 90 on but this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.590 
be even some number 27 90 on but this
one's<00:02:31.420> actually<00:02:31.570> number<00:02:31.990> 3<00:02:32.290> 38<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:32.890> 399<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.570> I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
one's actually number 3 38 of 399 so I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.890 
one's actually number 3 38 of 399 so I
guess<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.140> may<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.410> lower<00:02:35.680> print<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.750> get

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
guess it may be a lower print but to get

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.990 
guess it may be a lower print but to get
two<00:02:38.170> hits<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.590> any<00:02:38.860> retail<00:02:39.310> box<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.790> good

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
two hits out of any retail box is good

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.850 
two hits out of any retail box is good
but<00:02:40.510> especially<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:41.080> get<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.560> i<00:02:41.590> was<00:02:41.830> very
