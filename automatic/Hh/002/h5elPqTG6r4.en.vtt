00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.100 
hey guys what's up its munclesonkey so
for<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.540> thought<00:00:03.780> I'd<00:00:03.929> do<00:00:04.080> a

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
for this video I thought I'd do a

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.590 
for this video I thought I'd do a
progress<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.370> for<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> first<00:00:06.420> time

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
progress video and for the first time

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
progress video and for the first time
I'm<00:00:07.049> kind<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.710> back<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.400> guess<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I'm kind of going back to I guess what I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.610 
I'm kind of going back to I guess what I
did<00:00:09.300> during<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.510> max<00:00:09.809> cape<00:00:10.080> series<00:00:10.410> where<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
did during my max cape series where I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
did during my max cape series where I
recorded<00:00:11.280> clips<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> played<00:00:12.179> them<00:00:12.389> instead

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
recorded clips and played them instead

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.970 
recorded clips and played them instead
of<00:00:12.750> just<00:00:12.990> doing<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.380> kind<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.740> live

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
of just doing any kind of live

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
of just doing any kind of live
commentary<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.509> these<00:00:15.630> clips<00:00:15.960> are<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> guess

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
commentary so these clips are I guess

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
commentary so these clips are I guess
the<00:00:16.800> most<00:00:17.160> interesting<00:00:17.820> things<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the most interesting things that

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.790 
the most interesting things that
happened<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> me<00:00:18.779> during<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.140> past<00:00:19.320> day<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
happened to me during the past day or so

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
happened to me during the past day or so
first<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.000> during<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> farm<00:00:21.660> run<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
first of all during that farm run if you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050 
first of all during that farm run if you
didn't<00:00:22.289> catch<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.710> got<00:00:22.980> 34<00:00:23.430> mill<00:00:23.640> farming

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
didn't catch that I got 34 mill farming

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.179 
didn't catch that I got 34 mill farming
XP<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.350> thought<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.740> kind<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> worth

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
XP and I thought that was kind of worth

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.910 
XP and I thought that was kind of worth
doing<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.199> every<00:00:28.199> 2<00:00:28.349> mil<00:00:28.560> farming

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
doing just because every 2 mil farming

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.710 
doing just because every 2 mil farming
XP<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.000> adventure<00:00:30.449> slog

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
XP that you do you get an adventure slog

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.569 
XP that you do you get an adventure slog
update<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> guess<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.399> little

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
update and I guess it's just a little

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.400 
update and I guess it's just a little
bit<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> progress<00:00:33.000> towards<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.750> 200<00:00:34.290> no

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bit of progress towards that 200 no

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.720 
bit of progress towards that 200 no
farming<00:00:34.800> even<00:00:35.010> though<00:00:35.130> I'll<00:00:35.280> probably<00:00:35.309> never

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
farming even though I'll probably never

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.299 
farming even though I'll probably never
get<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:37.290> next<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.980> bit<00:00:38.160> more

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
get it but next this is a bit more

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
get it but next this is a bit more
exciting<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.969> 85<00:00:39.600> divination<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
exciting this is 85 divination which is

exciting this is 85 divination which is
really<00:00:40.950> cool<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.820> means<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.300> move<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
really cool that means that can move on

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.380 
really cool that means that can move on
to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> next<00:00:42.870> spot<00:00:43.170> no<00:00:43.680> longer<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> stay

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
on 10.4 milder but energy did not sell

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
on 10.4 milder but energy did not sell
for<00:01:05.970> nearly<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.390> much<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.960> said<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.680> sold

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
for nearly as much as it said it sold

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.240 
for nearly as much as it said it sold
for<00:01:08.130> quite<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.970> below<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> GE<00:01:09.600> price<00:01:09.990> so

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
for quite a bit below the GE price so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
for quite a bit below the GE price so
unfortunately<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.340> didn't<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.909> much

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
unfortunately I didn't make as much

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
unfortunately I didn't make as much
money<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.780> could<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.580> selling

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
money as I could have if it was selling

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
money as I could have if it was selling
for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.299> amount<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.470> made

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
for the right amount so the I just made

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.730 
for the right amount so the I just made
my<00:01:16.799> boon<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.380> really<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.470> want<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
my boon there so I really don't want to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.990 
my boon there so I really don't want to
forget<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.970> just

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
forget that again because that just

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
forget that again because that just
means<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.470> bit

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
means it's going to be a little bit

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
means it's going to be a little bit
faster<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> next<00:01:23.909> area<00:01:24.290> anyway<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.409> going

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
faster at the next area anyway I'm going

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
faster at the next area anyway I'm going
to<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> GE<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> sell<00:01:27.030> the

to go to the GE and kind of sell the
energy<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> um<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:29.369> course<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> did

went<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.790> down<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> price<00:01:33.479> where<00:01:33.750> insta

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
went it down to the price where insta

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
went it down to the price where insta
bot<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.680> still<00:01:35.009> would<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.310> its<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.909> sell<00:01:36.150> if

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
bot it still would not its to sell if

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
bot it still would not its to sell if
that<00:01:36.810> makes<00:01:36.990> sense<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that makes sense to you so that was a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
that makes sense to you so that was a
bit<00:01:38.130> unfortunate<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> way

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bit unfortunate but that's just the way

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140 
bit unfortunate but that's just the way
the<00:01:39.960> GE<00:01:40.140> works<00:01:40.500> sometimes<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the GE works sometimes not really a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
the GE works sometimes not really a
whole<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.899> about<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.170> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
whole lot you can do about it but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
whole lot you can do about it but
luckily<00:01:44.399> those<00:01:44.700> energies<00:01:45.090> did<00:01:45.329> cell

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
luckily those energies did cell

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
luckily those energies did cell
overnight<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> did<00:01:46.680> eventually<00:01:47.280> end<00:01:47.759> up

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
overnight so I did eventually end up

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
overnight so I did eventually end up
making<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.479> profit<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> divination<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
making some profit off of divination and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
making some profit off of divination and
I'm<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> continue<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.140> as

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I'm just going to continue to do that as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
I'm just going to continue to do that as
I<00:01:52.590> go<00:01:52.740> through<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.009> levels<00:01:53.310> once<00:01:53.700> i<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:53.970> from

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
I go through the levels once i go from

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
I go through the levels once i go from
85<00:01:54.750> 90<00:01:55.350> i'm<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.280> sell<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
85 90 i'm just going to sell all that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.590 
85 90 i'm just going to sell all that
energy<00:01:57.060> i<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:57.689> care<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:57.990> much

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
energy i don't really care that much

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.330 
energy i don't really care that much
using<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.290> know<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.830> is<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> little<00:02:00.159> bit

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
using it I know it is a little bit

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.219 
using it I know it is a little bit
faster<00:02:00.520> if<00:02:00.939> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.210> use<00:02:01.450> your<00:02:01.479> energy<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:02.110> I'm

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
faster if you do use your energy but I'm

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.109 
faster if you do use your energy but I'm
just<00:02:02.409> going<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.650> sell<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:02.950> because<00:02:03.119> I'm

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
just going to sell it because I'm

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.630 
just going to sell it because I'm
honestly<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.720> all<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.170> stress<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.159> anyway

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
tell for pretty close to here which

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.309 
tell for pretty close to here which
means<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.519> can<00:02:34.000> keep<00:02:34.209> using<00:02:34.450> those<00:02:34.750> Chronicle

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
means I can keep using those Chronicle

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.110 
means I can keep using those Chronicle
fragments<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.950> turn<00:02:36.130> them<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.370> for<00:02:36.400> XP<00:02:36.880> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
after level 85 it's actually pretty good

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120 
after level 85 it's actually pretty good
XP<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.630> turn<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.959> those<00:02:41.050> Chronicle<00:02:41.650> fragments

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
XP to turn in those Chronicle fragments

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.729 
XP to turn in those Chronicle fragments
I've<00:02:42.730> done<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.150> once<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.540> i<00:02:43.600> got<00:02:43.630> about<00:02:43.900> 2,000

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
I've done it once and i got about 2,000

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.979 
I've done it once and i got about 2,000
divination<00:02:45.069> XP<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.360> almost<00:02:46.630> as<00:02:46.840> much

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
divination XP and that's almost as much

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.750 
divination XP and that's almost as much
as<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.200> divination<00:02:47.530> daily<00:02:48.100> challenge<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.640> it's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
as a divination daily challenge and it's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.820 
as a divination daily challenge and it's
like<00:02:48.970> really<00:02:49.269> really<00:02:49.510> easy<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.799> i

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
like really really easy to do so i

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.830 
like really really easy to do so i
figured<00:02:51.160> i<00:02:51.280> might<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.549> well<00:02:51.819> do<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.810> I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
figured i might as well do that but do I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.390 
figured i might as well do that but do I
here's<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> new<00:02:53.380> island<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.830> think<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.220> looks

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
here's the new island I think it looks

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.300 
here's the new island I think it looks
pretty<00:02:54.459> nice<00:02:55.080> they<00:02:56.080> don't<00:02:56.290> give<00:02:56.470> much<00:02:56.739> more<00:02:56.769> XP

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
pretty nice they don't give much more XP

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.850 
pretty nice they don't give much more XP
i<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.880> energies<00:02:58.420> give<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:59.200> 10<00:02:59.410> XP

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
i think the energies give like 10 XP

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.620 
i think the energies give like 10 XP
when<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.130> collect<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.580> instead<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.000> nine<00:03:01.180> XP

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
when you collect them instead of nine XP

make<00:03:08.049> some<00:03:08.350> cool<00:03:08.650> stuff<00:03:08.829> i<00:03:09.100> guess<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> sign<00:03:09.489> of

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
make some cool stuff i guess the sign of

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.630 
make some cool stuff i guess the sign of
the<00:03:09.970> porter<00:03:10.390> 5<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:11.769> might<00:03:12.010> be<00:03:12.160> useful<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the porter 5 that might be useful on

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.430 
the porter 5 that might be useful on
planning<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.150> using<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.900> ever<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.230> some

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
planning on using that if I ever do some

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.289 
planning on using that if I ever do some
Slayer<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.950> stuff<00:03:15.160> because<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.609> can<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
Slayer and stuff because you can you

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.180 
Slayer and stuff because you can you
know<00:03:16.420> bank<00:03:16.720> certain<00:03:17.170> Slayer<00:03:17.500> drops<00:03:17.829> with<00:03:18.010> that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
know bank certain Slayer drops with that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.800 
know bank certain Slayer drops with that
so<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.489> would<00:03:18.579> be<00:03:18.609> really<00:03:18.850> nice<00:03:19.120> when<00:03:19.540> i<00:03:19.570> go

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
