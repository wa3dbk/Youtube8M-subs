00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
hand side you can see the ps3 volt ps3
which<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.840> kept<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> size

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
which I have kept for the size

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.750 
which I have kept for the size
comparison<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:45.570> box<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.079> used<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.890> building

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
comparison the box I used for building

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
comparison the box I used for building
the<00:00:47.910> HTPC<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:50.010> Tek<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:52.379> K<00:00:53.809> 365<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> 65<00:00:56.550> means

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the HTPC is an Tek is K 365 the 65 means

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.220 
the HTPC is an Tek is K 365 the 65 means
it's<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:59.270> 65<00:01:00.270> watts<00:01:00.539> external

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it's going to use 65 watts external

it's going to use 65 watts external
power<00:01:01.440> supply<00:01:05.119> let<00:01:06.119> me<00:01:06.240> show<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> power

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
power supply let me show you the power

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.630 
power supply let me show you the power
supply<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.010> box<00:01:08.250> users<00:01:09.740> which<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
supply the box users which is like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.210 
supply the box users which is like
laptop<00:01:12.570> power<00:01:12.780> supply<00:01:13.970> which<00:01:14.970> uses<00:01:15.860> 65<00:01:16.860> watts

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.990 

how<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:21.150> assume<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.080> power<00:01:22.770> break<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
how now assume the power break so that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:39.370 
how now assume the power break so that
you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.509> take<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> closer<00:01:25.979> look

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.160 

so<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.790> front<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.630> box<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:43.070> have<00:01:44.170> eSATA

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
so the front of the box you have eSATA

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.440 
so the front of the box you have eSATA
port<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.070> 2<00:01:46.820> USB<00:01:47.479> 2<00:01:47.930> port<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.820> headphone<00:01:49.820> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
port and 2 USB 2 port and headphone and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.200 
port and 2 USB 2 port and headphone and
mic<00:01:50.870> jack<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:52.300> you<00:01:53.300> would<00:01:53.450> see<00:01:54.850> reset<00:01:55.850> button

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
mic jack and you would see reset button

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.690 
mic jack and you would see reset button
and<00:01:56.420> power<00:01:56.750> button<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:59.440> this<00:02:00.440> is<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.830> CD

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and power button and this is the CD

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.800 
and power button and this is the CD
drive<00:02:01.970> bypassing<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.229> will<00:02:03.410> open<00:02:03.650> and
