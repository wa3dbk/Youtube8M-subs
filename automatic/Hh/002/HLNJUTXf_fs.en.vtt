00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.730 
I think what could really hurt Animas
program<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.550> lack<00:04:46.759> of<00:04:46.910> speed<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.720> no<00:04:48.319> triple

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
program is a lack of speed and no triple

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.180 
program is a lack of speed and no triple
jumps<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:50.330> now<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> scores<00:04:51.350> again<00:04:51.740> seven

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190
