00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.280 

the<00:01:47.070> techniques<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.850> super<00:01:48.540> weird<00:01:48.780> because

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the techniques it's super weird because

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800 
the techniques it's super weird because
we<00:01:49.440> actually<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> same<00:01:50.310> tools<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.150> same

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.060 
we actually use the same tools and same
techniques<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.130> beginning<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
techniques at the very beginning of this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.270 
techniques at the very beginning of this
this<00:01:56.070> works<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.140> knowledge<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.740> there<00:01:58.770> all

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this works the knowledge is there all

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.680 
this works the knowledge is there all
the<00:01:59.580> new<00:02:00.950> creation<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.190> have<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.850> add<00:02:03.090> every

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
the new creation we have we add every

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.560 
the new creation we have we add every
season<00:02:04.200> comes<00:02:04.890> form<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.390> we

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
season comes form more the way we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
season comes form more the way we
combine<00:02:07.020> things<00:02:07.350> together<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.090> we

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
combine things together the way we

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.850 
combine things together the way we
combine<00:02:09.630> things<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> colors<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
combine things with the colors with the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
combine things with the colors with the
textures<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.730> mixing<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.780> feather<00:02:13.050> rather

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
textures and mixing this feather rather

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.000 
textures and mixing this feather rather
than<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.040> other<00:02:14.900> altogether<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.800> we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
than this other altogether and then we

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.910 
than this other altogether and then we
create<00:02:17.340> new<00:02:17.820> effects<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:19.320> always<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
create new effects but it's always the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800 
create new effects but it's always the
the<00:02:20.310> same<00:02:20.580> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.970> technique<00:02:21.360> we're<00:02:21.570> using

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the same kind of technique we're using

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.400 
the same kind of technique we're using
all<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> time<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:23.130> need<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.550> follow<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
all the time and we need to follow the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.550 
all the time and we need to follow the
advice<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.260> ideas<00:02:28.260> from<00:02:28.470> the

designers as well that bring us drawings

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.420 
designers as well that bring us drawings
and<00:02:31.620> crazy<00:02:33.019> things<00:02:34.019> from<00:02:34.380> their<00:02:34.650> their<00:02:35.130> mind

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430

and<00:02:35.790> by<00:02:36.630> trying<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> translate<00:02:37.830> them<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:39.030> push

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and by trying to translate them we push

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.860 
and by trying to translate them we push
further<00:02:39.810> what<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.560> basically<00:02:41.130> our<00:02:41.370> work<00:02:41.870> every

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
further what is basically our work every

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.090 
further what is basically our work every
time<00:02:44.780> specifically<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> feathers<00:02:46.769> of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
time specifically for the feathers of

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.410 
time specifically for the feathers of
flowers<00:02:47.549> we<00:02:47.880> were<00:02:48.410> over<00:02:49.410> 300<00:02:50.100> people<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:51.180> the

flowers we were over 300 people at the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.380 
flowers we were over 300 people at the
very<00:02:51.660> beginning<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.440> 20th<00:02:52.890> century<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.820> now

very beginning on 20th century and now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440 
very beginning on 20th century and now
we're<00:02:54.780> probably<00:02:55.380> like<00:02:56.040> maybe<00:02:56.910> three<00:02:57.269> or<00:02:57.299> four

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
we're probably like maybe three or four

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.229 
we're probably like maybe three or four
during<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> flowers<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.070> for<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> feathers

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
during the flowers and for the feathers

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.380 
during the flowers and for the feathers
maybe<00:03:00.600> one<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.079> two<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.799> need<00:03:01.980> team<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:03.239> have<00:03:03.329> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
maybe one or two you need team to have a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.930 
maybe one or two you need team to have a
real<00:03:03.690> connection<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.530> what<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.850> not

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
real connection to what you do it's not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.210 
real connection to what you do it's not
only<00:03:06.420> handicraft<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.680> sense<00:03:07.950> that
