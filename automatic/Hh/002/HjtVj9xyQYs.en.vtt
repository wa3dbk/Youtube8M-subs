energy weapons are pretty cool new class

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
energy weapons are pretty cool new class
that<00:00:30.419> we've<00:00:30.539> added<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> game<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.499> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that we've added to the game it's so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.040 
that we've added to the game it's so
powerful<00:00:31.919> so<00:00:32.310> much<00:00:32.640> fun<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.629> of<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.870> we

powerful so much fun on top of that we
have<00:00:34.079> technology<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> hover<00:00:35.430> box<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
have technology like the hover box and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
have technology like the hover box and
the<00:00:36.059> hover<00:00:36.269> tanks<00:00:36.960> things<00:00:37.379> that<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.739> all

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the hover tanks things that can go all

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060 
the hover tanks things that can go all
over<00:00:38.519> terrain<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.329> only<00:00:39.660> hovering<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.350> water

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
over terrain not only hovering on water

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.970 
over terrain not only hovering on water
but<00:00:41.190> hovering<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> land<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:43.199> future<00:00:43.590> tech<00:00:43.769> in

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
but hovering on land the future tech in

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
but hovering on land the future tech in
the<00:00:44.129> game<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:45.239> based<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.960> technology

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the game is actually based on technology

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.770 
the game is actually based on technology
that<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.370> today<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.179> we've<00:00:48.390> taken<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that we see today and we've taken it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
that we see today and we've taken it
further<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> things<00:00:50.129> about

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
further that's one of the things about

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.009 
further that's one of the things about
call<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.670> duty's<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.300> relatable<00:00:51.660> got

call of duty's got to be relatable got

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.079 
call of duty's got to be relatable got
to<00:00:52.109> be<00:00:52.199> believable<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.339> are<00:00:53.489> taking<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
to be believable but we are taking it to

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.630 
to be believable but we are taking it to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
to throw somebody further you can grab a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.999 
to throw somebody further you can grab a
card<00:01:24.610> or<00:01:24.759> pull<00:01:25.659> it<00:01:25.750> off<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> car<00:01:26.380> use<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:26.979> a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
card or pull it off a car use it as a

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.130 
card or pull it off a car use it as a
shield<00:01:27.369> another<00:01:28.360> exciting<00:01:28.600> part<00:01:28.869> about<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
shield another exciting part about the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.279 
shield another exciting part about the
exoskeleton<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.070> EXO<00:01:31.060> abilities<00:01:31.289> overdrive

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
exoskeleton is EXO abilities overdrive

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.870 
exoskeleton is EXO abilities overdrive
is<00:01:32.470> pretty<00:01:32.680> cool<00:01:32.890> because<00:01:33.250> what<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.610> does<00:01:33.640> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
is pretty cool because what it does it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.210 
is pretty cool because what it does it
makes<00:01:34.060> you<00:01:34.180> go<00:01:34.360> faster<00:01:34.929> which<00:01:35.140> looks<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
makes you go faster which looks like the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.499 
makes you go faster which looks like the
world<00:01:36.490> around<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.149> going<00:01:37.479> slower<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
world around you is going slower the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.969 
world around you is going slower the
exoskeleton<00:01:40.509> will<00:01:40.960> change<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.560> game<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:41.920> a

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
exoskeleton will change the game at a

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.469 
exoskeleton will change the game at a
bunch<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.310> ways<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.000> what<00:01:43.119> we're<00:01:43.240> trying<00:01:43.390> to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
bunch of ways but what we're trying to

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.020 
bunch of ways but what we're trying to
do<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.810> not<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.649> make<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:44.979> complicated<00:01:45.340> many

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
do is not to make it complicated many

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.059 
do is not to make it complicated many
times<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.479> mean<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:46.750> just<00:01:46.810> one<00:01:47.080> button<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:47.950> if

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
times I mean it's just one button so if

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.279 
times I mean it's just one button so if
