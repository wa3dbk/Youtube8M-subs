 girona and getafe tied 1 at the 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.129
 first leg of the sixteenth of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.410
 final of the king's cup at the stadium 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.500
 Municipal de Montilivi party very 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.900
 attractive very competed between a first 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.810
 elgeta division and a second the girona 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.190
 which actually started the game by putting 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.289
 already in trouble to the local goalkeeper or 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.780
 visitor rather jordi codina 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.140
 this is a very dangerous fault in the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.760
 front of the area that would be the only 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.070
 goal of the girona in the match the victim 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.989
 now he would execute the fault with mastery 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.150
 with left leg and placing the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.020
 ball to the left of the goal 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.090
 codina scoring david timor 1 to 0 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.829
 until practically the end of the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.350
 first part was almost half an hour with 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.720
 that advantage on the scoreboard the team 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.600
 ricardo rodríguez the two teams with 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.640
 some news in the onces but 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.329
 playing an encounter as we said is 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.390
 very competitive 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.509
 on the part of both squads he searched and 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.659
 he found almost the second the team 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.380
 Catalan with this ball hanging from the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.159
 right again by david timor 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.929
 and with 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.509
 ramallo the side that was one of the 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.759
 best in the second half of Girona 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.039
 point to contact the ball a great 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.100
 opportunity little by little it was growing in 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.840
 the encounter of the getafe and in the end it finished 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.539
 getting the prize as we said to the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.040
 edge of rest before this opportunity 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.800
 at minute 22 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.680
 of Pablo Sarabia sending the ball by 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.480
 above the crossbar 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.110
 Roberto Lake hanging a ball inside 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.600
 of the area looking for jaime gavilán and here 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.080
 the tie would come to 1 Chilean 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.880
 wonderful from cyprus and maritza the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250
 Romanian footballer who runs into 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.580
 a poor clearance by the girona goalkeeper 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 jorge palatsí 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.050
 it clears badly because in fact it leaves the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.260
 ball at mercy 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.660
 of Romanian that does accommodate the 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.870
 body and manages to execute a Chilean 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.000
 of beautiful invoice was 1 to 1 and in fact 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.460
 the marker would no longer move in this 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.320
 38th minute of the first half there was 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.150
 opportunities in the second period was 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.700
 a game of many fouls played with 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.270
 a lot of intensity started the second 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.050
 half with this very clear occasion for the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.930
 blue box bad goalkeeper's exit 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.450
 jorge palatsí and maritza takes advantage of it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.810
 for an empty door try to put the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.090
 ball between the three clubs 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.519
 excellent pass diagonals of the sen 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.530
 at the end of the ball not enter the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.060
 goal would go a little bit to the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.340
 left of the stick 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.790
 interned as we said of ramallo that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.180
 they were very dangerous and they ended up 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.940
 example in this very clear play by 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.250
 part of the Catalan Chandon picture is not 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.890
 able to beat codin after is 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.269
 interned to the area of ramallo opportunity 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.550
 very clear the clearest of all the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.640
 second period practically for the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.920
 set of the league forward followed the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.040
 very competitive match in the second 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.750
 period and now it is gerard bordás that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.720
 he went in for the second period 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.860
 the one with this great opportunity 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.319
 hunting a ball with left leg and 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.380
 with the same leg shooting at goal 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.090
 in the end draw in this first leg 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.430
 of the sixteenth finals all by 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.459
 decide on the return in the municipal 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 montilivi tables between girona and getafe 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.900
 they did 1 getafe 1
