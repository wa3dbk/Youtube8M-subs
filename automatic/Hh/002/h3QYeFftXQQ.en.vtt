would always ask permission before using
it<00:00:30.080> there<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.439> many<00:00:32.430> ways<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.510> what

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it there will be many ways to do what

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
it there will be many ways to do what
i'm<00:00:33.899> showing<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.260> today<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:35.460> sophisticated

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
i'm showing you today more sophisticated

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.889 
i'm showing you today more sophisticated
techniques<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:37.469> layer<00:00:37.710> masks<00:00:38.160> etc<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
techniques with layer masks etc but the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.139 
techniques with layer masks etc but the
reason<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.290> doing<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> way<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.800> am<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
reason I'm doing it the way I am is so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
reason I'm doing it the way I am is so
that<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.530> easiest<00:00:43.680> way

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that it would be I think the easiest way

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
that it would be I think the easiest way
to<00:00:44.219> reproduce<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.180> other<00:00:45.840> programs

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to reproduce it in other programs

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.639 
to reproduce it in other programs
outside<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:47.280> photoshop<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> i<00:00:49.020> will<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
outside of photoshop and i will for the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.150 
outside of photoshop and i will for the
most<00:00:49.710> part<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.309> using<00:00:50.989> menu<00:00:51.989> commands<00:00:52.739> versus

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
most part be using menu commands versus

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
most part be using menu commands versus
keyboard<00:00:53.579> commands<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.899> there<00:00:55.110> will

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
keyboard commands so that there will

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.049 
keyboard commands so that there will
hopefully<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.010> less<00:00:56.190> confusion

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
hopefully be a little less confusion

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.900 
hopefully be a little less confusion
about<00:00:57.510> whether<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.500> pc<00:00:59.039> versus

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
about whether or not it was a pc versus

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.680 
about whether or not it was a pc versus
a<00:00:59.940> mac<00:01:00.210> keyboard<00:01:00.690> shortcut<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:02.329> rest<00:01:03.329> assured

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a mac keyboard shortcut but rest assured

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
a mac keyboard shortcut but rest assured
I<00:01:03.960> am<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.409> eee<00:01:04.559> pc<00:01:04.860> user<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.850> i<00:01:05.880> do

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I am a little eee pc user so when i do

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
I am a little eee pc user so when i do
use<00:01:06.360> keyboard<00:01:06.810> commands<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
use keyboard commands they are that of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.440 
use keyboard commands they are that of
the<00:01:08.850> pc<00:01:09.780> flavor<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> let's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the pc flavor and that's about it let's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
the pc flavor and that's about it let's
get<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.720> today's<00:01:12.840> tutorial<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
get into today's tutorial it in this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
get into today's tutorial it in this
tutorial<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.220> use<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
tutorial we are going to use a little

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
tutorial we are going to use a little
bit<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> dodging<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> burning

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
bit of dodging a little bit of burning

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.480 
bit of dodging a little bit of burning
to<00:01:20.610> control<00:01:21.180> how<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.200> where<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.830> viewers<00:01:23.250> i

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to control how and where our viewers i

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
to control how and where our viewers i
will<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.930> looking<00:01:25.259> at<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
will go when they are looking at one of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.240 
will go when they are looking at one of
our<00:01:25.799> images<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.530> first<00:01:28.770> need

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
our images and to do that we first need

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.109 
our images and to do that we first need
to<00:01:29.280> understand<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> eye<00:01:31.020> works<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> very

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to understand how the eye works the very

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
to understand how the eye works the very
first<00:01:36.390> thing<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> i<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.159> go

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
first thing that i will do is it will go

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.190 
first thing that i will do is it will go
from<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.119> area<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> light<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.979> dark<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
from an area of light to dark then it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.149 
from an area of light to dark then it
moves<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.649> high<00:01:43.920> low<00:01:44.159> too<00:01:44.610> low<00:01:44.640> contrast

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
moves from high low too low contrast

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.960 
moves from high low too low contrast
then<00:01:47.159> high<00:01:47.610> sharpness<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.630> low<00:01:48.840> sharpness<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
then high sharpness to low sharpness and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
then high sharpness to low sharpness and
wraps<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.509> areas<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> focus<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.189> areas<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
wraps up with areas in focus to areas of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.260 
wraps up with areas in focus to areas of
blur<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> understanding<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.579> things<00:01:57.000> i

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
blur so understanding these things i

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
blur so understanding these things i
want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> show<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.229> image<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.619> we're

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.240 
on that and what I would normally do is
I<00:06:06.159> would<00:06:06.780> save<00:06:07.780> this<00:06:07.960> as<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.139> PSD<00:06:08.530> with<00:06:09.099> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
I would save this as a PSD with the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.740 
I would save this as a PSD with the
three<00:06:09.490> different<00:06:09.610> layers<00:06:09.969> so<00:06:10.210> if<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.479> wanted<00:06:10.690> to

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
three different layers so if I wanted to

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.570 
three different layers so if I wanted to
come<00:06:10.900> back<00:06:11.050> in<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.469> make<00:06:11.979> changes<00:06:12.280> or

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
come back in and make changes or

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.820 
come back in and make changes or
adjustments<00:06:12.699> I<00:06:13.270> could<00:06:13.570> and<00:06:13.780> then<00:06:13.810> flatten<00:06:14.740> it

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
adjustments I could and then flatten it

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.709 
adjustments I could and then flatten it
and<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:15.190> would<00:06:15.340> print<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:15.849> that's<00:06:16.360> pretty

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
and I would print it and that's pretty

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.200
