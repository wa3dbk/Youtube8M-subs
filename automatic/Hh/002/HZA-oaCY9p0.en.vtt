 a mouse for gaming 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.990
 model 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:39.040
 300 hours and focus with my cell phone 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.930
 I have a camera brand giÃ±os that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.290
 go through 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.950
 with some very good velcros 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:53.470
 and it's this good they can buy them 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.470
 considerable size 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.170
 again 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.170
 I do not need it 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.490
 has different shades of color is 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 multicolor has a few extra buttons 6-3 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.030
 they could see 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.560
 good goes up to 2000 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.560
 good this 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.550
 I'm going to good I'll spend a second the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.759
 video and I'm going for something to open the box 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.480
 now come 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.560
 story tells that that day 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.560
 open the box 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.860
 I want 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.020
 for crespo weather 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.020
 two 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.140
 difficult here the boxes 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.920
 once there was one that knows the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.590
 magnificent is quite difficult 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.150
 do not 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.150
 here is what everyone expected 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.150
 and then a facebook with the reverse stake 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.319
 these 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.319
 we go 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.739
 insurance 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.820
 and they seem to believe 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 then blur color matte or 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.500
 It does not have a shine on it 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.120
 is that it is enough 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.120
 as proud 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:10.590
 they do not have sliding templates 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.590
 you will see this is turned off 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.220
 this is the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.640
 that we all pass usb cable 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.240
 and most of most articles 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.860
 gaming for gaming bring 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.470
 I think it 's tomorrow in gold or something 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.470
 but very few practically nothing 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.570
 the cable I do not know what size it said 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.570
 but it must be considerably large 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 good we have this 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:04.670
 this came with the typical user manual 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.090
 and well this is the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.900
 is that I follow the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.760
 genius x 300 has an approximate cost 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.760
 It cost me good 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.479
 420 pesos that are around 35 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.130
 dollars so that's cheap is good 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.750
 pretty and cheap 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.460
 and good apart from this I bought also 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.630
 something that I do not think that interests them much 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.300
 good 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:40.129
 this is the mouse pad that I used 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:43.339
 that is practically nothing 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.379
 already has too much use was time to 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.110
 buy another I did not buy a gaming 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.569
 because it did not reach me anymore so 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.249
 I bought a good generic one this is more 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:58.910
 great than the other and I already needed one 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:01.289
 all this has been boxing 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.369
 x that 300 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.369
 and if you focus 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.500
 good 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.570
 do not forget that a like always 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.570
 thank you and goodbye
