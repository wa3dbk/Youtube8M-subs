hey guys what's going on this is Jay
from<00:00:12.290> Sony<00:00:12.530> Alpha<00:00:12.769> lab<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:13.370> in<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:14.150> little

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
from Sony Alpha lab and in this little

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.540 
from Sony Alpha lab and in this little
video<00:00:14.959> here<00:00:15.110> I'm<00:00:15.500> just<00:00:15.650> gonna<00:00:15.769> go<00:00:15.950> over<00:00:15.980> the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
video here I'm just gonna go over the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.080 
video here I'm just gonna go over the
conversion<00:00:17.330> lenses<00:00:17.840> for<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.430> 16<00:00:19.849> millimeter

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
conversion lenses for the 16 millimeter

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.630 
conversion lenses for the 16 millimeter
wide<00:00:20.570> angle<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:21.230> there's<00:00:22.189> two<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.520> them

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
wide angle and there's two of them

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.580 
wide angle and there's two of them
there's<00:00:22.849> the<00:00:22.970> fisheye<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.599> then<00:00:23.900> there's<00:00:24.110> the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
there's the fisheye and then there's the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.940 
there's the fisheye and then there's the
actual<00:00:24.770> wide<00:00:25.250> angle<00:00:26.050> conversion<00:00:27.050> lens<00:00:27.200> this

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
actual wide angle conversion lens this

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.979 
actual wide angle conversion lens this
is<00:00:28.009> the<00:00:28.220> actual<00:00:28.520> wide-angle<00:00:29.180> one<00:00:29.329> and<00:00:29.570> it

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
is the actual wide-angle one and it

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.109 
is the actual wide-angle one and it
comes<00:00:30.169> in<00:00:30.320> these<00:00:30.410> cool<00:00:30.710> little<00:00:30.739> I<00:00:31.279> like<00:00:32.029> to

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.750 
comes in these cool little I like to
call<00:00:32.239> hamburger<00:00:32.750> bun<00:00:33.430> cases<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:34.640> are

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
call hamburger bun cases that are

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840 
call hamburger bun cases that are
hardened<00:00:35.180> which<00:00:35.450> is<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:35.809> nice<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.820> what<00:00:37.820> I

into the living room area so I'm just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.170 
into the living room area so I'm just
gonna<00:00:45.830> while<00:00:46.220> it's<00:00:46.370> recording<00:00:46.490> I'm<00:00:47.030> just

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
gonna while it's recording I'm just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.610 
gonna while it's recording I'm just
going<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.360> put<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.630> wide<00:00:47.780> angle<00:00:47.960> on<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.530> I'm

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
going to put the wide angle on that I'm

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.350 
going to put the wide angle on that I'm
gonna<00:00:48.710> put<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.010> fisheye<00:00:49.310> on<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.210> can

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
gonna put the fisheye on so you can

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.640 
gonna put the fisheye on so you can
actually<00:00:50.480> see<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.050> difference<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.560> know

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
actually see the difference you know

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.220 
actually see the difference you know
while<00:00:51.860> it's<00:00:52.010> recording<00:00:52.300> it's<00:00:53.300> also<00:00:53.450> at<00:00:53.780> f28

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
while it's recording it's also at f28

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.810 
while it's recording it's also at f28
just<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.010> know<00:00:55.190> that's<00:00:55.340> how<00:00:55.489> I<00:00:55.520> have<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
just so you know that's how I have the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.270 
just so you know that's how I have the
aperture<00:00:56.210> set<00:00:56.450> just<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.890> know<00:00:57.920> get<00:00:58.130> the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
aperture set just to you know get the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.400 
aperture set just to you know get the
shutter<00:00:58.489> speed<00:00:58.610> up<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.150> have<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.720> ISO<00:01:00.170> down

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
shutter speed up and have the ISO down

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.560 
shutter speed up and have the ISO down
so<00:01:00.649> it's<00:01:00.770> not<00:01:00.860> too<00:01:01.010> noisy<00:01:01.040> so<00:01:01.880> that's<00:01:02.360> pretty

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
so it's not too noisy so that's pretty

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.210 
so it's not too noisy so that's pretty
much<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:02.899> let<00:01:03.020> me<00:01:03.110> show<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.380> what<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.070> looks
