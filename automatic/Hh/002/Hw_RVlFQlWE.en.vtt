00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.910 
but basically when you put your device
on<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:42.119> does<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.680> little

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
on there what does is it all the little

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.710 
on there what does is it all the little
suction<00:01:44.130> cups<00:01:44.490> grab<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.970> Twitter<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
suction cups grab on Twitter so it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
suction cups grab on Twitter so it
doesn't<00:01:45.960> move<00:01:46.110> aware<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> cool<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
doesn't move aware but the cool thing is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
doesn't move aware but the cool thing is
it's<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.119> sticky<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> doesn't<00:01:48.899> leave<00:01:48.990> any

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
it's not sticky it doesn't leave any

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's not sticky it doesn't leave any
kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> residue<00:01:50.030> that's<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> whole<00:01:51.270> idea<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
kind of residue that's the whole idea of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.359 
kind of residue that's the whole idea of
this<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.560> another<00:01:52.740> suction<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this now it's got another suction on the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.190 
this now it's got another suction on the
bottom<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.670> well<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.659> you've<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.930> desk

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
bottom as well so if you've got a desk

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
bottom as well so if you've got a desk
he<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> stick<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:55.860> desk<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.549> move

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
he can stick out your desk or what move

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
he can stick out your desk or what move
around<00:01:57.320> I'm<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.530> try<00:01:58.680> anything<00:01:58.770> Mike

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
around I'm going to try anything Mike

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
around I'm going to try anything Mike
have<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.520> tried<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.909> yet<00:02:00.469> I'm<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> see

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
have not tried that yet I'm going to see

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
have not tried that yet I'm going to see
Miss<00:02:01.920> exactly<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.399> same<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.759> stuff<00:02:02.939> here

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
Miss exactly the same as this stuff here

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
Miss exactly the same as this stuff here
i'm<00:02:04.140> thinking<00:02:04.409> i<00:02:04.469> might<00:02:04.500> even<00:02:04.619> trace<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.130> my

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
i'm thinking i might even trace in my

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
i'm thinking i might even trace in my
car<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:06.270> i've<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> nice<00:02:07.049> flat

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
car because i've got like a nice flat

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
car because i've got like a nice flat
surface<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.039> car<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.390> kind<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
surface in my car and it's not kind of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.839 
surface in my car and it's not kind of
rubble<00:02:10.259> ER<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> should<00:02:11.220> hopefully<00:02:11.489> work

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
rubble ER so you should hopefully work

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.850 
rubble ER so you should hopefully work
anyway<00:02:12.720> let's<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:12.989> show<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.319> works

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
anyway let's just show it works

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
anyway let's just show it works
so<00:02:14.400> obviously<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.910> actually<00:02:15.420> nice

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so obviously you got you actually nice

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
so obviously you got you actually nice
down<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.440> how<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.830> best<00:02:17.070> its<00:02:17.250> put

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
down there so how you do is best its put

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.930 
down there so how you do is best its put
your<00:02:17.490> device<00:02:17.670> onto<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> sticks<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:20.490> as

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
your device onto it and it sticks so as

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.370 
your device onto it and it sticks so as
you'll<00:02:21.090> probably<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.990> now<00:02:22.110> stuck

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you'll probably see that it's now stuck

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.410 
you'll probably see that it's now stuck
to<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.650> take<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.520> off<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.850> pronoun<00:02:24.120> kind<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
to it take it off just pronoun kind of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.720 
to it take it off just pronoun kind of
prize<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.780> away<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> goes<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.580> once

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
prize it away in a way it goes so once

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.800 
prize it away in a way it goes so once
again<00:02:26.820> will<00:02:27.000> show<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:27.390> would<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
again will show you now would you go a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.340 
again will show you now would you go a
bit<00:02:27.930> slower<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:29.250> I'll<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.730> pop<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.690> in

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
bit slower but I'll just pop it on in

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.800 
bit slower but I'll just pop it on in
this<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> sticks<00:02:33.390> straight

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
this down there and it sticks straight

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.380 
this down there and it sticks straight
to<00:02:34.080> where<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.490> beef<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.060> mean

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
to where and it's in that beef I mean

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.340 
to where and it's in that beef I mean
gonna<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.660> impressed<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> don't<00:02:37.260> know

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
gonna be impressed with the don't know

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.990 
gonna be impressed with the don't know
you<00:02:37.530> know<00:02:37.560> exactly<00:02:37.800> who<00:02:38.070> mid<00:02:38.310> technology<00:02:38.880> and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you know exactly who mid technology and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.060 
you know exactly who mid technology and
how<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.120> exactly<00:02:39.540> works<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
how it exactly works but it is

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.310 
how it exactly works but it is
impressive<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.940> I'd<00:02:42.150> say<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> least<00:02:42.570> it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
impressive and I'd say the least it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
impressive and I'd say the least it
means<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> sure<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.830> not<00:02:43.950> actually<00:02:44.160> no<00:02:44.220> it's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
means to sure it's not actually no it's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890 
means to sure it's not actually no it's
not<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.550> stuck<00:02:44.850> there<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.690> not

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
not just stuck there just you know not

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
not just stuck there just you know not
just<00:02:46.560> tacked<00:02:46.860> there<00:02:47.270> he's<00:02:48.270> actually<00:02:48.450> there's

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
just tacked there he's actually there's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.000 
just tacked there he's actually there's
you've<00:02:48.930> probably<00:02:49.110> heard<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.590> part<00:02:49.830> there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you've probably heard on that part there

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
you've probably heard on that part there
so<00:02:50.700> again<00:02:50.880> all<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.240> does<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.570> basically<00:02:51.780> it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so again all it does is you basically it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.560 
so again all it does is you basically it
attaches<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.550> smooth<00:02:53.850> part<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.270> device

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
attaches to this smooth part of a device

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.070 
attaches to this smooth part of a device
and<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.800> there<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.310> you'll<00:02:56.580> see<00:02:57.080> in

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and then it's on there as you'll see in

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.670 
and then it's on there as you'll see in
coming<00:02:58.470> off<00:02:58.850> no<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:01.320> canuck<00:03:01.530> it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
coming off no you know I'm canuck it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.530 
coming off no you know I'm canuck it
around<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.850> coming<00:03:03.060> off<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.360> anytime

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
around it's not coming off there anytime

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.330 
around it's not coming off there anytime
soon<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.770> obviously<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
soon it's obviously you can have that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.640 
soon it's obviously you can have that
for<00:03:05.610> watching<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> movie<00:03:06.480> are<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.590> to

for watching a movie are you know to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.199 
for watching a movie are you know to
want<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.890> stick<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.190> Nikki<00:03:08.340> computer<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.120> you

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
want to stick it Nikki computer when you
