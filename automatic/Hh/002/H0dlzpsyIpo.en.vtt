00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.769
 hi everyone today before 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.259
 that winter is coming to an end I'm going to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.630
 present a winter decor that I have 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 realized in watercolor therefore it down 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.740
 I first put a nail polish very very 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 clear and I also want to use a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 last m glitter cosmetics 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 so I'm going to use a gradient I put 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.519
 some glitter on my brush and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 I will come and put them on what 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.450
 I call me the water of the nail so close 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 cuticles and then I'll come 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 and shoot and glitter that I filed 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.899
 to come the gradients a little bit 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 so to do that it is not necessary that he 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.469
 there is too much payet on your brush 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.539
 if there are too many you go blinds 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.379
 and a little bit on the on the flask 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.360
 quite simply 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879
 and so we do not put glitter in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 bottom of the ngos for the video I decided 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.270
 to test a top coat match but you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 can also think very lightly 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.320
 your varnish so against it must 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.750
 absolutely a care to put your top coat 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 matt be pointed at the varnish be 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 masters of acrylic painting but 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 the watercolor does not hang on a sure 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 lacquered varnish so that's why me 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 here I put a mac top coat that works 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 not so with all the top coat maths 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.619
 so you have to test once your 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 top coat and dry I spend a little bit 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.250
 of alcohol to remove dust and that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.100
 it's a bit better and so I 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 am going to use my watercolor painting and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 my detail brush usually 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.720
 brush or bluff 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.630
 so I will first take a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 fairly liquid watercolor paint enough 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.020
 transparent so I do not put it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.049
 badly water and not a lot of pigments 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.880
 so with this pretty watercolor painting 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.860
 transparent I will come to do the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.860
 stalactites 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.649
 so I start you see a bone of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.030
 the nail and I do little pics we go 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.340
 to say they go down from 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.450
 the fingernail I also do in places 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.939
 small form of drops 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.009
 so I advise you to go see everything 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.840
 simply photos on google of good 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.640
 look at how are trained and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.170
 stalactites how does it look less like 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.689
 every time I do not invent anything I look 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.490
 photos before and so does 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.049
 to use this transparent paint 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.140
 will allow us to see the glitter 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.890
 through then I'll keep the same 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.790
 watercolor painting but I want 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.069
 add some pigments 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.319
 extra in my mix for 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.090
 have a watercolor more so go for it 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.740
 with this watercolor a little bit more 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.150
 dark a little bit more pigmented I 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.670
 will come to shadows on the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.800
 stalactites so for that I add 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 always on the same side a little bit of 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.370
 painting over what I already have 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.890
 drawn so that allow us to have 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.270
 something a bit more a relief 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.010
 we will say then I always keep the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.110
 same painting and this time on the other hand 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.330
 I will learn it well spice up 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.950
 the strongest is possible in fact so 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 I put very little water I just put this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.160
 that it takes water and I put a lot 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.530
 of many colors a lot of 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.940
 painting in it so I'm going 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.010
 to have something very dark 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.380
 come off contours so you see 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.690
 I pass by all around food 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.310
 stalactites and you see I have 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.310
 therefore used only one color 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.080
 from watercolor to game I'm just working on 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.630
 the dosage 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.459
 then I use the white crisis and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.890
 so with the acrylic paint I'm going 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.680
 come make small stars so the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 stars it's just small 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.910
 cross over who will cross each other and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.430
 so I'm doing a bigger enough and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.280
 after one more a little bit smaller 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.989
 so both crosses cross each other 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.540
 its shape a little stars that 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.680
 twinkle must try to make 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 traits to his ends also it's better and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.920
 so then to finish you have to ask 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.450
 the top coat is a step he does not 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280
 do not zap because it will do 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.200
 bring out the glitter and then especially 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.000
 it will make your painting stand out 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.060
 watercolor otherwise it will go directly 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.820
 aloi me for the top coat I like 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.650
 well put first a layer of a 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.600
 clear liquid varnish that goes 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.489
 easily in every nook and cranny like 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.680
 that I'm sure I'll go everywhere and that 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 my watercolors will hold and then I 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.519
 put a second layer of the top coat of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.079
 favorite quads motorbikes so here 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.690
 I hope it does not look like you 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.670
 rain I make you kisses
