00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.249
 as long as the stream of ice flows, these waves do not break 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.970
 Cracks and turns in the winter the river has a temperature of 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.380
 only two degrees Celsius 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.170
 In this case, this is a special fun and in the middle of Munich 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.119
 on the southern edge of the English garden 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.289
 Eisbach was there with the power of a man-high waves under the bridge 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.190
 emerges 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.920
 already allowed at the end 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.360
 so it is in the city can do what you here 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.560
 Today we will decide everything ourselves but not the whole thing 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.300
 take seriously 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.330
 or even the longed-for "yes" word Sulzer or move down 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.330
 the latter were also confirmed 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.700
 The surfers are just that for the photographer Dieter Deventer 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.699
 right motive 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.359
 he himself is passionately documented with water full for 38 years 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.359
 he's the tricks of the PlusServer scene in Munich 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 when photographing for his intuition 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.750
 He pays attention to every detail 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.650
 he was full of life 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 Moment I see 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 his market value has his eyes in front of the give 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.750
 three points are missing 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.230
 and sometimes the world is led 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.230
 the leader said ready 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.210
 With his pictures Dieter Deventer wants the little-known extreme sport 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.009
 Give face 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.289
 Over the past five years, thousands of photos have emerged the best 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.289
 he has chosen more economically for his illustrated book 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.700
 the world's first large photo documentation about the monastery 5 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.570
 photography is a change for the Munich as his work 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 the Briton 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.270
 Photo above hangs you can start to go 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.870
 to explore the world 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.670
 can not discover topics the percent one can not like trying 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.930
 old pictures very difficult to find 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.759
 to take pictures 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.459
 that's a hobby 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.149
 as well as creating the plus 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.199
 one of the birthplaces of this sport is Munich at the beginning of the seventies 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.699
 in which Dieter Deventer and his sports friends Brechtel riders stand 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.419
 Light like water skiing, they stand with wooden boards on the river the ropes 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.459
 are tied to bridge piers 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.319
 but all of a sudden the balls carry the boards up without being around it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.779
 knew what happened here when the glass was suddenly gone 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.739
 Report to the authorities harder at a start under water or something 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.919
 and then we started with air mattresses and first built surfboards or 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
 but left the rope at home and then it started already 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:57.089
 his experiences inspired the director and cinematographer in 1980 to his 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:00.559
 semi-documentary feature film «The World» 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.129
 The story of the little boy of the whole East would be able to say place 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.049
 can afford 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.059
 work that around 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:11.799
 Paper as a newspaper publisher and experienced so many adventures on the target 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.549
 To learn surfing 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.769
 that was a little bit 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.150
 my story also changed mm in his illustrated book are also photos of others 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.259
 Photographers of surfers North Rivers in Canada 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.139
 the Amazon area next to France in the 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:37.209
 the inhabitants can be seen in the UK Euro it is the same in Worcester 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.679
 Tides Klose wants in England 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:46.249
 photographed by striking now talking apart motorized kites 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.449
 insane photo s 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.019
 Percent I got to know relatively late percent 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.019
 but the book almost finished reason is a real asset 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.719
 at Munich's Eisbach you meet almost every day members of the Bavarian 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.579
 Dairy farming as tenth 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.579
 and often on her photographer 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.639
 again and again after three weeks a cool photo has managed 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.199
 that things are not going so well yet 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.189
 and if still driving percent too 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.259
 yes, that one can talk of luck but not as happy as it went 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.080
 himself Fr 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.979
 the winter over annoying the countries that run but dear to his friends 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.979
 and is dedicated to his second passion 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.330
 taking photos
