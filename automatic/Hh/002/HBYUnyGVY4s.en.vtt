00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello dear friends in this video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 I want to tell you about Splitpush 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.280
 split push was very popular 2013 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 mainly because of the style of play alliance what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 same split-push 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 and why it is used we all know what 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 is push line 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.609
 but split push is a bit different when 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.699
 we split-push them we push no line 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 and several at the same time that is when 4 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.099
 heroes go one lane one hero 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 most mobile push another line this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.120
 makes enemies constantly 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.790
 stretch and move around the map 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 when enemies are clamped at the base itâ€™s easier 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 david one side but when instead of one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 pushing 2 or 3 then the enemy becomes 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.739
 several times harder 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.199
 defef and somehow fight it happens that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.219
 split push use then when you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 clamped on base 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.530
 and somehow you need to pull the time out 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 the necessary artifacts and make sure that you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.859
 did not break the barracks 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 and now I will tell you by example how 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 it happens when you're in four 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.299
 stand on base one of your ally is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 in a different way lane and pushes him reaching 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.430
 barracks in the body remains two options 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.470
 either fight you by going on the ramp or 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.259
 do teleport to zadefat bass 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.720
 If the enemies remain and will be 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.110
 go to the highground then the hero who split 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.360
 push 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.530
 breaks the barracks easily and the four of you 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 for a very long time you can go away from your enemies 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 if the enemies have decided to make 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.490
 Teleport to the base in this case the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.869
 who is pushing quickly to do a report home a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.619
 you already cling 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.630
 don't let the remaining enemies go 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.540
 splitpushit in dota is pretty simple legs 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 those who play dota don't know how to play 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 against him therefore they need 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 always use now I'll tell 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.530
 you basic requirements in order to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.719
 split push was effective the very first 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.770
 These are mobile heroes who can 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.679
 move and break buildings 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.469
 the second one of the main ones is the wards and 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.590
 map review for successful split push 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.310
 it is always necessary to see the enemy and move away 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.720
 if it fits third with splitpush 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.629
 you need to make as few mistakes as possible 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.110
 and follow the movement of enemies to 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.810
 not die 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 otherwise, all efforts will go down the drain 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 one of the most effective heroes 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.299
 Pushing together are such heroes as 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.060
 Fahrion Antimag Amber Spirit Broodmother 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.720
 while you're a queen of pain trader 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 a couple of others 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.470
 on this note the basics of split push fit 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.380
 by the end I really hope the video was 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.150

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.750
