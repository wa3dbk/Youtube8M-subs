00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.180
 and I think on my channel I do 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.460
 several videos for for help by 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 relation to destiny game or for now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 on this game after maybe on several 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 two other games so here is so if you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 want if you have one of two hours 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 face another video to explain a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 stuff you do not have to do or that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.250
 you understand not leave a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 comment 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 so this first video will consist of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.420
 show you where a spectrum of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.200
 purposes in relation to an exotic quest 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:53.940
 so it was this exotic quest 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 it's called I lost no to these 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 standards the fragment of memory dimmed and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 be wrong so here is so at the end 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.769
 of a hundred completed contract that this 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.659
 either evidence contracts like 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.380
 this one where the other written contracts 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.939
 or purple and ben the guy who gives you 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
 contracts offer you between three 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.409
 contracts so that's me so I took 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.759

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 ten fusion rifles so this quest 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.580
 it is precisely for refusing the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 exotic fusion 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.509
 do with this quest these two he's going 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.479
