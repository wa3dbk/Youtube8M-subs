lack of front protection beyond
obviously<00:03:18.900> trying<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.199> make<00:03:19.349> this<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.620> thin<00:03:19.859> as

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
obviously trying to make this as thin as

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.009 
obviously trying to make this as thin as
possible<00:03:20.489> given<00:03:20.729> how<00:03:20.819> thick<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.239> back<00:03:21.419> is<00:03:21.659> but

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
possible given how thick the back is but

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.539

there's barely any lip at all here I

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.339 
there's barely any lip at all here I
would<00:03:24.209> highly<00:03:24.479> recommend<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.930> pair<00:03:25.199> this
