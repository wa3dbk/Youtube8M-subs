00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.290
 for this life choice let's see the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.630
 song goodbye album a lot of rammstein 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.480
 tuning and drop all the chords of the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.130
 so they are done in the chords of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.990
 power of the rope thus are made in 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.690
 the same frets is worth it so let's go 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.740
 start with the frets 8 of the strings 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.740
 6 5 4 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.750
 we lower a power chord this time 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.380
 on the rope 5 for what we already used 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.380
 the fingers 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.590
 I have seen 10 8 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.460
 5 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 3 a car table according to 5 vale 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 we repeat again 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.770
 8 a 18 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.090
 and now what we are going to do is playing 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.280
 with the octaves pass all these 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 power chords at 45 we're going to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 climb the rope if we can 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.869
 say if we do everything in it 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 rope and the only thing we have to do 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.680
 is to raise and lower your finger 1 is worth it 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.680
 for the most novice 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.640
 of 8 15 17 15 12 and the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.210
 ropes 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210
 and 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.020
 today I am let's start again 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.140
 another option is the correct one you see that 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.610
 they sound differently different a dragon assured 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.530
 that you can know the original sound 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 that way we will move to the next 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 net 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 after 38 of the rope if he remembers 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
 power fret 8 of the agreement to 5 chord 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.680
 of power 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.680
 fret 55 remembered power 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.930
 good 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.930
 OK 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.850
 how do you see those Xs then nothing 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.550
 simply 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.160
 to user 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.920
 off the ropes to the king leo you can if 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.440
 they look for a sharper sound throughout 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.100
 the strings I fixed to cover the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.100
 everything you can 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.370
 already with the presentation fret 3 of the string 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.370
 5 slide to 5 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.320
 and this is worth very sencillito like 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.120
 in the previous case we can pass the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.750
 chords of power of the rope 5 of 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.750
 strings 6 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.360
 8 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.360
 15 12 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 it's exactly the same and this is the only thing 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.870
 what we do to give that 5 birth a little 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 worth and much support from the base of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.600
 percussion and synthesizer and so on 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.110
 etcetera but we the only thing 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.110
 we do is he 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.620
 the rest of the game 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.560
 there would only be one part that is the ground 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.560
 which is very simple 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.090
 we're not going to do now that does not seem 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.100
 well I'm going to rehearse it before it's going to come out 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.100
 best 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.880
 well, you always have to practice a little 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.750
 but as you have seen very simple 810 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.750
 of the guards 2 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.550
 on rope 210 of rope 37 of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.550
 the rope 3 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.320
 and looking for the point in the alternate 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.360
 go to the world better 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.180
 good the case of the east has been the subject 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.560
 goodbye to wolfenstein from his women album 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.750
 but we have served you 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.400
 liked and nothing do not stop sharing and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.400
 enjoy the world
