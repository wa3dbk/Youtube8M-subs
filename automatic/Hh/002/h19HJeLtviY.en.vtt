omelette<00:00:05.120> first<00:00:06.120> off<00:00:06.359> you're<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.870> start

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
omelette first off you're going to start

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.129 
omelette first off you're going to start
by<00:00:07.259> slicing<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.770> large<00:00:08.189> eggplant<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.000> prefer<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
by slicing a large eggplant I prefer the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.110 
by slicing a large eggplant I prefer the
large<00:00:10.380> eggplant<00:00:10.889> because<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.759> little<00:00:12.000> bit

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
large eggplant because it's a little bit

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.749 
large eggplant because it's a little bit
firmer<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.719> meat<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.290> also<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.280> makes<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
firmer in meat and also it makes for a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980 
firmer in meat and also it makes for a
better<00:00:14.880> omelet

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.019 

as<00:00:20.050> you<00:00:20.680> can<00:00:20.800> see<00:00:21.039> I'm<00:00:21.279> slicing<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.940> into

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
as you can see I'm slicing it into

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.880 
as you can see I'm slicing it into
different<00:00:22.779> thicknesses<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.800> is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
different thicknesses and this is

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.290 
different thicknesses and this is
because<00:00:24.160> my<00:00:24.340> husband<00:00:24.700> prefers<00:00:25.000> thinner

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
because my husband prefers thinner

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.019 
because my husband prefers thinner
slices<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.990> I<00:00:26.500> prefer<00:00:26.710> thicker<00:00:27.039> slices<00:00:27.220> so

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
slices and I prefer thicker slices so

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.950 
slices and I prefer thicker slices so
you<00:00:28.090> can<00:00:28.300> do<00:00:28.419> whichever<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.960> prefer<00:00:30.960> after

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
you can do whichever you prefer after

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.479 
you can do whichever you prefer after

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
want to salt both sides and you're going

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.580 
want to salt both sides and you're going
to<00:00:36.100> want<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.370> salt<00:00:36.580> it<00:00:36.699> liberally<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:38.230> doesn't

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
to want to salt it liberally it doesn't

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.960 
to want to salt it liberally it doesn't
matter<00:00:38.739> how<00:00:38.920> much<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.220> put<00:00:39.400> on<00:00:39.580> because

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
matter how much you put on because

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.850 
matter how much you put on because
you'll<00:00:40.180> be<00:00:40.210> rinsing<00:00:40.629> it<00:00:40.750> off<00:00:40.840> later<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.680> don't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
you'll be rinsing it off later so don't

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.410 
you'll be rinsing it off later so don't
worry<00:00:41.920> about<00:00:42.280> high<00:00:42.460> sodium<00:00:42.699> issues<00:00:43.239> I<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:46.390> to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.479 
worry about high sodium issues I like to
stack<00:00:46.780> them<00:00:46.989> up<00:00:47.110> on<00:00:47.290> each<00:00:47.440> other<00:00:47.680> after<00:00:48.160> I<00:00:48.220> coat

stack them up on each other after I coat
both<00:00:48.699> sides<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:49.420> just<00:00:49.870> helps<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.230> save<00:00:50.379> space

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.600 
be too salty after the rinsing is
complete<00:02:38.780> you'll<00:02:39.440> simply<00:02:39.680> pat<00:02:40.040> dry<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.400> a

complete you'll simply pat dry with a
paper<00:02:40.670> towel

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.130

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
you don't have to Pat them completely

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.080 
you don't have to Pat them completely
try<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.610> just<00:02:48.820> remove<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.330> excess<00:02:49.750> water

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
try but just remove the excess water

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.520 
try but just remove the excess water
that<00:02:52.090> way<00:02:52.270> you'll<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.630> less<00:02:52.870> splatters<00:02:53.290> when

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
that way you'll get less splatters when
