00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
the easiest in the world but it's

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.969 
the easiest in the world but it's
something<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.629> have<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.809> do<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.800> one<00:05:01.919> of

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
something you have to do that is one of

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.249 
something you have to do that is one of
the<00:05:02.069> reasons<00:05:02.309> why<00:05:02.399> I<00:05:02.430> was<00:05:03.119> asked<00:05:03.599> to<00:05:03.779> join<00:05:03.899> team

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
the reasons why I was asked to join team

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.290 
the reasons why I was asked to join team
calibers<00:05:04.710> because<00:05:05.009> I<00:05:05.249> did<00:05:05.969> the<00:05:06.029> recruitment

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
calibers because I did the recruitment

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.029 
calibers because I did the recruitment
challenge<00:05:06.479> video<00:05:06.869> i<00:05:07.050> uploaded<00:05:07.259> in<00:05:07.649> two<00:05:07.860> days

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
so that's one of the reasons and the

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.859 
so that's one of the reasons and the
second<00:05:10.559> reason<00:05:10.589> was<00:05:10.849> they<00:05:11.849> saw<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.539> I<00:05:12.719> had
