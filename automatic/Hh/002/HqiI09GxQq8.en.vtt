00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and a whole but not too bad and there's
and<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.770> closer

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and this one there's a little closer

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.320 
and this one there's a little closer
together<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.430> not<00:02:32.460> much<00:02:32.640> stretching<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
together it's not much stretching in it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.780 
together it's not much stretching in it
so<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> little<00:02:33.630> easier<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.050> play<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so it's a little easier to play and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.740 
so it's a little easier to play and
those<00:02:39.240> sound<00:02:39.510> good

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
those sound good

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840 
those sound good
I<00:02:40.140> tend<00:02:40.590> not<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.860> play<00:02:41.220> them<00:02:41.400> too<00:02:41.490> straight<00:02:41.760> up

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
I tend not to play them too straight up

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.270 
I tend not to play them too straight up
and<00:02:42.000> down<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.150> try<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.480> do<00:02:42.660> some<00:02:42.930> sort<00:02:43.170> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
and down I try to do some sort of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
and down I try to do some sort of
improvised<00:02:44.280> pattern<00:02:44.850> inside<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.420> like

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.390 

there<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.080> can<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.379> feel<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.680> snake<00:03:09.190> being

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
there you can just feel that snake being

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.759 
there you can just feel that snake being
charmed<00:03:10.170> another<00:03:11.170> look<00:03:11.440> I'll<00:03:11.560> give<00:03:11.739> you

a<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.590> bit's<00:03:47.799> fret<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:48.579> just<00:03:48.730> gonna

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
a little bit's fret and I'm just gonna

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.520 
a little bit's fret and I'm just gonna
play<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.510> is<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.019> important<00:03:50.379> this<00:03:50.470> is

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
play this is this is important this is

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.259 
play this is this is important this is
the<00:03:50.620> picking<00:03:51.040> pattern<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.730> makes<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.030> work

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
the picking pattern that makes this work

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.890 
the picking pattern that makes this work
it's<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.599> off<00:03:52.780> stroke<00:03:53.109> a<00:03:53.349> down<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:55.420> pull-offs

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
it's it off stroke a down to pull-offs

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.660 
it's it off stroke a down to pull-offs
and<00:03:57.780> another<00:03:58.780> down<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.859> just<00:03:59.950> cycle<00:04:00.579> it

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
and another down and I just cycle it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.039 
and another down and I just cycle it
over<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.060> over<00:04:01.239> without<00:04:01.359> stopping<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.019> the

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
over and over without stopping in the

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:14.950 
over and over without stopping in the
middle<00:04:02.109> so

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.320 

I<00:04:15.960> love<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.890> sound<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> fast

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
I love the sound of that with a fast

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.190 
I love the sound of that with a fast
lick<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:18.780> that

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
lick like that

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.229 
lick like that
crystal<00:04:19.769> 5<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> weird<00:04:20.700> number<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.150> don't

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
crystal 5 is a weird number you don't

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.020 
crystal 5 is a weird number you don't
often<00:04:21.480> hear<00:04:21.630> 5's<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.800> rock<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.250> roll<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:23.940> if

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
often hear 5's and rock and roll but if

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.610 
often hear 5's and rock and roll but if
you<00:04:24.150> play<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.510> fast<00:04:24.720> enough<00:04:24.840> you'll<00:04:25.050> begin<00:04:25.560> to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
you play it fast enough you'll begin to

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.980 
you play it fast enough you'll begin to
hear<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.860> pulse<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.640> let's<00:04:27.480> listen<00:04:27.780> listen

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
hear a pulse like let's listen listen

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:36.410 
hear a pulse like let's listen listen
foilage<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:34.110> at<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.350> tempo<00:04:35.090> it's<00:04:36.090> gonna<00:04:36.240> be

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
foilage so at that tempo it's gonna be

00:04:36.420 --> 00:05:23.050 
foilage so at that tempo it's gonna be
ok<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:37.020> play<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.200> song<00:04:37.640> that

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.300 

you<00:05:24.060> have<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.420> do<00:05:24.540> some<00:05:24.720> Doug<00:05:24.960> Henning<00:05:25.350> hand

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
you have to do some Doug Henning hand

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.710 
you have to do some Doug Henning hand
magical<00:05:26.880> movements<00:05:27.270> when<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:27.450> do<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:27.660> kind

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
magical movements when you do that kind

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.270 
magical movements when you do that kind
of<00:05:27.900> playing<00:05:28.140> actually<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.830> don't<00:05:28.980> have<00:05:29.160> to

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
of playing actually you don't have to

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.100 
of playing actually you don't have to
but<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:31.160> think<00:05:32.160> that's<00:05:32.310> good<00:05:32.580> Oh<00:05:32.780> at<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.870> end<00:05:33.900> I

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
but I think that's good Oh at the end I

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.080 
but I think that's good Oh at the end I
was<00:05:34.230> doing<00:05:34.440> some<00:05:34.620> fast<00:05:34.830> lick<00:05:35.070> so<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.820> probably

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
was doing some fast lick so you probably

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.340 
was doing some fast lick so you probably
know<00:05:36.240> this<00:05:36.390> one<00:05:36.570> because<00:05:36.720> it's<00:05:36.840> very<00:05:36.960> common

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
know this one because it's very common

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.340 
know this one because it's very common
