00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.080
 It was the tiniest cable there was ever 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.000
 Times well two minutes separated wet 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 al attiyah from the win of the dakar rally 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.650
 In 2010, the team volkswagen pilot had to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 Himself teammate and valley legend 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 Carlos 1 hit 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 after months of preparation and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
 Thousands of kilometers through Argentina 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 and chile scared al attia imaginable 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 close to the big success over so 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 Some people might have a hard time for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 To motivate 2011 again 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.690
 very different the 39-year-old 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.550
 exceptional athletes from Qatar now know 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 we exactly what we for the next dakar 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 have to do 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 I am optimally mentally and physically 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.110
 prepared and we will give everything 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.530
 I am very confident that we are in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.530
 this year 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 wet al attiyah knows the feeling of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.500
 leaks very well 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.270
 already in 2006 he was able to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 Production car class of the rally 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 win world championship 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.659
 This was followed by 64 titles spread over four 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 different championships too 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.450
 his team knows that sporty 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.450
 to appreciate with exceptional talent 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.210
 as a driver, he is obviously very 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.920
 fast but the special is different 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.970
 that rather a pretty crazy guy 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 is next to the driving skills the plays 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.270
 Technology in the toughest rally of the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.430
 world a decisive role 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.979
 here, all animals themselves start with hand 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.990
 at medical training in hanover 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.390
 mechanics pilots as they are in 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 emergency her race touareg 3 again 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.310
 get roadworthy 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.540
 the goal is clear mission hat trick for 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 the whole team has the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.220
 title defense top priority 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.869
 just after the sensational 3-fold 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.240
 turn in 2010 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.740
 when it comes to wet al attiyah allowed 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.210
 the order on the podium 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.649
 but like to change a little 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.240
 Last year we have a good one 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.880
 fight and I really enjoyed that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.009
 but watch Carlos at the next 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 Dakar will be very hard for you
