00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.760
 Hello dear friends as I promised 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.309
 Here is a full review of the firmware claude 4 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.400
 and greets us with very bright firmware 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.349
 motley lock screen on it we 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.029
 we see already habitual for us to return them 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.760
 quick start which with ease 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.220
 you can change the settings and also see 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.619
 hours which like everyone in this lived 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.359
 different new design on screen 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.820
 You can add other locks. 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.040
 Widget and truth I've never used 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.410
 a visit on the lock screen he can 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.790
 it is useful to someone, but now 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.470
 let's try to unlock 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.049
 device 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.769
 here we are also waiting for a few innovations 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.790
 the first is at the entrance opportunity 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.589
 unlock smartphone 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.799
 using a combination of tapping on 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:55.190
 the display works on g2 this feature without 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.420
 problems if you disable the button 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.610
 we will have the opportunity again 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.170
 unlock the device in one tap 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.750
 enjoy the new effect 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.129
 unlocking unlocked smartphone we 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.200
 get on the main screen 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.320
 where we are also waiting for a lot of nice 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.270
 innovations eyes immediately rushes new 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.550
 and absolutely unusual for the user 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.010
 2 flat minimal design 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.920
 but it is worth noting that he is very beautiful 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.540
 more pleasant is probably the most 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.880
 beautiful shell android 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 oh well this is my subjective opinion 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.260
 and you may not agree with him 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.180
 despite the main design 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.370
 I consider the innovation of the initial screen 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.980
 appearance of voice activated google 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.310
 and it works perfectly even in 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.310
 Russian localization 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.870
 ok google what the weather will be tomorrow 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.330
 let me remind you that just a couple of months ago with 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 release android 4 4 kidka 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.770
 google turned on this chip just for legs 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.260
 with device and only in american 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.860
 localization and only with english language 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.380
 on board 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.479
 now we still have this rarely 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.580
 occurring lotion on lg g2 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.030
 also a noticeable change was given 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.709
 status bar and navigation bar but out 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 forest status couples everything is clear here 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.720
 just changed the design then with 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.300
 navigation keys question became 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.090
 the sides for indigenous users only 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.610
 this layout is not very to my liking 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.300
 The former is my green xisal on the contrary, very 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.980
 Conveniently this as but packs cheers we more 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.290
 we do not have a menu button 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.100
 for me personally, she was very tired of her 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.830
 worthlessness 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.709
 and cheers we have the multitasking button 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.750
 so it was in nexus just so not 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.580
 very convenient but unlike the same 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.040
 nexave here this button is implemented 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.260
 much more convenient you can change the size 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.870
 windows can be called on at the corner and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.460
 you can activate a mode 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.070
 multitasking 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.260
 about him a little more and hold the button 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.260
 home no longer pops up with a window 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.690
 open applications, but why button 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.120
 separate sheet but it turns on all that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.690
 same google it again is more convenient than it was 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.340
 before its upward phenomena button back 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.100
 also less on functionality 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.110
 if you hold it absolute appears 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.360
 new feature which is available in this 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.940
 firmware, I'm talking about the full 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.560
 multitasking so on one screen you 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.440
 can work in two applications at once 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.810
 and it is very convenient if from the main 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.980
 the wedding screen and the right will open like this 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.950
 called screen g 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.320
 there used to be just advertisements now 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.000
 well it is very health quite comfortable and 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.850
 pleasant and allows you to monitor applications 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.830
 for your health justice for the sake of 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.970
 I want to note that the application is like 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.680
 most trackers 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.960
 works based on data 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.370
 accelerometer that 's not always accurate 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.220
 determines the number of steps 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.760
 but you can easily screw it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.050
 It is necessary in the second half of the screen g 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.320
 occupy the so-called tips 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.480
 it's all the same reklamki is better but to whom 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.940
 this screen doesn't need it easily you can 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.070
 remove settings by the way about settings 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.650
 they almost did not change 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.260
 Naturally new design and appeared 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.940
 some items but generally so to speak 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.980
 skeleton tuned remained the same 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.170
 this is where one of the most 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.970
 major firmware bugs lack 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.400
 the ability to remove applications from 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.950
 settings but do not rush to spit 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.230
 programs can be removed just change 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.930
 also does this radio not work 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.720
 firmware for me is again not 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.760
 critical another significant 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.190
 the change was the camera more precisely its 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.980
 application let's start right away with 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.450
 sad in the new application is missing 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.910
 manual focus adjustment 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.460
 I love to take pictures of something on 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.680
 fly on your smartphone this and chose your 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.500
 g2 time for his excellent camera and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.430
 many times I was saved by manual focus here 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.130
 they took him away 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.160
 sad but there are undoubted advantages 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.150
 this application 1 plus that button 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.610
 video recording 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.470
 next to the snapshot button finally we 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.410
 got rid of the sliders and time 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.120
 switch between shooting modes 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.100
 second plus is the ability to record 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.220
 video at 120 frames per second with 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.250
 hd resolution and 30 frames per second 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.870
 ultra hd resolution 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.770
 also me personally surprised app 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.530
 google camera 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.360
 she was on my nexus but g2 on 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.669
 stock firmware I could not it 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.020
 put and here it is serve 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.990
 We become on the standard application 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.280
 camera if everything is clear with pictures 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.310
 almost nothing to change 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.630
 video recordings have some questions 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.960
 for example, where did the opportunity come from 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.400
 video recording 120 frames per second or with 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.590
 ultra hd resolution 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.139
 if the camera module and processor remain 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.960
 the former most likely the whole thing 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.910
 software and just go 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.370
 rumors that the same is used in g3 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.660
 camera module that their same 2 only with 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.660
 improved stabilization system 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.419
 images can be therefore on g2 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.030
 everything works for 120 frames 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.870
 second it turns out and ultra hd with 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.110
 3840 x 2160 resolution 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.490
 it turns out a wonderful other question in 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.040
 tom who needs it 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.350
 because most devices today have 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.620
 permission full hd and there without a difference 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.500
 ultra hd video to watch or full hd 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.840
 but the fact remains ultra and wait here 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.250
 there is 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.880
 implementation of slush can many not 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.310
 will like 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.500
 however, I like the opposite 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.570
 the solution i can and on the phone when 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.990
 watching noticed any moment which 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.300
 want 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.310
 and on the computer process the video with 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.000
 quality loss all other chips 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.190
 eljay such as you slide like mom 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.880
 mount slide site tilt and stuff 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.530
 works great helping you in your work 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.080
 personal and from the beginning would like 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.880
 leave stock android on your g20 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.430
 the solution of these buns did not give me that 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.350
 do now i have changed with confidence 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.780
 firmware and so far not a bit sorry 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.000
 because here and branded chips from 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.150
 elji stayed and beautiful design 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.160
 added 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.890
 even as for me to improve the sound 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.260
 device with both a headphone and 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.050
 speakers began to play louder I do not know 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.660
 can so I thought maybe it's because 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.180
 and there is but that I definitely do not 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.190
 it seemed so that the device lives 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.000
 a bit longer average for about an hour 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.590
 one and a half but even this increase pleases 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.020
 conclusion I want to say that despite 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.090
 its novelty firmware is devoid of serious 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.520
 lateral problems where there are small 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.680
 nuances of course but for me personally they are not 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.790
 Essentially you are lovers of something 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.520
 new fresh 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:38.220
 I definitely recommend those to whom 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.660
 need 100% stability of course 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.660
 it's worth a little wait
