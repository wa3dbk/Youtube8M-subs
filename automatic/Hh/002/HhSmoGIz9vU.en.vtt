00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hello, I 'm Marcelo Darghan, and today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.240
 I decided to change this wall behind me and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 one of the options that I ask myself is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.389
 how to apply a fabric on a wall 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.949
 I thought it was a good choice that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 transform this wall with tissues 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 so for that the glue expression 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.869
 white frame a bob was a bar that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.429
 can make the boundary between the wall 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.990
 and the crepe tape fabric a brush and a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 foam roll 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 come on good, this word has been good 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 Clean, I 'm going to take this mirror off the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.730
 socket, there is no problem after pointing the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.149
 fabric so you can adjust to make it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.690
 first to pick up the indigo fabric in the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.690
 wall 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.690
 with the crepe tape or hold it here only 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.690
 of that measure 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.399
 I put some white glue here 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.649
 diluted in water a little bit 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.399
 then the name of two of water for 8 of 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.710
 paste 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.750
 We already talked here very fast, I already passed 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.299
 in the foam roller and apply this was the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.220
 disc on the wall and apply already offered 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.840
 in the sequence we will gradually 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 prevent it from happening in the future because it has 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 some problem 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:28.430
 he has to have a space there can help 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.430
 to be avoided in the appliance 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.260
 Some people feel fine on the wall, I'm going 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.780
 pass the roll over it now with 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.610
 white glue also this work goes 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.440
 interdict a fabric will be better 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.980
 still with the application done since it 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 dry after drying if you want can 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.060
 spend a play varnish semi gloss 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.310
 frosted not bright any item 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.170
 possession of a great player gives a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.690
 of the fabric to make the finish 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.140
 do not get over seeding straight here you 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:10.770
 you can simply make a white glue 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 in this bar and apply exactly in the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.320
 meeting the fabric with the wall its glue 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 it will not be enough to stick to 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.890
 frame here you can use the braguinha 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.160
 apply this to the wall and do 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.370
 exhaust 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.870
 she has a weight she was on the wall then 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.520
 do not need anything to ensure 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 to keep it from falling 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.290
 This is a good and cheap option for 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.880
 do this you can have lots of fun 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 doing this calls someone to help you 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.420
 because it gets much better and an option 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.680
 cool too know what you pick up a 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.350
 wood board plywood mdf some 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.989
 cockroach or lightweight way also 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.330
 apply to the fabric in the wood makes a 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.790
 set of nice decorated wood 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.739
 with fabric and apply these woods as 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.480
 if it was a reminder on the wall 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.880
 You're just you seek to make a small hole with 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.519
 the screw bushing and finishes the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.280
 same way with fat the frame that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.600
 It's cool, I should have liked life. 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.600
 working even longer
