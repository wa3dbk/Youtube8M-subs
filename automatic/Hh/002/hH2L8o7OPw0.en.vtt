 they the boys here pablo with the 93 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:22.510
 with a producer already of the most 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.910
 we are according to them I have more effect one 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.100
 but as I know that this is a great car 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.450
 certainly go in the next video that 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.680
 rise will be the most effects since 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.540
 the story is very close and has 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.380
 played one is that you die of desire for 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.380
 out glücksmann 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:51.580
 to see guys the first thing would be to go 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.580
 to this games page torrent 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.990
 you see more limited edition worth the girl 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.660
 to download torrents 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.250
 but of course that tutor of the death 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.770
 order has to be open if it does not come out 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 error we save click on 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 in the saints the parts of we give ok 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.120
 and begins to download it 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.880
 once it is one hundred percent like 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.740
 this we give right click open with time 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.740
 folder or open container folder 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.659
 It is not valid, it is considered because it is not 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.149
 has been downloaded with still worth 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.679
 but I did not know exactly this is true 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.249
 the parts by which they are composed 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.249
 they played 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.670
 Let's see 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.070
 suppose this is more effective 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.070
 we would get inside part 1 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.680
 and he sold us an iso like here 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.570
 he sold us an iso we would extract in 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.260
 desk 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.789
 to accept 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.900
 vale kids are already extracted 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.460
 and as you see forgiveness was not one were two 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
 dvds 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.980
 my fault goes from the bottom I had something does not happen 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.650
 nothing 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.630
 It's not worth as you see now let's ride 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.620
 to assemble the images we open the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
 montull 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.890
 we select the images and boiled 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.220
 cams 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.200
 we select the dvd 1 we make sure 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.200
 let's put 1 we're going to ride 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.489
 and stop already dvd 1 is mounted then 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.000
 right now I should know that an author 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.130
 one thing that I do not get in not being a 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.569
 person 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.849
 the leader 1 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.610
 I do not know why he does not know author so we 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.790
 let's start 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.250
 the team we go to this in case 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.970
 that does not leave the car rumba of us 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.900
 we put in here and execute the author 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 name vctor mal 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.650
 let's identify and breed that puts 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.329
 viewed 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.329
 let's see we give it years 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.140
 perfect 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.230
 we give the following I accept next 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.100
 it's going to be installed on that disk and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.180
 this program follows 86 Vctor Valdés the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.760
 gold effect folder 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.650
 create and with the next desktop 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.930
 install 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.170
 baldi I am the typical installation of 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.720
 wait we are worth vale5 sa asks us 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.819
 insert we need the following 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.099
 disc makes it active we give it a key 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.700
 home windows key with the mainz 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.019
 we see the da montull we select dvd 2 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.019
 and we give him to ride 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.170
 evans and is now mounted without doing 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.780
 just touching the band showed key and 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.480
 continue and to see guys once you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.910
 ends installation tells us the one from which 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.150
 without touching anything because as I say 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.730
 ok and now we get an estimated time 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.960
 of to finish here about three 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.350
 minutes is worth and after being direct x 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.890
 follow now finishes installation voucher 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.410
 Boys 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.920
 then when after it's over 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.270
 the extraction is files or whatever 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.600
 I love no idea we're going to accept the contract 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.610
 following 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.409
 friends to me will not do anything because 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.339
 say that I have the most recent so 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.419
 the blog x determined that is already 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.729
 installed a newer version 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.210
 equivalent direct x the necessary 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.259
 installation 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.259
 silvia knew 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 Right 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.710
 ok it says insert dvd or not any 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.710
 problem 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.170
 come back one 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:34.449
 inserted 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.449
 tries 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.300
 well this does not have to imply that 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.120
 she is called the installation vale 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.970
 and now I'm going to try the game to see if 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.490
 they work correctly ballistic vale 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:55.319
 as I told you that does not imply that the game 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.289
 it worked badly that came out to me because it looks 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.690
 I have the disc of perpetado I have left 12 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.500
 with 6 are free and that's why he has 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.320
 he left 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.990
 the iron since we observe has to 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.900
 get out ok unless you have little 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.750
 memory like me but 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.180
 I do not know if anything is as you see and I do 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.729
 double click despite all game in 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.560
 Spanish play set up service 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.050
 technical 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.150
 and as I do I will always record a 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.160
 minute two of game so you can see that 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.139
 graphics work correctly 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.139
