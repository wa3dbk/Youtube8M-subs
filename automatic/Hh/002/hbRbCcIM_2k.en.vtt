00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
cards there's the HD and then there's

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
cards there's the HD and then there's
others<00:00:35.489> excuse<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.120> there's<00:00:36.300> SD<00:00:36.719> cards<00:00:37.140> and

others excuse me there's SD cards and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
others excuse me there's SD cards and
then<00:00:37.589> there's<00:00:39.050> sdhc<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.920> secure<00:00:41.429> digital<00:00:41.640> but

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
then there's sdhc so secure digital but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.599 
then there's sdhc so secure digital but
then<00:00:42.269> secure<00:00:42.690> digital<00:00:42.870> high<00:00:43.109> capacity<00:00:43.609> I

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
then secure digital high capacity I

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.579 
then secure digital high capacity I
think<00:00:45.179> is<00:00:45.269> when<00:00:45.359> you<00:00:45.449> get<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.749> two<00:00:45.929> gigs<00:00:46.260> and

mark<00:02:39.050> our<00:02:39.170> batteries<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:39.800> we've<00:02:40.010> done

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
mark our batteries because we've done

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.540 
mark our batteries because we've done
some<00:02:40.370> long-term<00:02:40.550> battery<00:02:41.120> testing<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.400> they

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
some long-term battery testing so they

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.090 
some long-term battery testing so they
come<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:43.880> these<00:02:44.030> sort<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.360> small<00:02:44.570> plastic

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
come with these sort of small plastic

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.580 
come with these sort of small plastic
covers<00:02:46.100> which<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.489> fine<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.959> problem<00:02:48.500> is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
covers which are fine but the problem is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.350 
covers which are fine but the problem is
taking<00:02:49.220> them<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.550> out<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.700> them<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.150> just

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
taking them in and out of them was just

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.880 
taking them in and out of them was just
too<00:02:50.540> much<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.900> hassle<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.410> once<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.709> add<00:02:51.860> a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
too much of a hassle and once you add a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.220 
too much of a hassle and once you add a
bunch<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.250> these<00:02:52.400> together<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.870> carrying<00:02:54.170> a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
bunch of these together here carrying a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.199 
bunch of these together here carrying a
lot<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:54.380> stuff<00:02:54.650> around<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.940> don't<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:56.150> if

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
lot of stuff around so I don't know if

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.699 
lot of stuff around so I don't know if
you've<00:02:56.360> watched<00:02:56.510> our<00:02:56.690> video<00:02:56.959> will<00:02:57.200> link<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.560> it

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
you've watched our video will link to it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.699 
you've watched our video will link to it
we<00:02:58.190> made<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.520> little<00:02:58.989> secret<00:02:59.989> or<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.500> guess

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
we made this little secret or I guess

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.340 
we made this little secret or I guess
altoids<00:03:01.370> tin<00:03:01.630> was<00:03:02.630> just<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> perfect<00:03:02.989> size

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
altoids tin was just the perfect size

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.229 
altoids tin was just the perfect size
for<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:04.100> size<00:03:05.030> SD<00:03:05.270> cards<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.500> did<00:03:06.770> is<00:03:06.800> I

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
for to size SD cards what I did is I

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.820 
for to size SD cards what I did is I
folded<00:03:08.239> up<00:03:08.390> one<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.660> our<00:03:08.720> business<00:03:09.140> cards<00:03:09.350> and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.470 

put<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.950> inside<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.790> others<00:03:14.150> too

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
put it inside of here that others too

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.780 
put it inside of here that others too
it's<00:03:14.720> not<00:03:14.840> high-tech<00:03:15.020> or<00:03:15.410> anything<00:03:15.769> after<00:03:16.760> a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's not high-tech or anything after a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.430 
it's not high-tech or anything after a
couple<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.209> tries<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.660> figured<00:03:17.989> out<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.320> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
couple of tries I figured out that the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.810 
couple of tries I figured out that the
only<00:03:18.560> trick<00:03:18.890> really<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.459> make<00:03:19.610> sure<00:03:19.640> that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
only trick really is to make sure that

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.670 
only trick really is to make sure that
this<00:03:20.120> middle<00:03:20.540> wall<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:21.230> right<00:03:21.709> up<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.190> edge

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
this middle wall is right up to the edge

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.530 
this middle wall is right up to the edge
so<00:03:24.680> we<00:03:24.799> keep<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.760> empty<00:03:26.060> ones<00:03:26.239> over

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
so we keep the you the empty ones over

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.250 
so we keep the you the empty ones over
here<00:03:27.250> all<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.370> these<00:03:28.489> are<00:03:28.519> ready<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.940> go<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:30.080> put

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
here all of these are ready to go to put

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.120 
here all of these are ready to go to put
into<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> camera<00:03:30.950> or<00:03:31.600> whatever<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.840> then<00:03:33.799> on

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
into a camera or whatever and then on

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.550 
into a camera or whatever and then on
this<00:03:34.400> side<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.820> got<00:03:35.000> some<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:36.230> know<00:03:36.350> have

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
this side of got some that you know have

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.250 
this side of got some that you know have
stuff<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.580> them<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.120> once<00:03:38.510> they're<00:03:38.720> empty<00:03:39.080> they

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
stuff on them so once they're empty they

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.259 
stuff on them so once they're empty they
would<00:03:39.410> go<00:03:39.530> back<00:03:39.709> over<00:03:40.040> here<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:41.090> we'll

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
would go back over here so now we'll

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.310 
would go back over here so now we'll
have<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.570> sort<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.840> do<00:03:41.959> something<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> little

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
have to sort of do something a little

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.830 
have to sort of do something a little
different<00:03:42.590> probably<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.640> think<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.420> have<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> one

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
different probably I think I have a one

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.110 
different probably I think I have a one
gig<00:03:45.079> in<00:03:45.320> here<00:03:45.530> somewhere<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.160> i'll<00:03:46.880> probably

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
gig in here somewhere and i'll probably

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.660 
gig in here somewhere and i'll probably
remove<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.780> since<00:03:48.110> with<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.980> eight<00:03:49.130> gigs<00:03:49.459> we

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
remove it since with the eight gigs we

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.979 
remove it since with the eight gigs we
just<00:03:49.850> don't<00:03:50.000> want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.180> waste<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.480> real<00:03:50.630> estate

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.060 

it'll<00:03:56.989> easily<00:03:57.230> hold<00:03:58.810> we've<00:03:59.810> got<00:04:00.079> five<00:04:00.350> on<00:04:00.709> this

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
it'll easily hold we've got five on this

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.330 
it'll easily hold we've got five on this
side<00:04:01.280> right<00:04:01.310> now<00:04:01.549> i<00:04:02.620> could<00:04:03.620> probably<00:04:04.010> put<00:04:04.310> a

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
side right now i could probably put a

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.150 
side right now i could probably put a
six<00:04:04.700> in<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.560> then<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.739> way<00:04:06.890> i<00:04:06.920> could

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
six in there and then that way i could

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.810 
six in there and then that way i could
hold<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.489> dozen<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.000> these<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.480> had<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:09.820> about

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
hold a dozen of these if I had to about

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.580 
hold a dozen of these if I had to about
10<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.090> them<00:04:11.329> real<00:04:11.480> easily<00:04:11.720> right<00:04:12.350> now<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.500> have

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
10 of them real easily right now I have

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.830 
10 of them real easily right now I have
like<00:04:12.920> eight<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.250> here<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.419> suppose<00:04:17.570> now

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
like eight in here and I suppose now

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.960 
like eight in here and I suppose now
that<00:04:17.870> I've<00:04:18.109> got<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.500> eight<00:04:18.709> gigabyte<00:04:19.190> cards

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
that I've got the eight gigabyte cards

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.760 
that I've got the eight gigabyte cards
I'm<00:04:20.660> going<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.900> go<00:04:21.080> ahead<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.380> do<00:04:21.470> something

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
I'm going to go ahead and do something

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.300 
I'm going to go ahead and do something
with<00:04:21.799> this<00:04:21.979> case<00:04:22.280> either<00:04:22.870> take<00:04:23.870> some

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
with this case either take some

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.770 
with this case either take some
cleaner<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.520> wipe<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.850> down<00:04:27.000> get<00:04:27.449> rid<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.630> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
cleaner and wipe it down get rid of the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.900 
cleaner and wipe it down get rid of the
paint<00:04:27.990> or<00:04:28.260> go<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.100> other<00:04:29.130> way<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.669> paint

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
paint or go the other way and just paint

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:40.270 
paint or go the other way and just paint
over<00:04:30.090> it
