consoles you create huge world it's with

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
consoles you create huge world it's with
a<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:50.910> level<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.239> detail<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.899> think

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
a pretty good level of detail I think

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
a pretty good level of detail I think
what<00:00:52.469> we're<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:53.129> been<00:00:53.309> traditionally

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
what we're have been traditionally

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
what we're have been traditionally
interested<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.620> really<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.550> know

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
interested in is going really you know

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
interested in is going really you know
get<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> power<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
get it using that to the power of the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
get it using that to the power of the
platform<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.239> deeper<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> deeper

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
platform to really go deeper and deeper

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
platform to really go deeper and deeper
and<00:01:01.109> deeper<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.710> level<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> detail

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and deeper into that level of detail

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
and deeper into that level of detail
because<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.879> us<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.570> makes<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> world<00:01:03.960> real

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because for us what makes the world real

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
because for us what makes the world real
is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> incredible<00:01:05.220> amount<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> detail<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is the incredible amount of detail it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.969 
is the incredible amount of detail it
has<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> go<00:01:07.170> into<00:01:07.290> any<00:01:07.470> room<00:01:07.740> you

their living room this house a great
story<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.270> infinite<00:01:18.689> we've<00:01:18.810> sort<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
story then with infinite we've sort of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
story then with infinite we've sort of
done<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.250> sort<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> used<00:01:20.939> the

done that and then sort of used the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
done that and then sort of used the
processing<00:01:21.509> power<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.130> life

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
processing power get to put more life

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
processing power get to put more life
into<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> characters<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.600> world<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
into the characters in the world and I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
into the characters in the world and I
think<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.500> something<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.460> would

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
think that's something that we would

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
think that's something that we would
continue<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> double<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.680> our

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
continue to double down on is our

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
continue to double down on is our

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and a half and was just introduced in to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.719 
and a half and was just introduced in to
Elizabeth<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.049> guess<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.890> interested<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.670> how

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
Elizabeth I guess I'm interested in how

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
Elizabeth I guess I'm interested in how
you<00:01:44.880> developed<00:01:45.360> her<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> character<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you developed her as a character and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
you developed her as a character and
what<00:01:46.619> role<00:01:46.890> she's<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> play<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
what role she's going to play I when I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.100 
what role she's going to play I when I
stopped<00:01:48.720> playing<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.409> hadn't<00:01:50.189> quite<00:01:50.399> really

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
really we have this Beach sequence where

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.910 
really we have this Beach sequence where
that<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.320> first<00:01:58.500> time<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.710> were<00:01:58.829> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that was the first time we were with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.969 
that was the first time we were with
Elizabeth<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.520> she's<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.270> completely<00:02:01.259> nai

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
Elizabeth and she's just completely nai

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.030 
Elizabeth and she's just completely nai
and<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.469> she<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.009> the

of interactions you have with the
environment<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.369> our<00:02:08.520> normandy<00:02:08.970> beach

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
environment that was our normandy beach

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.490 
environment that was our normandy beach
where<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.660> kept<00:02:09.869> getting<00:02:10.020> mowed<00:02:10.470> down

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
where we just kept getting mowed down

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.180 
where we just kept getting mowed down
over

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
over

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.760 
over
over<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:12.030> where<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.840> kept<00:02:13.020> trying<00:02:13.380> her<00:02:13.650> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
over again where we kept trying her and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.840 
over again where we kept trying her and
she<00:02:13.830> kept<00:02:13.980> breaking<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.520> trying<00:02:14.760> them

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
she kept breaking and trying them

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.700 
she kept breaking and trying them
breaking<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.900> our<00:02:15.990> theories<00:02:16.350> are<00:02:16.500> played

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
breaking all of our theories are played

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.470 
breaking all of our theories are played
out<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.580> one<00:02:17.790> area<00:02:17.820> because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
out on that in that one area because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.910 
out on that in that one area because
it's<00:02:18.720> an<00:02:18.780> area<00:02:18.960> where<00:02:19.080> basically<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.590> as

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it's an area where basically you as

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.100 
it's an area where basically you as
Booker<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.460> walk<00:02:20.640> around<00:02:20.990> your<00:02:21.990> with

drives that and you drive it based about
where<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:52.560> was<00:02:52.710> very

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
where you go and that was very

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.500 
where you go and that was very
experimental<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.700> whole<00:02:53.880> part<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.270> we<00:02:54.390> knew

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
experimental that whole part and we knew

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.150 
experimental that whole part and we knew
if<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.630> got<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.020> right<00:02:55.260> we'd<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.130> good

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
if we got that right we'd be in good

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.590 
if we got that right we'd be in good
stead<00:02:56.520> for<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.850> rest<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> game<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.540> we

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
stead for the rest of the game so we

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.390 
stead for the rest of the game so we
spent<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> ton<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.200> time<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
spent a ton of time there because the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.770 
spent a ton of time there because the
moment<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.670> turn<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.210> at<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.330> companion

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
moment you turn you look at a companion

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960 
moment you turn you look at a companion
AI<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.260> they're<00:03:01.350> doing<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.710> these<00:03:01.970> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
AI and they're doing one of these it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.720 
AI and they're doing one of these it's
over<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.630> either<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.930> robot<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.980> why<00:03:05.370> go

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
over you know either a robot so why go

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.330 
over you know either a robot so why go
through<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> effort<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.450> she<00:03:06.980> what<00:03:07.980> was<00:03:08.130> your

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
through that effort is she what was your

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
through that effort is she what was your
reasoning<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:08.940> wanting<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.540> add<00:03:09.690> all<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.930> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
reasoning for wanting to add all of that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.980 
reasoning for wanting to add all of that
to<00:03:10.440> her<00:03:10.560> look<00:03:11.520> what<00:03:11.910> do<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.090> want<00:03:12.390> out<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.690> games

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
to her look what do we want out of games

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.620 
to her look what do we want out of games
I<00:03:13.440> mean<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.980> think<00:03:14.010> eventually<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.880> want<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
I mean I think eventually we want to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.620 
I mean I think eventually we want to
feel<00:03:15.870> an<00:03:16.380> experience<00:03:17.040> where<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.760> things

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
feel an experience where you have things

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.300 
feel an experience where you have things
impact<00:03:18.989> upon<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.470> emotional<00:03:20.010> where<00:03:20.160> you're

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
impact upon you emotional where you're

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.420 
impact upon you emotional where you're
engaged<00:03:20.850> where<00:03:21.209> were<00:03:21.390> those<00:03:21.600> sort<00:03:22.110> of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
engaged where were those sort of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.830 
engaged where were those sort of
barriers<00:03:23.430> start<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.209> break<00:03:24.390> down<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
barriers start to break down and it

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.390 
barriers start to break down and it
doesn't<00:03:25.050> mean<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.860> isn't<00:03:25.980> necessarily

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
doesn't mean like it isn't necessarily

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.370 
doesn't mean like it isn't necessarily
