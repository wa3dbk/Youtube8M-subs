 summer since there is such a decent spf30 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.620
 hypo-hype allergen does not contain a tank 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.960
 no fragrance without parabens nickname on 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.210
 genetically approved by dermatologists 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.370
 yet it is suitable for sensitive skin 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.199
 but the total powder was presented in three 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.019

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.710
 that such a package is most likely this 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.160
 mass times here 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.839

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 it opens it means this way 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:10.220
 10 plain plastic not to powder itself and 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.430
 there is still a mirror section 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.070
 such a mirror here and a mirror 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.410
 here is a brush compartment here 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.530
 Here is such a brush is very soft 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.100
 smooth such from artificial pile and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 here is such a compartment as such 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.140
 find a strainer in the holes very small 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 such grinding powder and finish such 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.620
 satin and you are not matt she is mating but 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.230
 finish at her 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.310
 Satin and very beautiful finish where this 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 powder seems to me even possible 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.120
 use as as highlighter 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.010
 it is determined very evenly 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.710
 some obvious flaws again not 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.990
 hide but evens the complexion 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.280
 I liked well enough 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.780
 brush is not convenient to apply on all face 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.910
 Well, because as you can see, she is completely 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.510
 small and stated on the box was 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.490
 something kabuki tassel that's uncomfortable and 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.230
 put on all face all the same but in 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 marching conditions at NKVD and can not 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.090
 You know, this brush is convenient to apply on 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.170
 the wings of the nose powder by the way is very convenient 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.660
 it masks enlarged pores somehow 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.459
 overrides she can principle 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.640
 useful to you even in applying makeup 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.010
 and other powder 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 on the nose but not necessary to correct 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.000
 every two to three hours 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.120
 any means rush to apply every 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.980
 two hours two or three hours so me she 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.150

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.160
 I liked it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.410
 plastic packaging is not glass here 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.490
 the applicator is such as lip gloss 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.640
 fruity smell 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.739
 sweet very nice stotinki elephant 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.760
 Nathan's bones for 2 probably lighter than 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.770
 my skin is basically concealer and should 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.989
 be lighter than your natural color 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.230
 skin tone skin drop under the eyes 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.870
 the texture of it is so dryish a little 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.150
 the assumption is that the powder is diluted 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.680
 with a little bit of water she is not such an association I 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.600
 fasten patreon sits perfectly 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.209

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.700
 rolled into the wrinkles have not scored in 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.860
 principle a good concealer but at least 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.110
 a bit of that creamy texture 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.660

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.840
