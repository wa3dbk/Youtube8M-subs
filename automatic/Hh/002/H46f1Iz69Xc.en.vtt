00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
map arm I turned it all into one piece
rather<00:01:24.030> than<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.110> separate

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
rather than going with two separate

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.810 
rather than going with two separate
receivers<00:01:26.479> since<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.630> build<00:01:27.869> our<00:01:28.049> own<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
receivers since we build our own and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.920 
receivers since we build our own and
it's<00:01:29.820> working<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.509> well<00:01:32.720> build<00:01:33.720> my

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

this wheels also from Grizzlies I some

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.130 
this wheels also from Grizzlies I some
use<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.370> same<00:02:39.640> idea<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.030> some<00:02:40.750> other<00:02:40.900> guys

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
use the same idea that some other guys

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.500 
use the same idea that some other guys
have<00:02:41.320> done<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.680> there<00:02:42.000> bored<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.180> our<00:02:43.360> own

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
have done out there bored out our own

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.199 
have done out there bored out our own
that<00:02:43.750> was<00:02:43.900> big<00:02:44.709> cost<00:02:45.010> savings<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.580> opinions

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
that was big cost savings of opinions

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.680 
that was big cost savings of opinions
and<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.920> think<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:48.670> around<00:02:49.300> 70<00:02:49.810> bucks<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
and I think they're around 70 bucks and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.780 
and I think they're around 70 bucks and
it's<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.489> turning<00:02:54.489> into<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.730> real<00:02:55.150> nice<00:02:55.690> wheel<00:02:56.790> my

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
it's a turning into a real nice wheel my

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.979 
it's a turning into a real nice wheel my
track<00:02:58.090> tension<00:02:58.540> arm<00:02:58.900> and<00:03:00.000> tracking<00:03:01.000> assembly

track tension arm and tracking assembly

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.830 
track tension arm and tracking assembly
I<00:03:02.019> used<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.070> design<00:03:03.459> Michael<00:03:04.209> clerk<00:03:04.450> could<00:03:04.660> be

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
I used the design Michael clerk could be

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.009 
I used the design Michael clerk could be
drawn<00:03:05.049> up<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.709> internet<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.900> changed<00:03:07.900> a

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
drawn up on the internet and changed a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.500 
drawn up on the internet and changed a
few<00:03:08.200> things<00:03:10.079> made<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.110> bigger<00:03:11.440> back<00:03:12.510> support

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
few things made a bigger back support

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.440 
few things made a bigger back support
made<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.200> thicker<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.860> had<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.450> table

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
made it thicker because I had the table

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.080 
made it thicker because I had the table
that<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.630> could<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:18.870> rather<00:03:19.870> than<00:03:20.019> bolting<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
that I could and rather than bolting the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.039

tracking hinges on hinge points on we

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.319 
tracking hinges on hinge points on we
welded<00:03:26.500> them<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.760> gave<00:03:27.940> me<00:03:28.180> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
welded them and that gave me the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.949 
welded them and that gave me the
opportunity<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:29.140> set<00:03:30.130> my<00:03:30.340> spring<00:03:31.030> back<00:03:31.930> a

opportunity to set my spring back a
little<00:03:32.320> farther<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.100> give<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.180> little<00:03:34.329> bit

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
little farther and give it a little bit

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.910 
little farther and give it a little bit
better<00:03:34.870> alignment<00:03:35.610> worked<00:03:36.610> out<00:03:36.850> really<00:03:37.030> well

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
better alignment worked out really well

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.069 
better alignment worked out really well
got<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:40.079> KBD<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.110> 27<00:03:41.860> d<00:03:42.040> digital<00:03:42.579> controller

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
built it fell off on the floor but I

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.500 
built it fell off on the floor but I
have<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.079> bracket<00:03:50.320> up<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:50.829> like<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.510> Bomont

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
have a bracket up here like the Bomont

in front of that a little bit the back
of<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.220> just<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.860> do<00:04:03.040> something

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
of it just just to do something

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.640 

and<00:04:13.300> then<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:14.190> created<00:04:15.840> our<00:04:16.840> version<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.470> the

as<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.729> see<00:04:23.010> rather<00:04:24.010> than<00:04:24.220> using<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.639> clamp

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
as you can see rather than using a clamp

small<00:05:21.490> wheel<00:05:21.729> attachment<00:05:22.539> and<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:25.080> bunch<00:05:26.080> of

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
small wheel attachment and a bunch of

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.909 
small wheel attachment and a bunch of
the<00:05:26.380> wheels<00:05:28.139> bought<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.349> rubber<00:05:29.560> from

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
the wheels bought the rubber from

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.740 
the wheels bought the rubber from
McMaster<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:32.530> Rachid<00:05:33.099> on<00:05:33.970> those<00:05:34.210> videos<00:05:34.599> you

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
McMaster the Rachid on those videos you

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.450 
McMaster the Rachid on those videos you
see<00:05:34.960> on<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.289> Internet<00:05:35.680> he'd<00:05:35.919> done<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.430> I

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
see on the Internet he'd done that I

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.640 
see on the Internet he'd done that I
can't<00:05:36.729> remember<00:05:36.910> his<00:05:37.060> real<00:05:37.090> name<00:05:37.450> but<00:05:37.690> got

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
can't remember his real name but got

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.580 
can't remember his real name but got
that<00:05:38.970> idea<00:05:39.970> from<00:05:40.270> him<00:05:40.690> about<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.260> smallest

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
that idea from him about the smallest

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.629 
that idea from him about the smallest
one<00:05:42.039> from<00:05:42.340> Beaumont<00:05:42.820> because<00:05:43.780> I<00:05:43.870> couldn't

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
one from Beaumont because I couldn't

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.550 
one from Beaumont because I couldn't
didn't<00:05:45.639> think<00:05:45.880> my<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.570> rubber<00:05:46.810> would<00:05:47.020> work<00:05:47.260> to

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
didn't think my the rubber would work to

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.879 
didn't think my the rubber would work to
stay<00:05:48.490> on<00:05:48.700> but<00:05:49.380> they're<00:05:50.380> working<00:05:50.800> out<00:05:52.889> the

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
stay on but they're working out the

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.230 
stay on but they're working out the
gearing<00:05:54.160> on<00:05:54.370> this<00:05:54.550> thing<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:54.910> little<00:05:55.030> high

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
gearing on this thing is a little high

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.670 
gearing on this thing is a little high
right<00:05:55.419> now<00:05:55.599> I've<00:05:55.720> got<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> five<00:05:56.139> inch<00:05:56.380> on<00:05:56.590> the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
right now I've got a five inch on the

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.960 
right now I've got a five inch on the
motor<00:05:56.889> but<00:05:57.160> I'm<00:05:57.310> going<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.490> go<00:05:57.580> down<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:57.940> a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
motor but I'm going to go down to a

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.760 
motor but I'm going to go down to a
three<00:05:58.360> I've<00:05:58.750> already<00:05:59.080> found<00:05:59.260> out<00:05:59.500> that<00:05:59.620> it's

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
three I've already found out that it's

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.700 
three I've already found out that it's
too<00:05:59.950> high<00:06:00.130> geared<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:00.960> I've<00:06:01.960> burned<00:06:02.229> up<00:06:02.440> one

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
too high geared and I've burned up one

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.600 
too high geared and I've burned up one
of<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:02.950> bearings<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:04.800> got<00:06:05.800> a<00:06:05.830> another<00:06:06.400> one

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
of the bearings and got a another one

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.110 
of the bearings and got a another one
coming<00:06:07.000> I'm<00:06:07.120> going<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:07.389> get<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:07.990> replaced<00:06:08.260> but

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
coming I'm going to get it replaced but

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.060 
coming I'm going to get it replaced but
to<00:06:11.120> set<00:06:11.330> up<00:06:11.480> its<00:06:11.660> at<00:06:11.900> right<00:06:12.170> now<00:06:12.440> it's<00:06:12.740> running

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
to set up its at right now it's running

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.350 
to set up its at right now it's running
11<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.700> top<00:06:13.970> speed<00:06:14.300> 11,000<00:06:15.230> 284<00:06:16.220> feet<00:06:17.030> per

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
11 a top speed 11,000 284 feet per

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.220 
11 a top speed 11,000 284 feet per
second<00:06:18.280> and<00:06:19.280> that's<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.760> little<00:06:20.120> too<00:06:20.270> fast<00:06:20.540> I'm

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
second and that's a little too fast I'm

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.370 
second and that's a little too fast I'm
high<00:06:21.410> speed<00:06:22.120> but<00:06:23.120> I'll<00:06:23.270> turn<00:06:23.540> it<00:06:23.690> on<00:06:23.780> with<00:06:24.230> this

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
high speed but I'll turn it on with this

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.050 
high speed but I'll turn it on with this
big<00:06:24.620> contact<00:06:25.100> will<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.370> can<00:06:25.580> run<00:06:25.730> it<00:06:25.940> without

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
big contact will I can run it without

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.380 
big contact will I can run it without
heating<00:06:26.450> up<00:06:26.660> bearings<00:06:27.050> so<00:06:28.060> I'll<00:06:29.060> show<00:06:29.360> you

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
heating up bearings so I'll show you

00:06:29.390 --> 00:07:48.879 
heating up bearings so I'll show you
just<00:06:29.540> temporarily<00:06:30.350> what<00:06:30.800> it<00:06:30.920> sounds<00:06:31.280> like
