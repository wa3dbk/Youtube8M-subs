very<00:02:00.270> satisfying<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.200> also<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.070> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
very satisfying and also I think it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
very satisfying and also I think it
probably<00:02:02.850> put<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> game<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.750> Spurs<00:02:04.140> reach

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
probably put the game out of Spurs reach

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.469 
probably put the game out of Spurs reach
you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.800> even<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.010> two<00:02:05.220> nil<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:06.150> goal<00:02:06.330> first

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you know even a two nil one goal first

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.900 
you know even a two nil one goal first
then<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.900> one<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.470> we<00:02:08.160> hanging<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
then to one and we hanging on then I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.400 
then to one and we hanging on then I
think<00:02:09.179> took<00:02:09.330> three<00:02:09.570> nos<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.080> thought<00:02:10.260> we

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
think took three nos and we thought we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.770 
think took three nos and we thought we
probably<00:02:10.619> won<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.100> change<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.360> proved

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
probably won that change so it proved

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.270 
probably won that change so it proved
oh<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.140> didn't<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.530> give<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> lodge<00:02:14.040> for

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
this test now I didn't the but it was

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.420 
this test now I didn't the but it was
given<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.200> me<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.560> gave<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> Phil<00:02:17.070> parks

tonight

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
tonight
this<00:02:31.260> must<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.620> course<00:02:31.800> give<00:02:32.040> yourself<00:02:32.459> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this must of course give yourself and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
this must of course give yourself and
the<00:02:32.820> team<00:02:33.000> tremendous<00:02:33.750> confidence<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.530> would

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the team tremendous confidence I would

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770 
the team tremendous confidence I would
think<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.010> Saturday<00:02:35.730> at<00:02:35.940> home<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.390> Brighton

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
think that Saturday at home to Brighton

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.699 
think that Saturday at home to Brighton
might<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.080> been<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> bit<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
might have been a bit of a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.440 
might have been a bit of a
disappointment<00:02:38.160> yes<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.239> think

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
disappointment yes it was and I think

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.820 
disappointment yes it was and I think
you're<00:02:39.600> right<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:39.840> needed<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.650> boost

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
you're right we needed the the boost

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
you're right we needed the the boost
that<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.100> given<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.400> us<00:02:41.610> then<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:42.870> haven't

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that is given to us then we haven't

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.620 
that is given to us then we haven't
played<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.440> first<00:02:43.590> division<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:44.250> three

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
played in the first division for three

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.330 
played in the first division for three
three<00:02:45.630> seasons<00:02:46.019> now<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.250> all

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
three seasons now so I think we all

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.830 
three seasons now so I think we all
needed<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> win<00:02:48.000> under<00:02:48.120> our<00:02:48.239> belts<00:02:48.660> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
needed to get a win under our belts and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.449 
needed to get a win under our belts and
it<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.410> very<00:02:49.560> satisfying<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:50.160> come<00:02:50.340> to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
it was very satisfying to come to

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.680 
it was very satisfying to come to
Tottenham<00:02:50.820> which<00:02:50.940> obviously<00:02:51.390> they're<00:02:51.540> our

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
Tottenham which obviously they're our

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.750 
Tottenham which obviously they're our
closest<00:02:52.050> rivals<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.280> means<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.489> lot<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.730> our

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
closest rivals so it means a lot to our

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.449 
closest rivals so it means a lot to our
fans<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.239> well<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:55.590> set<00:02:55.739> us<00:02:55.890> up<00:02:55.920> but

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
fans as well and it will set us up but

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.560 
fans as well and it will set us up but
you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.790> obviously<00:02:57.060> we've<00:02:57.209> got<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.360> look

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
you know obviously we've got to look

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.190 
you know obviously we've got to look
forward<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.050> something<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:59.280> known<00:03:00.200> start

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
forward to something going known start

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.020 
forward to something going known start
working<00:03:01.440> hard<00:03:01.620> again<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> try<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.310> try<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
working hard again and try and try and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
working hard again and try and try and
beat<00:03:03.180> them<00:03:03.330> form<00:03:03.570> him<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.470> you'd<00:03:04.680> have

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
beat them form him and you'd have

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.160 
beat them form him and you'd have
tremendous<00:03:05.220> Personals<00:03:05.730> record<00:03:06.600> scoring

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
tremendous Personals record scoring

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.310 
tremendous Personals record scoring
goals<00:03:07.320> left<00:03:07.709> season<00:03:08.310> no<00:03:08.840> well<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.080> could<00:03:10.110> have

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
goals left season no well you could have

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.780 
goals left season no well you could have
got<00:03:10.440> off<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> better<00:03:10.769> servant<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.489> do<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.700> all

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
got off to a better servant to do it all

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.940 
got off to a better servant to do it all
again<00:03:11.910> no<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.390> think<00:03:12.690> gold<00:03:12.989> score<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.410> very<00:03:13.500> a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
again no I think gold score is very a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.979 
again no I think gold score is very a
very<00:03:14.459> personal<00:03:14.880> thing<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.299> each

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
very personal thing and I each

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.460 
very personal thing and I each
goalscorer<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:18.209> any<00:03:18.690> side<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.170> probably

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
goalscorer in any side is probably

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.140 
goalscorer in any side is probably
different<00:03:19.830> character<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> rest<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
different character to the rest of the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.310 
different character to the rest of the
players<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> team<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.959> think<00:03:22.049> you've<00:03:22.230> got

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
players in the team I think you've got

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.860 
players in the team I think you've got
to<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.470> selfish<00:03:22.950> very<00:03:23.220> greedy<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.870> also

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to be very selfish very greedy and also

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
to be very selfish very greedy and also
very<00:03:25.019> confident<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.250> start<00:03:26.640> like

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
