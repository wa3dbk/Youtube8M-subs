00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:17.779
 Hello, today I want to show how 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:22.449
 a hyacinth flower is made from skin candy 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.460
 here we have a flower to start take 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.509
 we cut a strip along 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.540
 width should be this 10 centimeters and 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.540
 the length for such a meter is slightly larger 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:22.470
 the brain leaving does not reach to the edge 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:27.960
 about a centimeter developed stripes 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.009
 expanding learn now we take 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 a skewer or a skewer finished snails would 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.210
 into a straw 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.660
 turn these stripes here these here he 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:47.539
 back can get and the next one and so 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.539
 our whole ribbon is chopped 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.050
 how I ended it happened all the same he 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.150
 finished my cats turned out so 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.670
 tape 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.250
 sediments us tube and sticks 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.270
 fix the candy I'm for such a captive 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.170
 candy and asked bread with me sides 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.660
 bell with another scotch just 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.660
 will stop 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.629
 and in order to sweets so here not 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.530
 I hung out and finished well exactly 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.530
 food and fix 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.220
 here's a sweetie 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.940
 holds tight on a stick and now 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 proceed to the design of the very St. 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:15.970
 for this on the fly 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.530
 I will cover our drip glue and a little 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:25.599
 twirl tight 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:29.630
 on the shell with a candy and darts glue and 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:34.130
 and to his way further each layer 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.880
 a little bit of it going down a little bit 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.880
 stretch 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.540
 now I get such a goal now I will 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.140
 spinning all over the world inside the pate I'm 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.069
 already changed and approved two such leaves 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.480
 aspedistra 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:14.030
 there we are still waiting for defects 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:16.340
 we twist the clouds the flow now it is necessary 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.560
 raise chickens here we hear 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.560
 cooked inside you on a flock 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.560
 we insert 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.590
 and close the foam it using 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.590
 sweets just glue 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.530
 start with pro. 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.629
 and so here in place of the cavity tray 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.629
 such a flower was spinning 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.849
