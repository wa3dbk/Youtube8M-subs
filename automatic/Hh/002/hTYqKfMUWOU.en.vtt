00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:47.779 
up you get all these little glances so

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.420 
up you get all these little glances so
you<00:04:47.840> get<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.169> have<00:04:48.319> one<00:04:48.529> set<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:48.949> my<00:04:49.039> heart<00:04:49.279> rate

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430

so 69 and maybe since I'm talking to you
maybe<00:04:52.219> I'm<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.400> little<00:04:52.580> nervous<00:04:52.729> let's<00:04:53.120> see<00:04:53.210> if

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
maybe I'm a little nervous let's see if

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.510 
maybe I'm a little nervous let's see if
it<00:04:53.389> goes<00:04:53.509> up<00:04:53.719> a<00:04:53.810> little<00:04:53.960> bit<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:55.099> measures<00:04:55.460> your

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
it goes up a little bit it measures your

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.740 
it goes up a little bit it measures your
heart<00:04:55.819> rate<00:04:55.969> and<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:56.210> probably<00:04:56.389> takes<00:04:56.629> a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
heart rate and it probably takes a

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.330 
heart rate and it probably takes a
couple<00:04:56.900> seconds<00:04:57.349> here<00:04:57.560> let's<00:04:57.860> see<00:04:58.039> if<00:04:58.129> it<00:04:58.219> ever

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
couple seconds here let's see if it ever

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.709 
couple seconds here let's see if it ever
actually<00:04:58.909> does<00:04:59.360> it

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
actually does it

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.209 
actually does it
maybe<00:05:00.139> not<00:05:00.319> it'll<00:05:00.560> take<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.860> I'll<00:05:01.039> come<00:05:01.189> back

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
maybe not it'll take that I'll come back

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.499 
maybe not it'll take that I'll come back
to<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:02.060> here's<00:05:02.270> what<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.389> was<00:05:02.449> talking

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.019 
design of this watch so it is beautiful
it<00:06:05.810> feels<00:06:05.839> like<00:06:06.349> a<00:06:06.379> real<00:06:06.620> timepiece<00:06:07.129> so<00:06:07.819> far

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029 
it feels like a real timepiece so far

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.670 
it feels like a real timepiece so far
seems<00:06:08.389> like<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.629> batteries<00:06:09.020> lasting<00:06:09.439> longer

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
seems like the batteries lasting longer

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.379 
seems like the batteries lasting longer
than<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:10.009> Android<00:06:10.370> devices<00:06:10.699> I've<00:06:10.969> had<00:06:11.180> and

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
than the Android devices I've had and

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.409 
than the Android devices I've had and
it's<00:06:12.020> fun<00:06:12.319> the<00:06:12.649> apps<00:06:12.860> are<00:06:13.339> beautiful<00:06:14.029> they're

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
it's fun the apps are beautiful they're

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.850 
it's fun the apps are beautiful they're
an<00:06:14.539> extension<00:06:15.110> of<00:06:15.229> what<00:06:15.289> you<00:06:15.500> get<00:06:15.649> on<00:06:15.740> the

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
an extension of what you get on the

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.909 
an extension of what you get on the
iPhone<00:06:16.219> and<00:06:16.490> so<00:06:17.060> far<00:06:17.330> even<00:06:17.990> today<00:06:18.379> on<00:06:18.620> launch

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
iPhone and so far even today on launch

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.639 
iPhone and so far even today on launch
day<00:06:19.039> I'm<00:06:19.399> seeing<00:06:19.969> much<00:06:20.509> more<00:06:20.870> thoughtful<00:06:21.229> apps

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:21.649 
day I'm seeing much more thoughtful apps

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.189 
day I'm seeing much more thoughtful apps
better<00:06:22.310> apps<00:06:22.580> higher<00:06:22.969> quality<00:06:23.509> apps<00:06:23.689> on<00:06:23.960> the

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
better apps higher quality apps on the

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.139 
better apps higher quality apps on the
watch<00:06:24.379> than<00:06:24.979> I've<00:06:25.129> seen<00:06:25.159> on<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.639> Android

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:26.149 
watch than I've seen on the Android

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:27.969 
watch than I've seen on the Android
devices<00:06:26.479> so<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.050> think<00:06:27.439> that's<00:06:27.620> going<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.830> be<00:06:27.889> a

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
devices so I think that's going to be a

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.800 
devices so I think that's going to be a
big<00:06:28.189> difference<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:28.759> a<00:06:28.879> big<00:06:29.089> differentiator

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
big difference and a big differentiator

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.170 
big difference and a big differentiator
between<00:06:30.110> these<00:06:30.560> two<00:06:30.800> devices<00:06:30.969> when<00:06:31.969> you<00:06:32.029> talk

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
between these two devices when you talk

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.209 
between these two devices when you talk
about<00:06:32.209> Android<00:06:32.750> versus<00:06:33.259> iPhone<00:06:33.620> so<00:06:33.800> again

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
about Android versus iPhone so again

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.580 
about Android versus iPhone so again
final<00:06:35.060> thought<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:35.269> here<00:06:35.629> if<00:06:35.779> you<00:06:35.930> haven't<00:06:36.349> I

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
final thought on here if you haven't I

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.170 
final thought on here if you haven't I
