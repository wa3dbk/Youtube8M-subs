00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.260
 use your android smartphone in 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 quality of the microphone for showing either 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 microphone all we need is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 yusb because I will use usb 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.070
 instead of wi-fi and also we will need 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.680
 a program called music 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.320
 a client that you can safely 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.920
 download from the play market and of course I 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.110
 I will give you links to it as it is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.360
 looks like we are about to music 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 I demonstrate on samsung galaxy light 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 everything here is a familiar design from 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 settings here you can configure the ports 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.620
 for for Wi fi can be set here 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 and the choice of yusbi wi-fi or bluetooth by 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.629
 Wi-Fi all just connect to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.289
 to a certain 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.800
 to the server there ah pi will be given 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.769
 I'm afraid even easier Stalin firewood leave 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 clients run all you can download 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.510
 under the video if you click the expand button 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.820
 so we press start now we need 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.659
 connect our smartphone to us 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.040
 I'll do it now 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.750
 the main thing that you had exposed 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.020
 set to select debug mode by usb 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.430
 in which you can find in the settings 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.360
 most likely in development, depending on who 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 what firmware so i stick 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.990
 here you can even here as we see it right now 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990
 write esbe connected 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.829
 here's how we see yusbi connected all 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.250
 the green microphone lights up then you can 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.340
 go to customers through my windows 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.210
 he is here because i use him in 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.250
 microphone quality as default everything 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.630
 so small to clients 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.539
 need full screen 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.269
 to make it easier to see here 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.340
 the standard settings are not even 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.100
 settings so here here is optimus so 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 I will put up right now 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 play speech to say what you hear 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.560
 here you can click here here port if 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.360
 we will set the ports then 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.950
 connect combat file here connect 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.640
 here we can choose 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.220

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.360

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.349

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.489
 say so hear me now wait 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:58.810
 please set it very audible 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:06.040
 beautiful super easy to hear to speak 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.640
 and allow hear me so try 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.850
 sometimes such lags occur 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.940
 this program, but it is also due to the fact 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.350
 that I am a weak smartphone just because of this 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.900
 lag occurs 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.630
 and so everything works great often new 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.010
 in the new Rob prikonnektitsya 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.319

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:41.310

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.040
 try not to tell the camera to lean 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.950
 I can hear the dynamics all as we see the sound 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.739
 goes fine check sound ri bags 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:57.549
 everything can calmly roll this 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:58.959
 program so turn off immediately say 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.479
 I have to focus 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.630
 automatically because i'm filming 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:07.859

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.150
 I â€™m recording my sound in the settings 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:15.010

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.500
 apologizing not a mixer and friday so 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.509
 recording devices through immediately 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.419
 speak through a recording device we 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.979
 we can adjust our microphone and all 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.410
 something is not attached here try not 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.130
 say with speak speak as we see 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.389
 sound waves appear now also 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.330
 Skopje is defined as 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.600
 let's try an additional device 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.600
 tune 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:47.710
 so the settings are the sound settings 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.240
 as we see i tell them says if you 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.120
 let me prove to you now try 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:05:00.540
 call and be heard normally or 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.540
 no all try it goes record goes sound 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:16.220
 I hear well all thanks to all 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.110
 Basically you can hear this microphone 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.320
 can be used anywhere as notes 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.080
 With a game of video from the screen through let's say not 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.070
 I know how not forgotten called fraps 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.220
 either just to talk VKontakte than 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.350
 This is a normal substitute sound 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.170
 everything is fine 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.460
 whether it disconnect disconnects and ours 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.550
 a red microphone appears on the microphone 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.160
 all can safely turn off what is not 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.770
 there will be all you need to download it 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.050
 the client himself put on the computer then 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.060
 you need to download the client on android 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.630
 then go to their unofficial site 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.820
 download 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.790
 if you have everything written there 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.040
 you 84 bit system you will 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.460
 you need to download firewood for it 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.980
 if you have a 64-bit system 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.950
 you do n't need my firewood 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.140
 deny it is not a 32-bit system 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.380
 so I downloaded installed firewood and all 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.880
 works great when installing this 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.410
 client you have a computer is possible 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.450
 reboot a couple of times on not 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.930
 worry it will happen fast it 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.110
