way to play Pachelbel's Canon in see
using<00:00:54.630> triads<00:00:55.790> we're<00:00:56.790> simply<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> use

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
using triads we're simply going to use

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.070 
using triads we're simply going to use
major<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.470> minor<00:00:59.040> triads<00:00:59.580> on<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.910> piano<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
major and minor triads on the piano to

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.189 
major and minor triads on the piano to
get<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> song<00:01:01.710> played<00:01:02.900> we're<00:01:03.900> going<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
get the song played we're going to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.620 
get the song played we're going to
accomplish<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.489> playing<00:01:05.880> major<00:01:06.300> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
accomplish this by playing major and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
accomplish this by playing major and
minor<00:01:06.930> triads<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.390> starting<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
minor triads in this way starting with a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.440 
minor triads in this way starting with a
c<00:01:09.869> major<00:01:10.080> triad<00:01:10.580> c<00:01:11.580> e<00:01:12.380> g<00:01:13.460> c<00:01:14.460> e<00:01:14.869> g<00:01:15.890> e<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.119> back<00:01:18.300> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
c major triad c e g c e g e and back to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.430 
c major triad c e g c e g e and back to
C<00:01:19.399> so<00:01:20.399> with<00:01:20.550> each<00:01:20.820> triad<00:01:21.240> we'll<00:01:21.840> play<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
C so with each triad we'll play it this

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.110 
C so with each triad we'll play it this
way

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.420 

and<00:01:29.170> we'll<00:01:30.170> move<00:01:30.410> through<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.980> Triads

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
and we'll move through the Triads

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.210 
and we'll move through the Triads
playing<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.000> in<00:01:32.120> that<00:01:32.270> way<00:01:32.710> or<00:01:33.710> start<00:01:34.010> with<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
playing it in that way or start with the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:44.530 
playing it in that way or start with the
C<00:01:34.400> major<00:01:34.580> triad<00:01:34.850> which<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.450> c<00:01:35.690> e<00:01:36.340> G<00:01:43.330> then<00:01:44.330> we'll

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
C major triad which is c e G then we'll

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.830 
C major triad which is c e G then we'll
move<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:45.050> G<00:01:45.350> major<00:01:45.590> triad<00:01:45.820> which<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.000> G<00:01:47.330> B<00:01:48.170> D

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
move to a G major triad which is G B D

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.430 
move to a G major triad which is G B D
and<00:01:50.950> as<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.100> can<00:01:52.280> see<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:53.270> do<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> same<00:01:53.870> exact

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
and as you can see we do the same exact

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.800 
and as you can see we do the same exact
thing<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.710> was<00:01:55.100> G<00:01:55.460> B<00:01:56.150> D<00:01:56.660> G<00:01:57.410> B<00:01:58.390> B<00:01:59.390> big<00:02:00.230> G<00:02:01.810> then

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
thing that was G B D G B B big G then

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.419 
thing that was G B D G B B big G then
we'll<00:02:03.050> move<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.440> minor<00:02:03.920> which<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.990> c<00:02:05.990> e<00:02:06.790> b<00:02:07.820> c

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
we'll move to a minor which is a c e b c

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:20.690 
we'll move to a minor which is a c e b c
b:c<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:13.580> back<00:02:13.880> down<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.510> E<00:02:14.540> minor

me f and finish up with G G B D G B be
they<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.860> our<00:03:09.040> triads<00:03:09.610> were<00:03:09.850> C<00:03:12.120> G<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:15.030> minor

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
they and so our triads were C G a minor

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:34.120 
they and so our triads were C G a minor
a<00:03:18.040> minor<00:03:20.590> F<00:03:23.350> let's<00:03:24.350> see<00:03:26.230> F<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:30.080> G<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:33.130> let's

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
a minor F let's see F and G so let's

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:52.260 
a minor F let's see F and G so let's
play<00:03:34.340> through<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.640> whole<00:03:34.850> thing

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:12.940 

you

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.210 

and<00:04:14.140> once<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.319> work<00:04:15.560> through<00:04:15.800> that<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.980> few

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and once you work through that a few

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.970 
and once you work through that a few
times<00:04:16.630> you'll<00:04:17.630> pick<00:04:17.840> up<00:04:18.019> speed<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:18.799> just

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
times you'll pick up speed and it just

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.670 
times you'll pick up speed and it just
sounds<00:04:19.250> something<00:04:19.430> like<00:04:19.549> this

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520 

you

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:36.470 

you

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.600 

you

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.010 

now<00:04:43.610> after<00:04:43.999> you've<00:04:44.149> played<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.539> a<00:04:44.629> few<00:04:44.839> times

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
now after you've played it a few times

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.839 
now after you've played it a few times
you<00:04:45.409> probably<00:04:45.889> want<00:04:46.099> to<00:04:46.159> add<00:04:46.219> a<00:04:46.339> little<00:04:46.550> spice

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
you probably want to add a little spice

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.129 
you probably want to add a little spice
to<00:04:46.909> it<00:04:47.179> by<00:04:47.689> adding<00:04:47.929> a<00:04:48.379> major<00:04:49.309> scale<00:04:50.139> descending

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
to it by adding a major scale descending

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:58.029 
to it by adding a major scale descending
to<00:04:51.499> the<00:04:51.529> end<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.949> it<00:04:52.039> like<00:04:52.069> this<00:04:55.149> and<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.860> was

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
to the end of it like this and that was

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.309 
to the end of it like this and that was
played<00:04:58.369> by<00:04:58.580> going<00:04:58.969> to<00:04:59.149> fingers<00:04:59.479> 5<00:04:59.959> 4<00:05:00.649> 3<00:05:01.309> 2<00:05:02.089> 1<00:05:03.019> and

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
played by going to fingers 5 4 3 2 1 and

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:15.180 
played by going to fingers 5 4 3 2 1 and
then<00:05:04.479> taking<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.689> middle<00:05:05.959> finger<00:05:06.409> 3<00:05:07.219> 2

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.590 

let's<00:05:16.190> put<00:05:16.400> that<00:05:16.550> on<00:05:16.699> the<00:05:16.819> end<00:05:16.970> of<00:05:17.180> it

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:39.060 

you

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.890 

you<00:05:40.070> may<00:05:40.250> have<00:05:40.430> noticed<00:05:40.670> that<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.270> held<00:05:41.660> down

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
you may have noticed that I held down

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.610 
you may have noticed that I held down
the<00:05:42.200> G<00:05:42.920> chord<00:05:43.160> G<00:05:43.670> B<00:05:43.880> D<00:05:43.910> on<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.630> left<00:05:44.870> as<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.380> play

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
the G chord G B D on the left as I play

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:58.290
