00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.780
 the Philharmonic Orchestra of Bogota 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
 presents the city of the general to 25 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.320
 new artists that today make up the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.330
 youthful philharmonic band of winds 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.680
 created for the strengthening and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.680
 dissemination of symphonic music 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.310
 the creation of the philharmonic band 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.840
 a selection process arises in which 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.610
 musicians were chosen from several 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.590
 regions of the country what has meant 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.480
 for some of them not just one 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.480
 opportunity but a change of life 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.670
 it does not come with an instrument of my 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.870
 professor of the university that I admire 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.489
 but it's all 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.940
 I came to play to Bogota and my 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.940
 work 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 the case of cristian lion musician of the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 university and antioquia is one of the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.910
 more emblematic because for the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 belonging to the philharmonic band is not 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.790
 only a professional challenge but a great 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.380
 life challenge 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 I had everything in my family work 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.070
 many things but you have to follow the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 dreams because 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 that we are still young and because 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.790
 you have to narrow and design 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.790
 obviously

 little known in popular music 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.990
 will show children another path that is 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.000
 by profession another profession that if 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.399
 it may not be true that it is not 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.399
 die of hunger as many people believe

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.870
 opportunity that musicians have 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.150
 find a space to put in 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.940
 practice their knowledge in many of 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 the musicians who graduate and there is not in 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.310
 where to work then then it's super 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.950
 lucky they open all these spaces 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.360
 so that one should perhaps leave the country 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.360
