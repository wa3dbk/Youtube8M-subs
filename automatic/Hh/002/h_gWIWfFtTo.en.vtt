taking<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.190> speed<00:00:17.610> typing<00:00:17.940> test<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.110> go

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.660 

now<00:00:32.430> I've<00:00:32.789> become<00:00:33.770> used<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> typing<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
now I've become used to typing on the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
now I've become used to typing on the
tech<00:00:35.879> so<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:37.019> making<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.499> lot<00:00:37.679> of<00:00:37.710> mistakes

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
tech so I'm making a lot of mistakes

00:00:38.670 --> 00:01:20.249 
tech so I'm making a lot of mistakes
here<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.809> wouldn't<00:00:40.199> normally<00:00:40.469> make

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.560 

so<00:01:21.259> that<00:01:21.950> was<00:01:22.100> pretty<00:01:22.280> bad<00:01:22.520> because<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.509> just

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
so that was pretty bad because I just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.330 
so that was pretty bad because I just
switched<00:01:23.960> from<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.500> tech<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.130> keyboard

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
switched from the tech to this keyboard

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.630 
switched from the tech to this keyboard
without<00:01:25.729> warming<00:01:26.390> up<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.780> got<00:01:27.470> 49<00:01:27.920> words<00:01:28.369> per

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
without warming up I got 49 words per

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.560 
without warming up I got 49 words per
minute<00:01:28.850> made<00:01:29.390> seven<00:01:29.840> errors<00:01:30.280> so<00:01:31.360> that's<00:01:32.360> the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
minute made seven errors so that's the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.810 
minute made seven errors so that's the
rosewill<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.830> can<00:01:34.039> kind<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.280> get<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.429> feel<00:01:34.640> for

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
rosewill you can kind of get a feel for

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.609 
rosewill you can kind of get a feel for
how<00:01:34.940> your<00:01:35.090> fingers<00:01:35.360> move<00:01:35.570> around<00:01:35.780> on<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.170> now

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
how your fingers move around on it now

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.060 
how your fingers move around on it now
I'm<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.920> switch<00:01:37.100> over<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.610> tech

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
I'm going to switch over to the tech

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.410 
I'm going to switch over to the tech
right<00:01:40.070> away<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.399> see<00:01:40.670> this<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> smaller

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
right away you can see this is a smaller

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.169 
right away you can see this is a smaller
keyboard<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:42.170> terms<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.740> wit<00:01:42.950> let<00:01:43.250> me<00:01:43.369> just

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
keyboard in terms of wit let me just

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.560 
keyboard in terms of wit let me just
show<00:01:45.130> you've<00:01:46.130> lost<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.520> number<00:01:46.789> keypad<00:01:47.210> but

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
show you've lost the number keypad but

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.320 
show you've lost the number keypad but
you<00:01:47.690> also<00:01:47.840> gain<00:01:48.200> some<00:01:48.500> height<00:01:48.890> with<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.490> with

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
you also gain some height with the with

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.270 
you also gain some height with the with
the<00:01:50.360> palm<00:01:50.659> race<00:01:50.899> here<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> arrangement

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the palm race here but the arrangement

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.710 
the palm race here but the arrangement
of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.369> keys<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.640> quite<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> bit<00:01:53.240> different<00:01:53.270> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
of the keys is quite a bit different and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.410 
of the keys is quite a bit different and
I<00:01:54.560> become<00:01:55.130> rather<00:01:55.310> used<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.759> typing<00:01:55.970> with<00:01:56.240> this

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
I become rather used to typing with this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.190 
I become rather used to typing with this
so<00:01:56.659> I'm<00:01:56.929> going<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.110> do<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.350> same<00:01:57.409> test<00:01:57.979> again

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:53.070 

let<00:02:03.200> me<00:02:03.759> restart<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.850> here<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.270> go

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:09.130 

I'll<00:02:54.080> worry<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.680> later<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.840> one

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
I'll worry about that later so that one

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.770 
I'll worry about that later so that one
would<00:03:09.799> with<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.549> tech<00:03:10.760> keyboard<00:03:11.180> I'm<00:03:11.390> having

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
would with the tech keyboard I'm having

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.350 
would with the tech keyboard I'm having
at<00:03:12.019> 71<00:03:12.530> words<00:03:12.739> per<00:03:12.950> minute<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:14.030> didn't<00:03:14.299> make

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
at 71 words per minute and I didn't make

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.570 
at 71 words per minute and I didn't make
any<00:03:14.569> errors<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.440> part<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:15.980> that's<00:03:16.099> just<00:03:16.400> kind

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
any errors but part of that's just kind

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.210 
any errors but part of that's just kind
of<00:03:16.640> luck<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.060> draw<00:03:17.209> anyway<00:03:18.110> hopefully<00:03:19.040> you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
of luck of the draw anyway hopefully you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.620 
of luck of the draw anyway hopefully you
can<00:03:19.370> see<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.819> fingers<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.390> hands

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
can see that the fingers in the hands

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.570 
can see that the fingers in the hands
tend<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.620> move<00:03:21.799> or<00:03:22.190> stretch

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
tend to not have to move or stretch

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.059 
tend to not have to move or stretch
nearly<00:03:22.880> as<00:03:23.060> far<00:03:23.330> because<00:03:23.780> of<00:03:24.049> the<00:03:24.200> orthogonal

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
nearly as far because of the orthogonal

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.759 
nearly as far because of the orthogonal
layout<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.849> keys<00:03:26.120> here<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:26.630> again<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.650> is

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
layout of the keys here so again this is

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.009 
layout of the keys here so again this is
