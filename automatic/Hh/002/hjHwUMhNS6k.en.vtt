okay this is just a quick video the show
we<00:00:06.279> got<00:00:06.400> a<00:00:06.460> 15<00:00:07.089> watt<00:00:07.440> solar<00:00:08.440> panel<00:00:08.610> that's<00:00:09.610> an

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:09.759 
we got a 15 watt solar panel that's an

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.379 
we got a 15 watt solar panel that's an
amorphous<00:00:10.089> solar<00:00:10.929> panel<00:00:11.469> I<00:00:12.309> did<00:00:12.879> not<00:00:13.030> get<00:00:13.209> that

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
amorphous solar panel I did not get that

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.430 
amorphous solar panel I did not get that
from<00:00:13.659> Harbor<00:00:14.409> Freight<00:00:15.510> but<00:00:16.510> it's<00:00:16.690> identical

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
from Harbor Freight but it's identical

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.990 
from Harbor Freight but it's identical
to<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.770> ones<00:00:17.950> you<00:00:18.100> buy<00:00:18.250> at<00:00:18.400> Harbor<00:00:18.700> Freight

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
to the ones you buy at Harbor Freight

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.180 
to the ones you buy at Harbor Freight
and<00:00:19.480> its<00:00:20.380> amorphous<00:00:20.680> again<00:00:21.250> it's<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.090> 15<00:00:22.510> watt

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
and its amorphous again it's a 15 watt

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.340 
and its amorphous again it's a 15 watt
panel<00:00:24.630> okay<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.930> it's<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.780> does<00:00:29.050> really

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350

only about nine o'clock in the morning
here<00:01:07.030> on<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> Sunday<00:01:07.840> morning<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:11.320> doesn't

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
here on a Sunday morning and it doesn't

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.110 
here on a Sunday morning and it doesn't
seem<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.800> have<00:01:11.950> any<00:01:12.160> trouble<00:01:12.310> at<00:01:12.580> all<00:01:12.670> running

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
seem to have any trouble at all running

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.800 
seem to have any trouble at all running
this<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:14.040> netbook<00:01:15.510> so<00:01:16.510> I<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:17.050> guess<00:01:17.530> some<00:01:18.690> if<00:01:19.690> I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
this this netbook so I I guess some if I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.900 
this this netbook so I I guess some if I
was<00:01:19.960> going<00:01:20.200> camping<00:01:20.470> or<00:01:20.830> something<00:01:20.860> it'd<00:01:21.700> be<00:01:21.880> a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
was going camping or something it'd be a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.630 
was going camping or something it'd be a
good<00:01:22.030> idea<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.450> take<00:01:22.660> one<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:22.990> these<00:01:23.080> with<00:01:23.350> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
good idea to take one of these with you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.870 
good idea to take one of these with you
although<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> 15<00:01:26.020> watt<00:01:26.200> panel<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:26.880> seems

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
although for a 15 watt panel it's seems

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.660 
although for a 15 watt panel it's seems
like<00:01:27.940> it's<00:01:28.180> pretty<00:01:28.840> long<00:01:29.230> pretty<00:01:29.950> large<00:01:30.280> but

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
like it's pretty long pretty large but

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.100 
like it's pretty long pretty large but
then<00:01:31.330> again<00:01:31.480> I<00:01:31.870> guess<00:01:32.170> as<00:01:32.650> a<00:01:32.680> power<00:01:32.980> source<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
then again I guess as a power source it

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.870 
then again I guess as a power source it
might<00:01:35.380> not<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.740> too<00:01:35.920> bad<00:01:36.130> considering<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
might not be too bad considering that

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.540 
might not be too bad considering that
doesn't<00:01:37.330> make<00:01:37.420> any<00:01:37.570> noise<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
doesn't make any noise and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.340 
doesn't make any noise and
doesn't<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.420> any<00:01:40.570> pollution<00:01:41.080> or<00:01:41.200> anything

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
doesn't have any pollution or anything

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.120 
doesn't have any pollution or anything
like<00:01:41.560> that

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
like that

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.200 
like that
you're<00:01:42.550> not<00:01:42.640> gonna<00:01:42.790> disturb<00:01:43.270> anyone<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:46.090> it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
you're not gonna disturb anyone but it

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.530 
you're not gonna disturb anyone but it
should<00:01:46.450> pretty<00:01:46.750> much<00:01:46.840> run<00:01:47.230> all<00:01:47.410> of<00:01:47.440> your

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
should pretty much run all of your

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.220 
should pretty much run all of your
electronics<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.660> get<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> little<00:01:50.020> netbook

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
electronics you get a little netbook

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.510 
electronics you get a little netbook
like<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:50.980> like<00:01:51.370> this<00:01:51.490> little<00:01:51.700> Acer<00:01:53.520> I'm

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
tried it on my wife's Acer Aspire one

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.600 
tried it on my wife's Acer Aspire one
and<00:02:01.480> it<00:02:01.540> works<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:02.620> as<00:02:02.830> well<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.400> one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and it works just as well on that one

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
and it works just as well on that one
but<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.330> can<00:02:04.510> see<00:02:04.690> again<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.640> green<00:02:06.910> light

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
but you can see again the green light

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.620 
but you can see again the green light
it's<00:02:08.350> charging<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.010> battery<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:12.420> yeah<00:02:13.420> it

it's charging the battery and yeah it
pretty<00:02:13.840> much<00:02:14.080> would<00:02:14.290> run<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> as<00:02:14.920> long<00:02:15.100> as<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
pretty much would run it as long as the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.150 
pretty much would run it as long as the
Sun<00:02:15.780> sun<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.870> shining<00:02:17.260> anyway<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.740> would<00:02:17.860> keep

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
Sun sun is shining anyway it would keep

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.850 
Sun sun is shining anyway it would keep
the<00:02:18.220> battery<00:02:18.640> charged<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.560> being<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
the battery charged but being that it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.970 
the battery charged but being that it
can<00:02:21.040> run<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:22.390> laptop<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.380> should<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.800> no

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
can run the the laptop it should have no

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.380 
can run the the laptop it should have no
trouble<00:02:24.420> charging<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:26.140> mp3<00:02:26.530> players<00:02:27.070> or

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
trouble charging like mp3 players or

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.010 
trouble charging like mp3 players or
anything<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:31.660> did<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> little

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
anything like that we did a little

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.390 
anything like that we did a little
experiment<00:02:32.350> earlier<00:02:32.920> where<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
experiment earlier where we have a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.360 
experiment earlier where we have a
charge<00:02:33.790> controller<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
charge controller here this is just a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
charge controller here this is just a
12-volt<00:02:37.240> charge<00:02:37.780> controller<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.690> hook

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
12-volt charge controller and you hook

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.630 
12-volt charge controller and you hook
up<00:02:41.020> your<00:02:41.050> panel<00:02:41.620> show<00:02:41.980> us<00:02:42.100> how<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.250> cook<00:02:42.490> up

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
up your panel show us how you cook up

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.910 
up your panel show us how you cook up
your<00:02:42.670> solar<00:02:43.209> panel<00:02:43.600> your<00:02:44.110> battery<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.800> then

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
your solar panel your battery and then

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.479 
your solar panel your battery and then
your<00:02:45.070> load<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:47.410> 12-volt<00:02:47.860> battery<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.280> just

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
your load and for 12-volt battery I just

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.710 
your load and for 12-volt battery I just
use<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.989> double-a<00:02:50.250> rechargeables<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:52.570> you

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
use the double-a rechargeables that you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600 
use the double-a rechargeables that you
can<00:02:52.840> buy<00:02:52.989> anywhere<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.500> bed<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> Radio<00:02:54.040> Shack<00:02:54.340> or

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
can buy anywhere in bed a Radio Shack or

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.259 
can buy anywhere in bed a Radio Shack or
whatever<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:56.400> yeah<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.610> doesn't<00:02:58.030> seem<00:02:58.180> to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
whatever and yeah it doesn't seem to

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.250 
whatever and yeah it doesn't seem to
have<00:02:58.330> any<00:02:58.510> trouble<00:02:58.840> at<00:02:58.930> all

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
have any trouble at all

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.699 
have any trouble at all
keeping<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.070> charged<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.680> course

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
keeping that charged and then of course

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.229 
keeping that charged and then of course
you<00:03:02.950> could<00:03:03.100> run<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:03.489> um<00:03:04.530> your<00:03:05.530> connectors

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
you could run your um your connectors

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.410 
you could run your um your connectors
out<00:03:07.239> from<00:03:07.720> your<00:03:07.870> load<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.970> say<00:03:09.970> an<00:03:10.060> iPod

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
out from your load to like say an iPod

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.770 
out from your load to like say an iPod
charger<00:03:10.450> or<00:03:11.110> something<00:03:11.440> like<00:03:11.560> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
charger or something like that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.170 
charger or something like that
but<00:03:12.990> um<00:03:13.200> yeah<00:03:14.100> that's<00:03:14.310> kind<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.640> neat<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.090> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
but um yeah that's kind of neat like I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.570 
but um yeah that's kind of neat like I
said<00:03:15.390> today's<00:03:16.460> pretty<00:03:17.460> cloudy<00:03:19.400> there's<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.550> a

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
said today's pretty cloudy there's not a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.950 
said today's pretty cloudy there's not a
whole<00:03:20.820> lot<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.060> Sun<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.600> again<00:03:21.720> it's

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
whole lot of Sun but then again it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.830 
whole lot of Sun but then again it's
bright<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.320> early<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> morning<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.840> it's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
bright and early in the morning and it's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.710 
bright and early in the morning and it's
pretty<00:03:25.110> neat<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.590> able<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.950> run<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
pretty neat that it's able to run a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.780 
pretty neat that it's able to run a
little<00:03:27.720> netbook<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:31.250> think<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> may<00:03:32.490> run

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
little netbook and I think it may run

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.699 
little netbook and I think it may run
the<00:03:32.940> full-size<00:03:33.390> laptops<00:03:34.110> are<00:03:34.350> eight<00:03:34.500> as<00:03:34.680> well

the full-size laptops are eight as well

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.270 
the full-size laptops are eight as well
but<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:36.230> don't<00:03:37.230> know<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:37.709> run<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.130> as

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
but I don't know that it would run it as

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.610 
but I don't know that it would run it as
well<00:03:39.000> maybe<00:03:39.270> because<00:03:39.510> again<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.290> only<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
well maybe because again that's only a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.390 
well maybe because again that's only a
15<00:03:40.830> watt<00:03:41.340> panel<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.650> anyway<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.130> a

15 watt panel and so but anyway just a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.050 
15 watt panel and so but anyway just a
little<00:03:47.610> quick<00:03:48.120> video<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.730> guys<00:03:50.880> can

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
little quick video and so you guys can

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.020 
little quick video and so you guys can
see<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.330> running<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:53.040> Google<00:03:53.430> homepage

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
probably wouldn't be able to run it real

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.240 
probably wouldn't be able to run it real
long<00:04:29.140> being<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.260> it's<00:04:30.380> only<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.650> 15<00:04:31.070> watt

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250
