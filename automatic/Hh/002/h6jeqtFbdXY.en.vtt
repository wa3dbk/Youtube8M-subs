00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.630
 Welcome to the new tutorial of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.160
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.160
 make a garland 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.740
 and materials that we're going to need a 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.010
 paper plate of different colors 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.400
 scissors glue on bar thread 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:36.610
 marker and an account let's start 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.280
 let's take the two sheets together and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.330
 let's mark on the white side a 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.330
 circle with a plate 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.210
 once this is done we will cut it 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.130
 now we are going to fold in the middle the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.130
 two sheets together in this way 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 then again in the middle 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 and a third time 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.850
 now with the highlighter I'm going to show you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.520
 what we are going to cut back we are going to do 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.370
 lines from one side to the other without reaching 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.950
 on the other side we stop a centimeter 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.240
 it increased first from one side of the triangle 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 and then the other 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 now let's use the scissors and let's go 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.900
 to cut over the lines you have to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.900
 take care not to cut to the end 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.640
 Once this is done we will return to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.640
 open 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.960
 carefully so that they do not break 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.960
 parts 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.930
 and once opened until the end we're going to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.930
 separate the leaves 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.299
 now we take the thread and the trinket and what 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.799
 we're going to tie up because at one extreme it's going to 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.260
 be the trinket and in our extremes 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.030
 simply from the thread we make a small 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.989
 hole in one of the round parts 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.220
 that we cut and we're going to pass the thread 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.370
 leaving the trinket in the part of 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.370
 in 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.680
 once this is done we put glue 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.870
 in the eight corners left eight 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.210
 doubles marks 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.340
 and we are going to adhere the second paper on 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.340
 we try to match the lines 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.150
 now we are going to let it dry 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.400
 and once dry 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.400
 we will be able to open our ireland 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.780
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.780

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.739
