00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.410 

I'm<00:02:08.069> showing<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.489> how<00:02:08.640> long<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> really

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I'm showing you how long this really

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.860 
I'm showing you how long this really
goes<00:02:10.970> seriously<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> lava<00:02:12.390> pit<00:02:12.629> there

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
goes seriously there's a lava pit there

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.729 
goes seriously there's a lava pit there
and<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.110> goes<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.560> probably<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:15.230> two<00:02:16.230> more

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
and it goes on probably for two more

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.720 
and it goes on probably for two more
screens<00:02:17.220> from<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:18.379> so<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.040> don't<00:02:20.069> want

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

screens from there so if you don't want
to<00:02:20.790> deal<00:02:20.970> with<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.480> follow<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to deal with this and you follow the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.100 
to deal with this and you follow the
path<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.230> I've<00:02:22.349> shown<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.430> far

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
path that I've shown you so far

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.600 
path that I've shown you so far
bust<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.500> your<00:02:25.709> items<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.489> can

bust out one of your items and you can
totally<00:02:26.849> bypass<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.049> mean<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.620> why<00:02:28.769> I

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
totally bypass this I mean that's why I

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.630 
totally bypass this I mean that's why I
did<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.099> just<00:02:29.400> whatever<00:02:31.160> number<00:02:32.160> two<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> think

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
did I just whatever number two I think

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.600 
did I just whatever number two I think
it<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.150> yes

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it is yes

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.250 
it is yes
make<00:02:36.150> sure<00:02:36.300> has<00:02:36.450> enough<00:02:36.690> energy<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.080> get

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
make sure has enough energy to get

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.870 
make sure has enough energy to get
across<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.590> look<00:02:37.740> how<00:02:38.280> much<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.730> would<00:02:38.850> have

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
across and look how much you would have

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.190 
across and look how much you would have
to<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:39.210> across<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
to get across like you can it's not that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.770 
to get across like you can it's not that
hard<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> lot<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.210> trial<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.630> error

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
hard but it's a lot of trial and error

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.970 
hard but it's a lot of trial and error
to<00:02:45.990> get<00:02:46.200> through<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.280> using<00:02:47.640> number<00:02:47.880> two

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
to get through that but using number two

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
to get through that but using number two
I'm<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.390> tried<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.660> he'll

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
I'm you see that I just tried like he'll

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
I'm you see that I just tried like he'll
go<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.950> robot<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.370> him<00:02:54.860> yeah<00:02:55.860> that's<00:02:56.070> gonna

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
go the robot with him yeah that's gonna

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
go the robot with him yeah that's gonna
do<00:02:56.370> something<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:58.410> yeah<00:02:58.790> issues<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.970> number

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
do something but yeah issues that number

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.850 
do something but yeah issues that number
two<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.630> across<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.080> law<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.710> makes

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
two to get across that law it just makes

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.760 
two to get across that law it just makes
it<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.040> he's<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.760> much<00:03:02.910> easier<00:03:03.380> now<00:03:04.380> heat

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
it that he's that much easier now heat

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.000 
it that he's that much easier now heat
man<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.480> extremely<00:03:06.480> weak<00:03:06.930> against<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> bubble

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
man is extremely weak against the bubble

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.910 
man is extremely weak against the bubble
ed<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.730> or<00:03:09.120> he's<00:03:09.630> he<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.440> doesn't<00:03:10.680> stand<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
ed so or he's he just doesn't stand a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.330 
ed so or he's he just doesn't stand a
chance

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
chance

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.510 
chance
so<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.730> bust<00:03:12.150> out<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.450> bubble<00:03:12.780> lead<00:03:13.520> shoot

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
so just bust out the bubble lead shoot

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.160 
so just bust out the bubble lead shoot
him<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:14.940> he's<00:03:15.420> gonna<00:03:15.540> turn<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:16.020> a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
him and then he's gonna turn into a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.560 
him and then he's gonna turn into a
flame<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.130> jump<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:17.730> him<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.180> that's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
flame and you jump over him and that's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.470 
flame and you jump over him and that's
pretty<00:03:18.780> much<00:03:18.900> his<00:03:19.140> pattern<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:21.240> every<00:03:21.390> time

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
pretty much his pattern so every time

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.850 
pretty much his pattern so every time
you<00:03:21.600> hit<00:03:21.780> him<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.140> bubble<00:03:22.440> head<00:03:22.560> he'll

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
you hit him with the bubble head he'll

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.040 
you hit him with the bubble head he'll
turn<00:03:23.250> into<00:03:23.490> this<00:03:23.580> long<00:03:23.850> flame<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.630> come<00:03:24.930> at

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
turn into this long flame and come at

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.860 
turn into this long flame and come at
you<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.550> at<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.240> point<00:03:27.570> you're

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
you and it's that at that point you're

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.200 
you and it's that at that point you're
gonna<00:03:27.960> jump<00:03:28.320> over<00:03:28.440> him<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:28.970> continue<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
gonna jump over him and continue the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.340 
gonna jump over him and continue the
cycle<00:03:30.390> until<00:03:30.750> he's<00:03:31.020> dead

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
cycle until he's dead

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.790 
cycle until he's dead
and<00:03:32.280> that's<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.270> he<00:03:33.510> man<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.930> dead<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.470> if

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
and that's that he man is dead and if

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800 
and that's that he man is dead and if
you<00:03:34.860> follow<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.280> path<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:35.730> far<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:36.180> are<00:03:36.300> off<00:03:36.450> to
