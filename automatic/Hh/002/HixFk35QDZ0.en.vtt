00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello hello here we are going to make today a 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.670
 dog blouse always our 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.520
 perlite yes yes yes 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.720
 this is a small blouse in the girl's 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.720
 about three years 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.210
 you have to be careful the seams that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.900
 are good to cut by the part of 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.130
 back of the back 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.559
 very carefully that they are not given 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.699
 so now we cut this is the part 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.489
 of the back that we forget most 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.520
 depending on how the pearlite is and what 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.020
 big of stature 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.020
 when now 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.539
 let's open it 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.510
 and we will cut about 5 centimeters 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.180
 centimeters more 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.079
 on each side and what are we going to do 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.330
 to reduce a little the width of the blouse 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.330
 that looks around more or less 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.530
 about five centimeters 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.560
 56 out there that our office is so 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 fat if it's better if it 's thin 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 it's on this same fabric it's not going to serve 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.190
 for the other side as a kind of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190
 dead 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.200
 we are doing for the decorations 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.280
 they have become perfect again 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.280
 let's hope so 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.220
 and we are going to put some pins 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.480
 and what is it for to be able to give us more 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480
 ease to sew 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.310
 without clicking 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.310
 a pair of pins 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 other 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 and so the party today 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.200
 more or less a few centimeters and in the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.870
 tights 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.210
 you do not have to do anything not the sleeves already 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.520
 they are made after passing this 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.190
 Straight stitching 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.190
 it's better to have a zigzag 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.570
 what is that for, I hope 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.570
 sure this position 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.430
 for that cost 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.630
 but that car 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.630
 now we turn around 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.550
 and we are going to take advantage of the pieces that 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.510
 there were more than enough ropes and we're going 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.299
 to make a belt 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.599
 with something to make a loop with the part 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.800
 of the eye of the dog this is the process 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.450
 and if the figure 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.980
 we touch her in the arms 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.980
 the other piece we are going to address 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.019
 to the best of one day we make another 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.019
 as for an ornament 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.870
 here we have the pieces 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.599
 and now for now 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.880
 cut these pieces of part of the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:34.770
 neck and we sew them 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.650
 I would recommend that better before 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.220
 meet from the back 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.260
 of speed the dog these two 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 tips join them with the dress and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.940
 things in one seam 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.010
 can do is how they want 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.280
 I'm going to see if I can meet him there 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.410
 directly in this hole that I'm not going 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.530
 to put now and pass a single seam 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.450
 out there everything depends also can 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.790
 first cost the first seam of there 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.280
 under the blouse and then the strip 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.800
 above as you want but this is more 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.880
 easy if it should be a little more 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.300
 easy 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.590
 in principle clear today looks good 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.590
 let's hope that this time he stays 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.520
 alive 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.670
 and then we do the loop and you're done 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.020
 let's name it cooked and 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.020
 you like me love 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.550
 put the ficia to see how he has left 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.390
 how pretty is she says 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.390
 she is a little shy 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.790

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.960
