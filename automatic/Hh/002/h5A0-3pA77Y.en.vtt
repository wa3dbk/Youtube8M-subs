00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everyone you guessed it 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.440
 I will show the title today as 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 make cupcakes 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.360
 Here is such a complicated folder name and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 in fact these are ordinary cupcakes and do 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
 their principle is also easy as i will 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.279
 do as I will do stuffing to it 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.260
 and decorating how to decorate them and to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.449
 inside what filling I will show in it 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.890
 video you can watch sat along with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 I went for the test we need 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.079
 400 grams of flour 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.760
 pack of oil 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:45.489
 half a cup of sugar about 150 grams 2 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.710
 eggs baking powder vanillin 150 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.970
 milliliters of milk 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.470
 salt for a start we mix flour 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.470
 with vanilla and baking powder 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.309
 add one tablespoon to flour 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.309
 baking powder 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.439
 vanilla need quite a bit about 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.799
 floor coffee spoons all this you sift 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.799
 through a sieve 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.510
 add a little pinch of salt then 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.120
 another cup we stir a pack of butter 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.120
 about 200 grams with sugar 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.810
 and we get such a thick mass 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.810
 why in her we add eggs 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.700
 stir it all with a whisk 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.800
 the resulting mass gradually begin 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.800
 add milk and flour 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 in the end I should have a dough 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.170
 consistency like thick sour cream 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.150
 to make the dough more elastic and without 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.230
 lumps you can use a mixer 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 either blender 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.140
 for our cupcakes we need 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.140
 baking pans 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 as in the process of baking the dough will be 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.390
 rise then these needles 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.290
 fill in about three fourths either 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.640
 four fifths of paper form 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.790
 it is impossible to supplement the mold otherwise the dough 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.310
 just get out the oven need 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.310
 preheat to 180 degrees 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.100
 we put our pennies at about 25-30 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.760
 minutes 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 be sure to check readiness 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.530
 cupcakes so that they are not competing 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.240
 Now I will prepare the cream for us 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.040
 need half a pack of butter 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:25.790
 icing sugar cream cheese inside it 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.790
 into her 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.450
 first mix cream cheese and butter 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.450
 to thick consistency 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.690
 then we add sugar to this mass 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.690
 powder 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.610
 we fall a small pinch of vanilla 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.380
 all this is well stirred 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.380
 add three spoons about 40 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.790
 the cream is ready and in order that it is not that 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.060
 better to put it in the fridge on 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.370
 few minutes before decorating 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.980
 cupcakes cream make sure cupcakes 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.590
 completely cool because the most interesting 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.440
 we make a surprise stuffing for our 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.160
 Cupcakes I cut out neat music 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.380
 master completely and complete new 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.380
 or sweets die li 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.270
 cupcake decorations can be absolutely 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.639
 whatever you like but only 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.710
 after you have decorated your cupcakes 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.960
 better to put their opponent to the cream 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.960
 hardened so that it simply does not melt 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.670
 These are the cupcakes I got 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.380
 and you also try to do the same 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.120
