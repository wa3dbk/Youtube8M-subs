00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello to all and all his tics 59 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
 hundred a cape and today we get 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.610
 find for new and video of my 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.260
 series with a national so we knew 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.310
 left on a 1 0 win over 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.300
 sunderland 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:28.230
 in a match to face stoke city 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 and we're going so we're fifth with two 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 points late on manchester city and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 top scorers be andy carroll 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 and ib and 4th will talk so we have a match at 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:50.360
 do we do a game not the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 proposition has not changed it's the same 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 we are fifth at the bottom it is with a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.399
 match with guitar have tried to come back 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.670
 so we will change the camera because I had 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:12.090
 makes a bitter match where we will put a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.409
 telly so we will start the match 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.640
 ib who has the ball passing it to walcott 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.640
 iv again for dad 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.740
 go b 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.270
 oh no I wanted to piss you guys 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.370
 we need a victory we will try 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 to win everything 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.070
 certainly is not possible to win everything 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 my dream satisfied with a good result at 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 the end of the season so I think that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.840
 the end of six seconds I want to change 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.660
 club 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.789
 at least that will make us more challenging 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.800
 instead of staying at arsenal 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.920
 we're going badly we'll see we have to win 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.170
 matches to be famous known then 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.110
 we were shooting towards another club at the end of 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.560
 the season and so on 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.070
 we will recruit players to make 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.070
 the team even stronger and try in 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.630
 damage what did I miss 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 what a pity a good knife I thought 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.840
 I was going to put the goal 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:03:01.410
 walcott case the bullet he's scared too 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 early but paul pogba but also the pair 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 here already said here I do not know if 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:18.660
 it was ib or diaby who had put the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.660
 post is very well played but a pity 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.959
 going to go 0 0 at half time 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.080
 alex reid is shown your power his 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080
 speed 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.489
 so if you saw the match barça real 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.190
 Barça won 2 1 against Real I 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.410
 supported the real but as referee 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:12.290
 was I think well on the side of the barca 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:20.540
 with normally a penalty not whistled to 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:22.750
 second on a ronaldo then benzema 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.120
 who finds the transverse 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 he does not put it and then neymar put 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.950
 a little time to roll then alexis 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.960
 sanchez with varane I do not know what he 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.930
 did and guardian moved on instead 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.300
 to get right back on his line so 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.130
 Well, I did not like it and I was a little 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.160
 disgusted 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.020
 I hope that at the next match well at 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.340
 next clasico real barça 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.169
 I hope the real is finally fine 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.710
 shown city ​​mayors for because 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.710
 for me this real match would have won if 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.419
 the arbitrator and would be fine with the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.539
 two teams that two penaltys of 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.160
 transformed by ronaldo then ronaldo 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.410
 he also shot the guardian I 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.110
 forgot to specify it 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.110
 and so we have peasants lost 2 1 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
 pity 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:41.750
 go as long as we're happy 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.750
 20 00 ale merter at heart 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.160
 libe 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.760
 so it's over maybe not and yes 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:24.070
 it's all going gonna go it's over 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:27.310
 there it is safe 0 0 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.010
 we will not be well ranked we have in this 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:40.030
 point and we will see but manchester city 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:47.820
 did what not go and that's 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.820
 good draw 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.530
 I found it's the psp 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.530
 here 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:09.160
 abba even though at a and liverpool 2 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.400
 0 so I think they'll be up 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.950
 of the Board 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:20.950
 Tottenham 2 0 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:23.950
 I'm afraid we will see good it is 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:28.330
 eighth but I think we're here 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:34.030
 these series to the hands if I would have won 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:37.570
 played thirteen not I'll be second a 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:43.500
 exit who has already made this match so I 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:43.500
 you say good video and no more
