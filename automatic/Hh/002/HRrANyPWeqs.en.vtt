00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.800
 from buenos aires on the two trips I go to 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.660
 same place that is in the city of 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.970
 Buenos Aires and I'm quite happy 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.159
 the truth and by going to the book fair 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.890
 this as you know there was a 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.369
 hashtag moving and if it made the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.550
 fair will notice that it exists but really 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.830
 what did this trip to Argentina to the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.840
 fair was thanks to you that you reader 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.149
 I'm going to tell you a little more about that 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.430
 I still do not know exactly what it is 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.450
 what will I do to what I can tell you 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.300
 for now is that if I'm going to be on 10 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.160
 May in a talk about book tube les 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.590
 I put all the data in double the 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.789
 place the time and all that I already have 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.399
 and I'll be with guys over there 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.830
 act there as julieta I think that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.929
 julieta matti facu would love to see them 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.450
 all of you and those who are from there and 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.490
 can you go I would love to see you there 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 because I do not know when 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.170
 go back I say this casually 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.030
 beyoncé super followed but I do not know how much 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.300
 more can go back to go I would love them 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.520
 I say see them there and talk and I do not know 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200
 we take pictures I do not know how to be the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.940
 situation but I'm very excited the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 truth is that I think we do because 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.760
 part they tell me that you are re 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.350
 affectionate so maybe there is a treatment 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.300
 that may arise but I do not have it 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.250
 confirmed then I can not tell you 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.080
 but you exceed the slope of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.090
 twitter two hours as soon as I have it 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.340
 everything I'm going to put double or maybe 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.020
 is already in the double of this to another 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.700
 event that I will be this only in 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.010
 super important part this trip to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.830
 Argentina the book fair that 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.470
 really the reader to tim this one got 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.240
 on our side and said if we're going to 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.520
 take them to the Argentine fair them 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.130
 are helping in many things and between 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.990
 they have prepared a contest that is 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.290
 accompanied the book fair of 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.790
 Argentina and I'm happy the bad 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.450
 is the contest that can be bad for 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.840
 Some of you 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940
 It's just for Mexico but it has a couple of 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.370
 clauses and others from the left in the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.170
 dublin but they are basic things like that 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.560
 you have to be of legal age and you must 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.330
 to ensure that if you win you can go to 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.330
 things leave the city of mexico 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.150
 expenses run by reader to you but 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.069
 you have to leave the airport 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.510
 city ​​of mexico df then you would have 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.260
 that arriving at the airport are little things 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.200
 like these the ones that have to see dry 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.959
 not to be careful 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.760
 now as good contests is easy 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.849

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.349
