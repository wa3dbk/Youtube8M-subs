00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
know I think one of the most important

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.420 
know I think one of the most important
things<00:03:00.320> if<00:03:00.620> some<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.890> these<00:03:00.950> emails<00:03:01.100> talk

things if some of these emails talk
about<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.820> know<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.000> risks<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.360> football

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
about you know the risks of football

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.780 
about you know the risks of football
there<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.260> some<00:03:03.410> downhill<00:03:03.620> skiing<00:03:04.160> certainly

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
there is some downhill skiing certainly

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.000 
there is some downhill skiing certainly
I<00:03:05.060> mean<00:03:05.090> every<00:03:05.870> sport<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.560> any<00:03:06.740> child

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I mean every sport that any child

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.730 
I mean every sport that any child
undertakes<00:03:07.610> there<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.150> an<00:03:08.420> element<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.050> risk

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
undertakes there is an element of risk

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.470 
undertakes there is an element of risk
and<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.490> think<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.910> one<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.300> big

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
and I think that one of the big

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.690 
and I think that one of the big
questions<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.230> whether<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.160> child<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.580> doing

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
questions is whether the child is doing

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
questions is whether the child is doing
it<00:03:13.910> because<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.300> what<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> child<00:03:14.840> loves<00:03:15.110> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it because it's what the child loves and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.140 
it because it's what the child loves and
wants<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.500> do<00:03:15.680> or<00:03:16.070> whether<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.580> parents<00:03:17.030> are

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
wants to do or whether the parents are

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.000 
wants to do or whether the parents are
