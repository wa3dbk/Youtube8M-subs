for you for whatever reason but I
wouldn't<00:02:00.899> worry<00:02:01.050> too<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.979> bad

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
wouldn't worry too much about them bad

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.510 
wouldn't worry too much about them bad
things<00:02:02.690> seem<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.869> happen<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.229> those<00:02:04.619> guys<00:02:05.040> like

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
things seem to happen to those guys like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
things seem to happen to those guys like
this<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.000> where<00:02:06.390> did<00:02:06.780> he<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.200> oh<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
this one where did he go oh there he is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.949 
this one where did he go oh there he is
at<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.820> beginning<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> demo<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.750> says

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
at the beginning of the demo it says

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.380 
at the beginning of the demo it says
also<00:02:13.320> don't<00:02:14.040> skip<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.489> weapon<00:02:14.790> crafting<00:02:15.000> room

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
also don't skip the weapon crafting room

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
also don't skip the weapon crafting room
so<00:02:15.870> naturally<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.410> skip<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.830> webbing<00:02:17.070> crafting

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so naturally I skip the webbing crafting

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.110 
so naturally I skip the webbing crafting
room<00:02:17.580> instead<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.120> did<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.720> lot

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.610 

but<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> played<00:02:26.659> through<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.900> second<00:02:27.260> time<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
but I played through a second time and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.500 
but I played through a second time and
gave<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.950> look<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.579> demo<00:02:28.939> really

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
gave it a look and this demo really

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.630 
gave it a look and this demo really
emphasizes<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.620> weapon<00:02:30.980> crafting<00:02:31.189> almost

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
emphasizes the weapon crafting almost

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.759 
emphasizes the weapon crafting almost
more<00:02:31.760> than<00:02:31.790> anything<00:02:32.150> boy<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:33.079> you<00:02:33.140> pick<00:02:33.439> up<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
more than anything boy do you pick up a

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.399 
more than anything boy do you pick up a
lot<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.220> craft<00:02:35.379> ink<00:02:37.420> materials<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:39.079> took<00:02:39.260> me<00:02:39.379> a

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
lot of craft ink materials it took me a

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.960 
lot of craft ink materials it took me a
bit<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.650> figure<00:02:39.980> out<00:02:40.129> but<00:02:40.280> eventually<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.730> got

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
bit to figure out but eventually I got

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.789 
bit to figure out but eventually I got
the<00:02:41.090> hang<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.359> it<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.780> mostly<00:02:42.109> I<00:02:42.379> just<00:02:42.560> like

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
the hang of it but mostly I just like

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.800 
the hang of it but mostly I just like
the<00:02:43.010> machine<00:02:43.340> gun<00:02:43.549> bang<00:02:43.909> bang<00:02:44.090> bang<00:02:44.299> bang<00:02:44.480> bang

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the machine gun bang bang bang bang bang

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.330 
the machine gun bang bang bang bang bang
bang<00:02:44.870> bang<00:02:45.079> bang<00:02:45.260> bang<00:02:45.439> bang<00:02:45.769> bang<00:02:45.829> did<00:02:46.220> you

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
bang bang bang bang bang bang did you

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.580 
bang bang bang bang bang bang did you
know<00:02:46.519> that<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:46.849> game<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.390> better<00:02:48.079> with

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
know that this game is better with

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.099 
know that this game is better with
Kinect<00:02:49.250> well<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.299> what<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.450> hear<00:02:50.629> anyway<00:02:50.959> I

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
Kinect well that's what I hear anyway I

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.780 
Kinect well that's what I hear anyway I
don't<00:02:51.319> actually<00:02:51.439> have<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.099> if<00:02:52.189> I<00:02:52.310> did<00:02:52.579> I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
don't actually have one but if I did I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.839 
don't actually have one but if I did I
imagine<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.450> goes<00:02:53.659> something<00:02:53.900> like<00:02:54.079> this

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
imagine it goes something like this

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.920 
imagine it goes something like this
Xbox<00:02:55.849> reload<00:02:56.870> Xbox<00:02:57.769> click<00:02:58.220> your<00:02:58.540> Xbox<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.900> a
