00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:59.440
 Well see that the application is v with perceptual verb + o + img 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:04.000
 There is a perceptual verb + o + past participle to see that cherry blossoms are v 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.229

 Because I say flows of I mean Tsu story timing it is flowing in the wind 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.280
