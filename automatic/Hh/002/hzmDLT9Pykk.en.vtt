database and one of the things I wanted

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
database and one of the things I wanted
to<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.829> take<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:56.309> through<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to do was just take a look through this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
to do was just take a look through this
database<00:00:57.059> break<00:00:57.629> down<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> stats<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.890> if

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
database break down the stats see if

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.439 
database break down the stats see if
there<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.160> any<00:00:59.250> areas<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.030> things<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
there are any areas or things that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.139 
there are any areas or things that
jumped<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.109> us<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.820> wanted<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
jumped out at us that that we wanted to

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.359 
jumped out at us that that we wanted to
analyze<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:03.870> doing<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.860> our<00:01:05.010> reviews

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
analyze when doing some of our reviews

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.120 
analyze when doing some of our reviews
together<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
together so one thing that you can do is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
together so one thing that you can do is
and<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> did<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.540> him<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.750> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
do this for like five games it's not

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
do this for like five games it's not
gonna<00:01:26.040> mean<00:01:26.220> anything<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:27.840> gonna

gonna mean anything and what we're gonna
do<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> break<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:30.020> your<00:01:31.020> stats<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.979> blind

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
do is break down your stats by blind

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.660 
do is break down your stats by blind
level<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.560> example<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.189> you'll<00:01:35.369> see

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
level so for example here you'll see

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.890 
level so for example here you'll see
you'll<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.720> blind

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you'll see all the different blind

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
you'll see all the different blind
levels<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.320> big<00:01:37.500> blind<00:01:37.740> 20<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> way<00:01:38.759> up

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
levels from big blind 20 all the way up

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.580 
levels from big blind 20 all the way up
to<00:01:39.240> big<00:01:39.960> blind<00:01:40.259> 3,000<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.840> obviously<00:01:43.500> if

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to big blind 3,000 you know obviously if

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
to big blind 3,000 you know obviously if
you're<00:01:43.680> playing<00:01:43.860> 180<00:01:44.460> mins<00:01:44.729> you're<00:01:44.939> gonna

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you're playing 180 mins you're gonna

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
you're playing 180 mins you're gonna
have<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.869> hands<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> bigger<00:01:47.280> blind

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
have more hands at the bigger blind

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.520 
have more hands at the bigger blind
levels<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.119> 18<00:01:48.390> bands<00:01:48.630> you're<00:01:49.259> typically

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
levels but for 18 bands you're typically

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
here at big blind 50 was that the big

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.819 
here at big blind 50 was that the big
blind<00:02:47.519> 400<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.419> negative<00:02:48.840> slightly

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
blind 400 was actually negative slightly

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.460 
blind 400 was actually negative slightly
positive<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> EEV<00:02:50.579> big<00:02:50.970> blind<00:02:51.209> 400<00:02:51.689> but

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
positive on the EEV big blind 400 but

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.640 
positive on the EEV big blind 400 but
still<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.919> very<00:02:53.129> low<00:02:53.459> number<00:02:54.109> and<00:02:55.109> that

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
still it's a very low number and that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.080 
still it's a very low number and that
was<00:02:55.769> over<00:02:56.010> 7,000<00:02:56.669> hands<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.000> that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
was over 7,000 hands so that's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.750 
was over 7,000 hands so that's
definitely<00:02:57.389> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.870> pretty<00:02:58.079> meaningful<00:02:58.760> so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
definitely you know pretty meaningful so

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.390 
definitely you know pretty meaningful so
that<00:03:00.750> gave<00:03:01.139> me<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.500> hint<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.799> maybe<00:03:02.219> we<00:03:02.370> need

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that gave me the hint that maybe we need

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.979 
that gave me the hint that maybe we need
to<00:03:02.549> take<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.730> look<00:03:02.939> at<00:03:03.030> big<00:03:03.209> blind<00:03:03.419> 50<00:03:03.780> maybe

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.259 
to take a look at big blind 50 maybe
he's<00:03:04.169> getting<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.409> little<00:03:04.500> bit<00:03:04.680> too<00:03:04.799> aggressive

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
he's getting a little bit too aggressive

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.550 
he's getting a little bit too aggressive
getting<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> all<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.750> because<00:03:06.959> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
getting it all in because this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.349 
getting it all in because this
particular<00:03:07.739> player<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.519> on<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.000> aggressive

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
particular player is on the aggressive

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.789 
particular player is on the aggressive
side<00:03:09.480> he's<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.689> really<00:03:10.109> really<00:03:10.139> good<00:03:10.530> player

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
side he's a really really good player

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.970 
side he's a really really good player
but<00:03:11.040> does<00:03:11.669> tend<00:03:11.969> to<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:13.079> get<00:03:13.230> aggressive<00:03:13.739> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
but does tend to to get aggressive so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.569 
but does tend to to get aggressive so

you<00:03:38.129> want<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> try<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.519> figure<00:03:38.729> out<00:03:38.939> where<00:03:39.239> you

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
you want to try to figure out where you

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.920 
you want to try to figure out where you
need<00:03:39.629> to<00:03:39.750> look<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.729> to<00:03:41.729> identify<00:03:42.209> areas<00:03:42.449> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
need to look to to identify areas to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.379 
need to look to to identify areas to
that<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:43.919> improve<00:03:44.099> upon<00:03:44.400> look<00:03:45.090> for

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
that that you can improve upon look for

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.969 
that that you can improve upon look for
blind<00:03:45.750> levels<00:03:46.079> obviously<00:03:46.439> look<00:03:46.590> at<00:03:46.650> number<00:03:46.889> of

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
blind levels obviously look at number of

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.140 
blind levels obviously look at number of
hands<00:03:47.189> to<00:03:47.400> make<00:03:47.519> sure<00:03:47.669> it's<00:03:47.819> meaningful

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
hands to make sure it's meaningful

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.670 
hands to make sure it's meaningful
obviously<00:03:48.659> 11<00:03:48.930> hands<00:03:49.109> doesn't<00:03:49.290> mean<00:03:49.500> nothing

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
obviously 11 hands doesn't mean nothing

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.309 
obviously 11 hands doesn't mean nothing
so<00:03:52.819> be<00:03:53.819> blind<00:03:54.060> 57,000<00:03:54.900> hands<00:03:55.109> pretty

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
so be blind 57,000 hands pretty

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.710 
so be blind 57,000 hands pretty
meaningful<00:03:55.819> negative<00:03:56.819> big<00:03:57.239> blinds<00:03:57.479> per

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
meaningful negative big blinds per

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
meaningful negative big blinds per
hundred<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.769> would<00:03:58.889> be<00:03:58.979> an<00:03:59.069> area<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
hundred so that would be an area of the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.789 
hundred so that would be an area of the
game<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.759> keep<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.239> particular<00:04:00.629> Clause<00:04:01.229> to<00:04:01.650> pay

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
game to keep a particular Clause to pay

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.789 
game to keep a particular Clause to pay
particular<00:04:01.979> close<00:04:02.340> attention<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:04.319> see<00:04:04.560> if

particular close attention to to see if

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.309

maybe<00:04:05.280> you're<00:04:05.759> risking<00:04:06.329> your<00:04:06.959> tournament

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
maybe you're risking your tournament

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.159 
maybe you're risking your tournament
life<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.889> little<00:04:08.129> bit<00:04:08.310> too<00:04:08.489> liberally<00:04:09.169> getting

it all in a little bit too loose who

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
knows but that can at least give you a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.080 
knows but that can at least give you a
tip<00:04:14.669> of<00:04:14.819> where<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.120> look<00:04:15.470> second<00:04:16.470> thing<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
tip of where to look second thing to

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.509 
tip of where to look second thing to
look<00:04:18.209> at<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.570> said<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.620> big<00:04:19.829> blind<00:04:19.979> 200

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
look at as I said is the big blind 200

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.930 
look at as I said is the big blind 200
to<00:04:20.609> big<00:04:20.789> blind<00:04:21.060> 200<00:04:21.959> with<00:04:22.049> an<00:04:22.200> T<00:04:22.289> 25<00:04:22.590> jump<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.430> my

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
to big blind 200 with an T 25 jump in my

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.060 
to big blind 200 with an T 25 jump in my
opinion<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.389> one<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> biggest<00:04:25.080> and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
opinion this is one of the biggest and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.650 
opinion this is one of the biggest and
most<00:04:26.099> important<00:04:26.849> areas<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
most important areas of the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.380 
most important areas of the
based<00:04:28.110> upon<00:04:28.580> stealing<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.670> pot<00:04:29.850> stealing<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
based upon stealing the pot stealing the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.910 
based upon stealing the pot stealing the
blinds<00:04:30.630> obviously<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.230> typically<00:04:31.470> in

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
blinds obviously this is typically in

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.150 
blinds obviously this is typically in
your<00:04:32.040> mid<00:04:32.250> game<00:04:32.430> area<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.800> those<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.040> have

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
your mid game area for those that have

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.030 
your mid game area for those that have
seen<00:04:35.310> my<00:04:35.430> videos<00:04:35.790> they<00:04:35.970> know<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> love<00:04:37.040> talking

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
seen my videos they know I love talking

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.440 
seen my videos they know I love talking
about<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.550> particular<00:04:38.760> area<00:04:39.180> because<00:04:39.270> I

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
about this particular area because I

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.060 
about this particular area because I
think<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.930> something<00:04:40.650> most<00:04:40.740> people<00:04:40.860> don't

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
think it's something most people don't

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.150 
think it's something most people don't
really<00:04:41.340> pay<00:04:41.550> attention<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.970> but<00:04:43.160> essentially

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
really pay attention to but essentially

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.710 
really pay attention to but essentially
what<00:04:44.250> I'm<00:04:44.340> looking<00:04:44.580> for<00:04:44.730> from<00:04:44.880> big<00:04:45.060> blind<00:04:45.300> 200

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
what I'm looking for from big blind 200

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.320 
what I'm looking for from big blind 200
to<00:04:45.780> big<00:04:45.900> blind<00:04:46.140> 200<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:46.950> an<00:04:47.070> e<00:04:47.100> 25<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.970> a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
to big blind 200 with an e 25 is a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.070 
to big blind 200 with an e 25 is a
significant<00:04:49.110> increase<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.650> aggression

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
significant increase in aggression

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.150 
significant increase in aggression
because<00:04:52.080> quite<00:04:52.350> simply<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.740> have<00:04:52.830> more<00:04:53.040> of<00:04:53.100> a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
because quite simply you have more of a

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.550 
because quite simply you have more of a
valuable<00:04:53.430> path<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.850> steal<00:04:54.060> at<00:04:54.330> big<00:04:54.810> blind<00:04:55.050> 280

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
valuable path to steal at big blind 280

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.750 
valuable path to steal at big blind 280
20<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.980> 25<00:04:56.340> there<00:04:56.550> are<00:04:56.610> two<00:04:56.790> key<00:04:57.030> things<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:58.290> is

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
20 to 25 there are two key things one is

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.250 
20 to 25 there are two key things one is
you<00:04:59.760> typically<00:05:00.480> still<00:05:00.690> have<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> full

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
you typically still have like a full

you typically still have like a full

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
table 8 9 players at that level it's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.550 
table 8 9 players at that level it's
still<00:05:03.510> relatively<00:05:03.990> early<00:05:04.170> but<00:05:05.010> also<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:07.080> ante

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
still relatively early but also the ante

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.920 
still relatively early but also the ante
is<00:05:07.740> about<00:05:08.220> 12<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.670> half<00:05:08.730> percent<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:09.420> the

big blind you see it's an e 25 at big

blind 200 at all the other levels the
ante<00:05:14.130> represents<00:05:14.730> a<00:05:14.850> smaller<00:05:15.240> percentage<00:05:15.780> of

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the actual big blind so the percentage

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.110 
the actual big blind so the percentage

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.800 
jump and if you look here big blind 400
at<00:05:33.740> big<00:05:34.740> blind<00:05:34.950> 200<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.490> about<00:05:35.670> 3.2<00:05:36.150> big<00:05:37.140> blind

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
400 at 280 25 but 7.0 8 so it's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.540 
400 at 280 25 but 7.0 8 so it's
profitable<00:05:43.020> but<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.040> other<00:05:44.160> key<00:05:44.340> thing<00:05:44.520> to

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
profitable but the other key thing to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.550 
profitable but the other key thing to
look<00:05:44.730> at<00:05:44.910> is<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.450> aggression<00:05:45.960> was<00:05:46.110> relatively

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
look at is the aggression was relatively

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.450 
look at is the aggression was relatively
the<00:05:46.710> same<00:05:46.770> 26<00:05:47.580> 22<00:05:48.240> be<00:05:48.870> fit<00:05:49.050> preflop<00:05:49.440> raise<00:05:49.740> so
