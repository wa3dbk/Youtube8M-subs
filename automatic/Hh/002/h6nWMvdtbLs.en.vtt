00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
running back in the game at least in my

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
running back in the game at least in my
opinion<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.829> don't<00:00:40.860> think<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.430> close<00:00:41.699> though

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
opinion I don't think it's close though

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
opinion I don't think it's close though
because<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.170> fast<00:00:43.559> he<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.399> just

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because of how fast he is it's just

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
because of how fast he is it's just
freakish<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.140> haven't<00:00:46.440> used<00:00:46.559> him<00:00:46.770> yet

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
freakish if you haven't used him yet

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.080 
freakish if you haven't used him yet
you're<00:00:47.100> definitely<00:00:47.280> gonna<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> check<00:00:47.969> it
