00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680 
at the back your head you're gonna try
to<00:04:01.739> get<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.220> do<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> couple<00:04:02.610> circles<00:04:03.390> like

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
to get it to do a couple circles like

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.900 
to get it to do a couple circles like
that<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.860> Kate<00:04:05.040> hit<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.340> like<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:07.910> loop

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
that so Kate hit you like that loop

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.090 
that so Kate hit you like that loop
again<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:09.900> coming<00:04:10.110> down<00:04:10.470> you've<00:04:10.830> got<00:04:10.860> your

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
again it's coming down you've got your

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.440 
again it's coming down you've got your
focus<00:04:11.610> point<00:04:11.670> over<00:04:11.970> there<00:04:12.120> you're<00:04:12.239> coming

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
focus point over there you're coming

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.110 
focus point over there you're coming
down<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.900> point<00:04:13.340> try<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> flip<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.820> up<00:04:15.060> and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
down that point try to flip it up and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.560 
down that point try to flip it up and
around<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.540> down<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.459> down<00:04:17.940> down<00:04:20.359> so<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.450> got

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
around and down and down down so you got

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.090 
around and down and down down so you got
a<00:04:21.600> feeling<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.320> also<00:04:22.500> go

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
a feeling and if you also go

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.150 
a feeling and if you also go
this<00:04:23.310> way<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.700> also<00:04:23.820> come

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
this way it can also come

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.790 
this way it can also come
sway<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.990> way<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.880> way<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.380> now<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.590> want

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
sway this way this way so now you want

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.710 
sway this way this way so now you want
to<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:30.950> circle<00:04:31.250> down<00:04:31.400> behind<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:32.030> in<00:04:32.270> front

of you you start again circle behind and

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.080 
of you you start again circle behind and
in<00:04:37.610> front<00:04:37.640> behind<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:39.050> front<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.820> as<00:04:41.000> you

it might be totally disorienting but
with<00:05:23.000> practice<00:05:23.270> just<00:05:23.750> start<00:05:23.900> getting<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.140> few

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
with practice just start getting a few

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.550 
with practice just start getting a few
circles<00:05:25.550> behind<00:05:25.940> you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.660 

and<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.650> want<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:30.980> to<00:05:31.040> try<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.220> flip<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.610> around

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
and I want you to try to flip it around

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
so it comes down over there down over

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.340 
so it comes down over there down over
there

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.070 

down<00:05:42.350> over<00:05:42.710> there<00:05:43.060> then<00:05:44.060> in<00:05:44.150> front<00:05:44.480> of<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:44.720> you

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
down over there then in front of you you

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.100 
down over there then in front of you you
also<00:05:45.470> flip<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:46.390> there<00:05:47.390> comes<00:05:47.570> down<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:47.900> so<00:05:47.960> for

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
also flip it there comes down and so for

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.909 
also flip it there comes down and so for
me<00:05:48.200> it's<00:05:48.290> coming<00:05:48.440> down<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.710> chimney<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:51.680> front

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
me it's coming down the chimney in front

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.159 
me it's coming down the chimney in front
of<00:05:51.980> my<00:05:52.070> head<00:05:53.560> then<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.650> can<00:05:54.770> go<00:05:54.860> behind<00:05:55.040> my<00:05:55.340> head

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
of my head then I can go behind my head

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.850 
of my head then I can go behind my head
scoop<00:05:58.090> until<00:05:59.090> I<00:05:59.150> can<00:05:59.300> make<00:05:59.390> a<00:05:59.419> circle<00:05:59.870> in<00:06:00.740> front

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
scoop until I can make a circle in front

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.340 
scoop until I can make a circle in front
of<00:06:01.100> me<00:06:01.250> boom<00:06:01.790> boom<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:03.130> behind<00:06:04.130> me<00:06:04.810> boom<00:06:05.810> boom

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
of me boom boom and behind me boom boom

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.860 
of me boom boom and behind me boom boom
and<00:06:06.730> then<00:06:07.730> I'm<00:06:08.000> gonna<00:06:08.120> try<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.330> flip<00:06:08.570> from<00:06:08.690> one

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
and then I'm gonna try to flip from one

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.159 
and then I'm gonna try to flip from one
to<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.020> other<00:06:09.220> side<00:06:10.220> flip<00:06:10.340> from<00:06:10.640> behind<00:06:11.600> to<00:06:12.050> in

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
to the other side flip from behind to in

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.409 
to the other side flip from behind to in
front<00:06:12.610> now<00:06:13.610> I'd<00:06:13.820> be<00:06:13.940> all<00:06:14.060> wacky<00:06:14.300> at<00:06:14.540> first

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
front now I'd be all wacky at first

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.640 
front now I'd be all wacky at first
behind<00:06:17.419> two<00:06:17.720> in<00:06:17.810> front<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:21.050> eventually

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
behind two in front and eventually

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.040 
behind two in front and eventually
you're<00:06:21.740> gonna<00:06:21.830> be<00:06:21.919> able<00:06:21.980> to<00:06:22.070> go<00:06:22.540> fronts<00:06:23.540> behind

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
you're gonna be able to go fronts behind

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.290 
you're gonna be able to go fronts behind
