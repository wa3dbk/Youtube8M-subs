to the trunk area again and we see that

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.260 
to the trunk area again and we see that
the<00:03:43.840> entire<00:03:44.200> top<00:03:44.530> collapses<00:03:45.370> into<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:46.030> trunk

Stability traction control which is a

Stability traction control which is a
real<00:04:30.940> advantage<00:04:31.780> good<00:04:32.320> system<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:33.760> actually

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
real advantage good system that actually

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.150 
real advantage good system that actually
reduces<00:04:34.690> power<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.380> breaks<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.800> wheel<00:04:35.980> that's

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
reduces power and breaks a wheel that's

spinning<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.820> control<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:38.650> also<00:04:38.830> gives

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
spinning out of control it also gives

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.070 
spinning out of control it also gives
you<00:04:39.280> more<00:04:39.460> stability<00:04:39.700> around<00:04:40.330> curves<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.990> we

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
you more stability around curves so we

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.230 
you more stability around curves so we
won't<00:04:41.290> slide<00:04:41.620> out<00:04:41.860> again<00:04:42.670> that's<00:04:42.880> standard

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
won't slide out again that's standard
