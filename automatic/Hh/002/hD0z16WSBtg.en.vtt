this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:13.990> test<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.650> dragon<00:02:15.100> dictation

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
this is a test of the dragon dictation

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520 
this is a test of the dragon dictation
software<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.240> found<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.080> doesn't<00:02:17.410> work

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
software I found that it doesn't work

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:26.310 
software I found that it doesn't work
too<00:02:17.770> well<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:18.100> punctuation<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.140> see

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
too well with punctuation so you can see

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.400 
too well with punctuation so you can see
that<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:27.390> even<00:02:28.390> though<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> paused<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.200> period

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that a even though I paused for a period

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.830 
that a even though I paused for a period
there<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.920> didn't<00:02:30.190> really<00:02:30.310> put<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.670> in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
there it didn't really put it in

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.150 
there it didn't really put it in
occasionally<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.990> has<00:02:32.170> added<00:02:32.500> punctuation

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
occasionally it has added punctuation

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.540 
occasionally it has added punctuation
for<00:02:33.190> me<00:02:33.580> but<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.120> don't<00:02:34.360> find<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.720> too<00:02:34.990> reliable

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.700 

so<00:02:42.550> but<00:02:43.420> one<00:02:43.570> thing<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.960> do<00:02:44.080> really<00:02:44.470> like

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
so but one thing that I do really like

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.030 
so but one thing that I do really like
that<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.130> does<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:48.210> if<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.830> say

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
that this does is that if you say

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.090 
that this does is that if you say
something<00:02:51.490> like<00:02:52.320> there<00:02:53.320> are<00:02:53.500> two<00:02:53.770> too<00:02:54.070> many

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
something like there are two too many

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.360 
something like there are two too many
toothbrushes<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.360> brush<00:02:55.570> my<00:02:55.810> teeth<00:02:59.190> you<00:03:00.190> can

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
toothbrushes to brush my teeth you can

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.340 
toothbrushes to brush my teeth you can
see<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.580> all<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.240> versions<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.750> two<00:03:01.990> are

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
see that all the versions of two are

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.840 
see that all the versions of two are
covered<00:03:02.980> there<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.190> works<00:03:06.520> well<00:03:06.730> with

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
covered there and so it works well with

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.060 
covered there and so it works well with
homonyms<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.570> has<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> software<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.560> determine

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
homonyms it has a software to determine

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.500 
homonyms it has a software to determine
which<00:03:09.250> one<00:03:09.460> you're<00:03:09.610> trying<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.970> use<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.390> that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
which one you're trying to use in that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020 
which one you're trying to use in that
context<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:12.130> that's<00:03:12.370> one<00:03:12.520> thing<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.910> think

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
context so that's one thing that I think

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.330 
context so that's one thing that I think
it's<00:03:13.300> really<00:03:13.540> good<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.930> will<00:03:14.140> come<00:03:14.950> in<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> lot

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
it's really good and will come in a lot

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.580 
it's really good and will come in a lot
of<00:03:15.400> help<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:18.240> let's<00:03:19.240> delete<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.959> now

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
into it and I won't really pick up what

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.810

got all the suggestions for what it
could<00:03:48.820> have<00:03:48.940> been<00:03:49.440> none<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.470> them<00:03:50.650> are<00:03:50.800> really

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
could have been none of them are really

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.740 
could have been none of them are really
correct<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:51.640> was<00:03:51.970> trying<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.390> speak<00:03:52.600> um

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.170 
correct but I was trying to speak um
clearly<00:03:53.020> so<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.500> would<00:03:53.590> give<00:03:53.739> me<00:03:53.770> these

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
clearly so that it would give me these

copy to clipboard the copy to clipboard

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.039 
copy to clipboard the copy to clipboard
is<00:04:18.160> pretty<00:04:18.340> much<00:04:18.489> self-explanatory<00:04:19.049> it'll

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
is pretty much self-explanatory it'll
