00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 in the course of bioprocess engineering and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 positive university biotechnology 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.490
 to be prepared to act in the area of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.430
 biochemical processes and industries and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 laboratories will learn in practice 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 develop process improvements and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 biotechnological products Council of 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.370
 laboratories appropriate to the activities of the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.559
 course can also develop projects 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.300
 of biotechnology equipment 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.040
 the teachers are masters and doctors 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 operating in the market ensured 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 student learning the curriculum matrix 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 course was prepared in accordance with the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.329
 mec requirements and market 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.579
 job 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.079
 directing the areas of action in which 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.020
 the student can be entered 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.570
 in addition the course schedule 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.219
 allows the student to gain experience 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 carrying out other activities such as 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.770
 example an internship in a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.719
 area 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.270
 the students have available laboratories 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.189
 for the combination of theory and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 practice in class goes through the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 microbiology laboratory operations 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.560
 units and computers still have classes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.350
 biochemistry and genetics practices beyond 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.549
 of industrial biotechnology microscopy 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 and chemistry 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.909
 with this they can visualize what they learn 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.409
 in the classroom 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.420
 the important factor for enrichment 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.189
 of the curriculum is the possibility of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 exchanges with the support of the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.310
 positive university 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 we can also join project 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 scientific research in conjunction with the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 Masters in Biotechnology opep the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.049
 bioprocess engineering and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.479
 biotechnology expansion both in the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.280
 Brazil and abroad because several 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.020
 professions of the future are related to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 with our activities at Pedro 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.790
 importance for the knowledge of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.820
 engineering and biological process in progress 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 practical training and applied by 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.219
 this the student must have knowledge of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.380
 mathematics physics biology and chemistry a 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.630
 professional practice should promote the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 interaction between scientific research 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.000
 that the demands of the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.890
 bioprocess engineer 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.729
 biotechnology has a profile 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620
 innovative 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.330
 the professional can act as 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.730
 entrepreneur and run his own business 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.540
 creating new technological solutions for 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.700
 the market 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.650
 the teaching and research areas can be 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 the focus of this engineer following 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.620
 courses of master's and master's 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.210
 doctorate degree 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.860
 The purpose of the course is to train 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.100
 professionals to work in the production 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.010
 biomolecules as pharmaceuticals 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.950
 enzymes that pigments besides food 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.930
 fermented beverages and fuel and 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.980
 products for agriculture and 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.080
 environment 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.209
 already in the laboratory it is possible to work 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.520
 with research in the development and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.680
 conducting engineering analyzes of 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.239
 bioprocess and biotechnology this is 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.209
 work in laboratories and industries 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.190
 of food and drink in drug villages 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.320
 vaccines and also the field of 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.290
 biofuels in the environmental area as 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.450
 for example bioremediation work 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.700
 often starts in the laboratory with 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.400
 genetic engineering reasons 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.230
 of microorganisms whose reasoning is 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.980
 also be able to work in the area of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.810
 search 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.850
 I, for example, need to work with 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.040
 computing in data analysis 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.810
 biological products produced from 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.810
 genomic and proteomic techniques 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.460
 liked what he saw 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.930
 want to know our course closely 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.740
