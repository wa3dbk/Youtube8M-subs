00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
thing you can see on the wireless charge

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
thing you can see on the wireless charge
there's<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.750> material<00:00:48.930> around<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there's much more material around the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
there's much more material around the
edges<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.160> everything<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:50.789> what's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
edges and everything and that's what's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
edges and everything and that's what's
going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> accept<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> charging<00:00:52.579> for<00:00:53.579> the

don't<00:02:14.950> line<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.549> correctly<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.209> if<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.420> just

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
don't line up correctly but if you just

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.530 
don't line up correctly but if you just
notice<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.530> lay<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:19.299> still

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
notice here I lay it down you still

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.209 
notice here I lay it down you still
heard<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.109> you<00:02:20.200> still<00:02:20.499> saw<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> indicator

heard it and you still saw the indicator

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.099 
heard it and you still saw the indicator
so<00:02:21.939> it<00:02:22.060> doesn't<00:02:22.269> have<00:02:22.389> to<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.569> perfect<00:02:23.019> it
