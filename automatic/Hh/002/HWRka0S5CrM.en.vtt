00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi my name is James Flint I'm a

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.260 
hi my name is James Flint I'm a
professional<00:00:02.340> photographer<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:03.060> I'd<00:00:03.120> like

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
professional photographer and I'd like

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.430 
professional photographer and I'd like
to<00:00:03.389> take<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> moment<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.990> talk<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:04.350> about

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
to take a moment to talk to you about

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.030 
to take a moment to talk to you about
how<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.100> camera<00:00:05.879> lens<00:00:06.060> aperture<00:00:06.330> works<00:00:07.040> first

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
how the camera lens aperture works first

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.350 
how the camera lens aperture works first
off<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.400> important<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> understand<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
off it's important to understand the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
off it's important to understand the
function<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:09.900> aperture<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:11.040> can

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
function of an aperture you can

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.890 
function of an aperture you can
basically<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> aperture<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.570> like

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
basically think of the aperture is like

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
basically think of the aperture is like
your<00:00:13.139> cameras<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:15.299> more<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.350> open<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
your cameras I the more it is open the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.950 
your cameras I the more it is open the
more<00:00:17.609> light<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> come<00:00:18.630> into

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
more light that is going to come into

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
more light that is going to come into
your<00:00:19.109> camera<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.880> less<00:00:21.390> depth<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.900> field

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
your camera but the less depth of field

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
your camera but the less depth of field
you<00:00:22.230> will<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.279> more<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.519> close<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
you will have the more you close it the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.820 
you will have the more you close it the
less<00:00:24.539> light<00:00:24.779> will<00:00:24.960> come<00:00:24.990> into<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.560> camera

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
less light will come into your camera

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
less light will come into your camera
but<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.970> increasing<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.599> depth<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
but you will be increasing your depth of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.689 
but you will be increasing your depth of
field<00:00:28.199> now<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.099> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> gets<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.580> little

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
field now it kind of gets a little

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.770 
field now it kind of gets a little
confusing<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.980> bigger<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
confusing because the bigger the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170 
confusing because the bigger the
aperture<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> open<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.190> smaller<00:00:35.520> aperture

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
aperture is open the smaller aperture

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
aperture is open the smaller aperture
number<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.020> an<00:00:37.140> aperture<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.160> or

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
number so an aperture of like two or

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.530 
number so an aperture of like two or
four<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> very<00:00:39.930> wide<00:00:40.250> open<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
four is going to have a very wide open I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.670 
four is going to have a very wide open I
wide<00:00:42.540> open<00:00:42.840> aperture<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
wide open aperture and it's going to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.350 
wide open aperture and it's going to
allow<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.250> light<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> come<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
allow a lot more light to come into the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.040 
allow a lot more light to come into the
camera<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> ideal<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.719> if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
camera this is ideal if you you know if

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
camera this is ideal if you you know if
you're<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.469> low<00:00:49.620> light<00:00:49.829> situation<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you're in a low light situation if you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
you're in a low light situation if you
don't<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.949> aperture<00:00:53.219> open<00:00:53.699> wide

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
don't have your aperture open wide

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.040 
don't have your aperture open wide
enough<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.780> enough

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
enough you're not going to get enough

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.510 
enough you're not going to get enough
light<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.829> not<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> capture

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
light in and you're not going to capture

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.750 
light in and you're not going to capture
an<00:00:56.610> image<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.430> camera

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
an image you can see here on my camera

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
an image you can see here on my camera
that<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> spin<00:01:01.079> dial<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that I have a spin dial right on the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.440 
that I have a spin dial right on the
front<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> controls<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> aperture<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
front and this controls the aperture the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.730 
front and this controls the aperture the
lowest<00:01:06.450> aperture<00:01:06.840> setting<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.380> camera

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
lowest aperture setting on this camera

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.210 
lowest aperture setting on this camera
is<00:01:07.770> 3.5<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:10.020> highest<00:01:10.409> aperture<00:01:10.799> setting<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
is 3.5 the highest aperture setting on

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.480 
is 3.5 the highest aperture setting on
this<00:01:11.340> camera<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.820> 22<00:01:13.100> aperture<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> also

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this camera is 22 aperture is also

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
this camera is 22 aperture is also
called<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.820> f-stop<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.049> someone<00:01:16.380> might<00:01:16.500> call

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
called a f-stop so someone might call

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490 
called a f-stop so someone might call
that<00:01:16.770> f-22<00:01:17.759> again<00:01:18.630> there's<00:01:18.840> multiple<00:01:19.200> ways<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that f-22 again there's multiple ways to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
that f-22 again there's multiple ways to
say<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.710> same<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.430> cameras<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
say the same thing with cameras but it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
say the same thing with cameras but it's
just<00:01:21.630> mostly<00:01:21.900> important<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> understand<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
just mostly important to understand that

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.990 
just mostly important to understand that
as<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.320> decrease<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.340> number<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.909> your

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
as you decrease the the number of your

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.030 
as you decrease the the number of your
f-stop<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:29.009> or

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
f-stop like going down to like two or

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
f-stop like going down to like two or
three<00:01:29.640> point<00:01:30.150> five<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> make

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
three point five you're going to make

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.609 
three point five you're going to make
that<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:32.210> wider<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.750> open<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that I wider and more open so more like

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.090 
that I wider and more open so more like
can<00:01:34.890> come<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.990> consequently<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
can come in and consequently if you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.819 
can come in and consequently if you
close<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> larger<00:01:40.290> f-stop

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
close it down with a larger f-stop

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
close it down with a larger f-stop
number<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> smaller

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
number you're going to have a smaller

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
number you're going to have a smaller
opening<00:01:43.020> less<00:01:43.619> light<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.040> come<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.090> at

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
opening less light will come in but at

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
opening less light will come in but at
the<00:01:45.240> same<00:01:45.479> time<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:45.899> gaining<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> greater

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the same time you're gaining a greater

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
the same time you're gaining a greater
