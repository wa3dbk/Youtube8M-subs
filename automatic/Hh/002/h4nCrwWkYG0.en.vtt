one one little box there for nine

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380 
one one little box there for nine
because<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:46.890> hardly<00:00:46.920> no<00:00:47.309> power<00:00:47.520> used

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
stuff usually the central air is running

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.860 
stuff usually the central air is running
pretty<00:00:58.230> good<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.309> evening<00:00:59.760> than<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> is

pretty good in the evening than it is
during<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> day<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.869> off<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> ebay

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.940 

again<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> great<00:01:13.080> tool<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> let<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> know

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
again it's a great tool to let you know

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.929 
again it's a great tool to let you know
exactly<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.700> much<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:16.549> Waddy<00:01:17.549> wise

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
exactly how much you're using Waddy wise

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
exactly how much you're using Waddy wise
I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.840> I've<00:01:18.990> cut<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> hundred<00:01:19.409> dollars<00:01:19.890> off

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I think I've cut a hundred dollars off

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.219 
I think I've cut a hundred dollars off
of<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:23.030> electric<00:01:24.030> bill<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.520> 14<00:01:27.229> kW

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
of my electric bill this is my 14 kW

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
of my electric bill this is my 14 kW
that<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> had<00:01:28.979> installed<00:01:30.079> that's<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.290> three

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that I had installed that's a three

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920 
that I had installed that's a three
hundred<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> thirty<00:01:32.070> gallon<00:01:32.579> tank<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
hundred and thirty gallon tank that I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.640 
hundred and thirty gallon tank that I
had<00:01:34.729> rented<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.180> local<00:01:36.509> gas<00:01:36.720> company<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
had rented from a local gas company and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
had rented from a local gas company and
in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> generator<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
in the generator the way that that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.929 
in the generator the way that that
generator<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> placed<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.040> intake<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
generator is placed the intake is on the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.830 
generator is placed the intake is on the
right<00:01:42.150> side<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:44.430> exhaust<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> left

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
right side the exhaust is on the left

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130 
right side the exhaust is on the left
side<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.939> when<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.060> generator<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.659> run<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
side so when that generator would run it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.030 
side so when that generator would run it
would<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.439> exhaust<00:01:50.479> under<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> steps

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
would actually exhaust under the steps

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.649 
would actually exhaust under the steps
between<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.399> pool<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> house<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
between the pool and the house and I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.609 
between the pool and the house and I
could<00:01:54.720> hear<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:57.290> than<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> way<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
could hear it a lot more than the way I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.060 
could hear it a lot more than the way I
have<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> 22<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> 22<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.540> installed

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
have the 22 put in the 22 is installed

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.090 
have the 22 put in the 22 is installed
so<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> exhaust<00:02:02.670> vents<00:02:03.740> away<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so that the exhaust vents away from the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
so that the exhaust vents away from the
house<00:02:05.219> away<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> deck<00:02:06.180> toward<00:02:06.540> further

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
house away from the deck toward further

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
house away from the deck toward further
down<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> backyard<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.190> bit

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
down the backyard and it's a little bit

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.200 
down the backyard and it's a little bit
quieter<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.030> way

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

now<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.270> transfer<00:02:14.840> switch<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.660> 14<00:02:18.350> kW<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
now the transfer switch on the 14 kW it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.660 
now the transfer switch on the 14 kW it
was<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.440> 14<00:02:21.950> circuit<00:02:22.840> transfer<00:02:23.840> switch

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
was a 14 circuit transfer switch

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.720 
was a 14 circuit transfer switch

you from overloading your generator and

that's per code that's the rent to tank

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.020 
that's per code that's the rent to tank
and<00:04:39.980> then<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.160> new<00:04:40.310> tank<00:04:40.610> could<00:04:40.760> have<00:04:40.850> bought

and then the new tank could have bought

and then the new tank could have bought
it<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.300> actually<00:04:41.690> difficult<00:04:42.320> for<00:04:42.470> me<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.650> find

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
it was actually difficult for me to find

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.740 
it was actually difficult for me to find
a<00:04:43.310> tank<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.389> buy<00:04:44.889> they<00:04:45.889> used<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.280> sell<00:04:46.520> them<00:04:46.750> but

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
a tank to buy they used to sell them but

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.470 
a tank to buy they used to sell them but
there<00:04:48.440> was<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> huge<00:04:48.919> shortage<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.639> couple<00:04:50.360> of

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
there was a huge shortage a couple of

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.710 
there was a huge shortage a couple of
years<00:04:50.660> ago<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.110> was<00:04:51.260> hard<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.650> get<00:04:51.770> propane<00:04:52.310> and

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
years ago it was hard to get propane and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.400 
years ago it was hard to get propane and
most<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.080> local<00:04:54.260> suppliers<00:04:56.080> were<00:04:57.080> holding

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
most of the local suppliers were holding

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.780 
most of the local suppliers were holding
on<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.710> theirs<00:04:57.889> they<00:04:58.100> weren't<00:04:58.340> selling<00:04:58.520> them

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
on to theirs they weren't selling them

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:07.000 
on to theirs they weren't selling them
anymore<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:04.310> that's<00:05:04.520> my<00:05:04.820> 22<00:05:05.750> kW<00:05:06.380> install<00:05:06.770> if
