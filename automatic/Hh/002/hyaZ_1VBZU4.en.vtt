00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello in this first video tutorial os 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 I'm going to teach how to unlock our 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:17.789
 iphone with an iave card is very easy 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:19.619
 and very simple to unlock our 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 iphone what we need will be a 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.529
 card carry and an iphone blocked for 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.869
 a different company to which we 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 we want to insert a sim card is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.399
 say this iphone would be blocked in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.590
 a principle to movistar but with the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.510
 introduction of the card carry the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 we would block to be able to use with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
 any operator the first thing that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 we must do is match our 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.239
 iave card and its requirements with the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 of the phone that we can check 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 in general settings 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 a second general information and here 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.320
 would tell us our version that is mine 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 in my case it would be 43 points 1 and our 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 firmware that would be 4 1001 this would be the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 ideal to introduce the iave card 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.450
 that I have here for an iphone 4s what 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.250
 better would be to look for an iave card 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.610
 specifically for that version and those 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 they go in at the moment we have to already we 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.680
 matches we just have to catch the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.170
 iave card and incorporate our 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.149
 card that we want to use the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.580
 operator in this case of vodafone already 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.130
 clipped we just have to enter it 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.320
 through the side hole of our 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.560
 iphone 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.120
 which will cost more than normal to enter 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 because having another card underneath 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.220
 what would it be to carry them 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.710
 would be bigger simply the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.680
 we introduce and we should leave a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.020
 message unlock the pin code 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.229
 well we unlock it we introduce 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 pin code quickly and we press ok 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.259
 we waited a few seconds and should 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.079
 disappear once it disappears we 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.569
 should a monthly come back to us 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.510
 say unlock we quickly put the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.880
 pin code we press ok and in the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.590
 moment disappear this should we 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.740
 leave a message with instructions 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.270
 that I will tell you quickly 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.270
 we wait for it to disappear 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 well once they disappear do not leave 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.980
 instructions we simply will 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.590
 We accept and we do the following 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.290
 We hope that between coverage 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.750
 our iphone that is about to 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.269
 enter will come a line we have 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.780
 coverage then we make the call of 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:52.250
 emergency to 112 and we expect some 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.549
 12 seconds is fine we can already hang 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.980
 hang up and we're going to adjust 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:03.620
 quickly adjust and we put flight mode 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.410
 quickly once put into flight mode 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.040
 we'll just have to wait 30 seconds 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.709
 so that we get 22 notifications 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.099
 that will tell us that he is already released 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.510
 our iphone we just have to wait 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.010
 30 seconds 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 you will also ask me where is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.299
 can get the cards then 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 we can buy them in a thousand ads 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.299
 they sell a lot and in also second 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.519
 good hand or ebay have already left the two 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.769
 notifications we hope and brings us the 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.240
 unlock unlock 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.710
 pin code 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.710
 we press ok 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.340
 and in the moment we disappear already 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.500
 we should take coverage with 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.959
 our operator of that water for example 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.380
 I already have coverage with vodafone and the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.010
 coverage here we have it already has 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.129
 come out with what I could do 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 any call I even have 3g already 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.090
 as here we can see there I have 3 g 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.519
 good 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.870
 Having said that, I hope you liked a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.640
 tutorial a bit quick but good 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.070
 as we go freeing the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.299
 phone we will be taking skill a 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.299
 greeting and until another
