00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.779
 how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.779
 I will show you how to change the 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.779
 screen of a motorcycle gp x 10 32 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.119
 first and most important there is that 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.789
 get the spare as you will see me 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.300
 I bought one that costs around 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.310
 40 or 50 dollars buying it for a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.250
 internal page so we will be a 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.619
 tor t5 historian who can 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.800
 get a low cost online 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.320
 we also need a spatula 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.420
 metal or any tool 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.420
 opening as can be a pick or a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.610
 credit card sometimes you are 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.920
 tools can come with the purchase 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.289
 of spare parts now we can start 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.539
 you have to disarm the team I now what 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.300
 I will do in fast camera because I already have a 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.730
 video of how he disassembled motorola moto gp and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.499
 I recommend them to see it and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.499
 I will leave below in the description 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 do not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.549
 the device has not stayed that way 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.549
 we remove the main board of the equipment 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.549
 disconnect 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.590
 the flex of the module 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.330
 very well and now if we remove the plate 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.950
 this always always very carefully that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.950
 it's stuck 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 very well will remove the plate on this side 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.970
 we found a mesh now if we 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.130
 we are with the module but still we 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.470
 there is a small step before placing 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.500
 the new module very well here I have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.310
 the two modules that little step that 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.760
 it is to pass the old man's things 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.270
 module to the new thing that things for example the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.370
 speaker making calls we withdrew 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.959
 agrees in this part of the back but the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.210
 prevention out there and we'll put it in the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.760
 new module 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.360
 if born in this step they will not be able to be 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360
 calls 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 and we have this rubber band below 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.390
 always in the same way I was in 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.720
 the other once this step is done 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.760
 we will proceed to assemble the phone first 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.760
 we will put this metal mesh 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.370
 in this way 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.709
 next we will put the plate 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 and now we will connect the flex 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.900
 of the module that we just put 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.690
 that / has to be the white line to the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.690
 golden line have to match well 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.020
 we go down 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.990
 then we put this protection 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.810
 blue 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.400
 Y 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.260
 we will continue that the battery that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.260
 connect here below 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:29.969
 we will proceed to place the buttons 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:38.810
 and now the volume up and down volume 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.810
 very well 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.110
 and the part of the back shell 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.790
 this has to enter perfectly 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.590
 if it's not because something has been wrong or 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.030
 there is some problem and he remonstrated 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.030
 open it and look 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.330
 once it is like this we will not put them 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.210
 still the screws and we'll light the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.790
 team to see verify that the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.780
 walk and walk well as you can 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.510
 see if the perfection module now 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.630
 the only thing about you is to put back the 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.280
 screws the lid and it would be ready this 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.710
 it has been all the video I hope that you 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.750
 have liked and served if they do not forget 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.090
 to like and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.160
 to see more videos they can also 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.470
 share it with your friends so that it 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.130
 encouraged to do so and see you next 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.130
