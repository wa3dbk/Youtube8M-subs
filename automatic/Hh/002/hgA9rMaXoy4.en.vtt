00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.260 

okay<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> trial<00:00:02.010> run<00:00:02.310> just<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.850> see<00:00:03.060> how

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
okay this is a trial run just to see how

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay this is a trial run just to see how
well<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:04.910> this<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.120> recording<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
well this is this is recording and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.350 
well this is this is recording and
whether<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.040> clear<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> try

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
whether it's clear so I'm going to try

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:23.290 
whether it's clear so I'm going to try
turning<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.929> computer

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:47.740 

and<00:00:23.720> there<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.289> noise

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.520 

like<00:00:48.289> frankly<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.980> sounds<00:00:49.219> like<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:50.530> that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
like frankly it sounds like the that

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.390 
like frankly it sounds like the that
this<00:00:51.829> is<00:00:51.890> what's<00:00:52.370> making<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.940> noise

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
this is what's making the noise

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.460 
this is what's making the noise
I<00:00:54.520> feel<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.150> vibration<00:00:55.900> here<00:00:56.110> on<00:00:56.260> my<00:00:56.410> finger

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
I feel the vibration here on my finger

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.840 
I feel the vibration here on my finger
and<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.680> fact<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:01.170> video<00:01:02.170> card<00:01:02.850> but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and that is in fact the video card but

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.030 
and that is in fact the video card but
there<00:01:04.030> are<00:01:04.090> no<00:01:04.240> wires<00:01:04.570> underneath<00:01:05.350> there<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
there are no wires underneath there so

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
there are no wires underneath there so
we're<00:01:12.250> reaching<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.790> point<00:01:12.820> where<00:01:13.090> it's<00:01:13.450> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
we're reaching the point where it's just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.060 
we're reaching the point where it's just
about<00:01:16.330> ready<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.840> boot<00:01:17.080> up<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:17.560> normally<00:01:17.950> it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
about ready to boot up and normally it

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.000 
about ready to boot up and normally it
stops<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.780> clicking<00:01:22.780> after<00:01:23.230> it<00:01:23.320> gets<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.860> this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
stops the clicking after it gets to this

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:37.969 
stops the clicking after it gets to this
point<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.750> when<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:28.990> login

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:49.639 

I<00:01:44.539> believe<00:01:45.539> that<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.049> probably<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:48.649> video

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I believe that it's probably the video

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.590 
I believe that it's probably the video
card<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> making<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.630> noise<00:01:53.600> there's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
card that is making the noise there's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.120 
card that is making the noise there's
the<00:01:54.960> view<00:01:55.340> as<00:01:56.340> best<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the view as best I can do it of the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.000 
the view as best I can do it of the
video<00:01:59.399> car<00:02:00.740> at<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> bottom<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> video<00:02:02.520> car
