00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.170
 yes 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.550
 to start I love being this base 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.560
 from sisi cream de just your and I always 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.169
 I apply it with my fingers but today I am 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.029
 using my brush to not stain me 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.590
 hands because I'm really not so 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.590
 careful and I have a white blouse 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.100
 Y 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.570
 and now I'm going to apply this first of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 alina pierre to ensure that my base 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.690
 stay in place and cute and cool 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 during the day 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 if they want more skin coverage what 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.540
 the best they can do is get 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.670
 samples like these that I have of alima 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.810
 pierre at this time for my color 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.280
 perfect 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 I am a combination of two different 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.640
 colors that is golden number 8 and golden 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.040
 number 9 and I really love this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.380
 base because it is powder is very light 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.110
 and it does not look like I have a lot of 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.610
 Make up my face and my skin looks 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.610
 natural good with this base 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 on the sides of my nose I like to use 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 a color a little darker to 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 refine my nose a little 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:17.480
 I will also use my concealer to 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:02:20.980
 cover these horrible dark circles and now what 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.980
 see what a difference 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.629
 and I have to use my favorite group the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.720
 of the moment that is this of just your and 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.430
 it's in an organic clubbing color that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:49.870
 love this color because it has a 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:51.730
 shine and it looks very cute on the skin for 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.709
 my eyes I will use two colors of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 charkh the lighter one or I'll apply it 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:06.040
 in the area tears of my eyes to give 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:08.220
 a little more brightness with this color that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.359
 it's the darkest I'm going to apply 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.000
 precisely in the crease of the eyes 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.580
 to add a little more definition and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.680
 then I will discriminate 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.610
 and he also applied the same color 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.610
 under the eyes 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.050
 and now as always we are going to blur 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.050
 the color very well 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.810
 and now with this clear color I'm going 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 to apply under my eyebrows 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.680
 since he finished with his eyes I can 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.959
 apply my mask and mask that almost 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.540
 always use is one of my favorites 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.239
 steptoe and this I love because it makes 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.810
 that my eyelashes look fatter and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:14.620
 blacker and longer because mine 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:19.239
 naturally they are very short already they see 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.519
 because I love it so much I love it 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.290
 add a bit of brightness on the bridge 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.990
 from my nose to add a little more 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.330
 definition with this blog you can 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.190
 use any lipstick they want but 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.260
 I'm going to use one that's very simple and pink and 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.470
 this is the final look I hope you 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.530

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.060
