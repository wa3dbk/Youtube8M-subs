my<00:02:28.380> favorite<00:02:28.920> curling<00:02:37.010> I'll<00:02:38.010> come<00:02:38.220> out<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
my favorite curling I'll come out and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.250 
my favorite curling I'll come out and
look<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.360> it'll<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.690> really

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
look like this so it'll just be really

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.000 
look like this so it'll just be really
loose<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.460> soft<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
loose and soft and pretty and then I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.100 
loose and soft and pretty and then I
also<00:02:44.190> said<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.670> straighten<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.050> if

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
also said you can straighten it so if

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.380 
also said you can straighten it so if
you<00:02:46.230> straighten<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.740> with<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> bend<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:48.240> can

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you straighten it with a bend you can

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.950 
you straighten it with a bend you can
just<00:02:48.600> use<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.960> like<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.180> then<00:02:51.180> Bend<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
just use it like this and then Bend the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.370 
just use it like this and then Bend the
end<00:02:53.810> strain<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.730> bend<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.510> end

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.960 

so<00:03:01.380> these<00:03:01.710> are<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.950> two<00:03:02.100> options<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.820> one

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so these are the two options for a one

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.560 
so these are the two options for a one
and<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> quarter<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> half<00:03:05.570> another

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
and a quarter or one and a half another

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.780 
and a quarter or one and a half another
iron<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.960> try<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.260> these<00:03:07.380> curling<00:03:07.830> wands<00:03:08.280> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
iron to try are these curling wands so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.920 
iron to try are these curling wands so
these<00:03:08.880> curling<00:03:09.270> wands<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.720> use<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
these curling wands are what you use to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
these curling wands are what you use to
get<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.290> beach<00:03:10.590> wave<00:03:10.860> these<00:03:11.370> are<00:03:11.520> really

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
get that beach wave these are really

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.160 
get that beach wave these are really
great<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.300> don't<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.720> clamp<00:03:12.960> on

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
great because they don't have a clamp on

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.570 
great because they don't have a clamp on
them<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.740> just<00:03:13.920> wrap<00:03:14.160> your<00:03:14.190> hair<00:03:14.550> around

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
them so you just wrap your hair around

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.670 
them so you just wrap your hair around
the<00:03:14.880> outside<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.600> there's<00:03:16.140> two<00:03:16.290> ways<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.470> can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the outside so there's two ways you can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.370 
the outside so there's two ways you can
use<00:03:16.740> this<00:03:17.100> using<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.730> size<00:03:17.970> curling<00:03:18.390> one<00:03:18.540> one

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
use this using this size curling one one

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.320 
use this using this size curling one one
way<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:20.010> wrap<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.220> really<00:03:20.550> tight<00:03:20.670> like

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
way is if you wrap it really tight like

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.710 
way is if you wrap it really tight like
this<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.770> hair<00:03:23.640> right<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.150> top<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.570> each

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this with the hair right on top of each

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.840 
this with the hair right on top of each
other<00:03:24.960> it<00:03:25.200> makes<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.590> tighter<00:03:25.890> curl<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.520> then

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
other it makes a tighter curl and then

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.070 
other it makes a tighter curl and then
there's<00:03:27.000> another<00:03:27.090> way<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.810> which

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
there's another way you can do it which

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.420 
there's another way you can do it which
is<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.560> looser<00:03:28.860> which<00:03:28.980> gets<00:03:29.280> you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
is a little bit looser which gets you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.750 
is a little bit looser which gets you
that<00:03:29.610> even<00:03:30.240> more<00:03:30.420> beachy<00:03:30.960> hair<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.370> hold

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
that even more beachy hair so just hold

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.130 
that even more beachy hair so just hold
this<00:03:32.850> like<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> few<00:03:33.630> seconds<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
this like this for a few seconds and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.550 
this like this for a few seconds and
keep<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> end<00:03:34.590> straight<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:36.320> then<00:03:37.320> let<00:03:37.530> go

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
keep the end straight and then let go

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.840 
keep the end straight and then let go
and<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:40.440> curl<00:03:40.650> looks<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.280> which<00:03:41.820> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
and the curl looks like this which is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.640 
and the curl looks like this which is
pretty<00:03:42.150> curly<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.440> there's<00:03:43.590> another

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
pretty curly and then there's another

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.440 
pretty curly and then there's another
way<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.340> that's<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.670> beach<00:03:44.970> way<00:03:45.240> that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
way to do it that's the beach way that

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.330 
way to do it that's the beach way that
you're<00:03:45.570> looking<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.160> really

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
you're looking for and this is really

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.640 
you're looking for and this is really
effortless<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:48.180> great<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.900> dirty<00:03:49.170> hair<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
effortless and great on dirty hair and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.010 
effortless and great on dirty hair and
that's<00:03:49.950> wrapping<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.550> around<00:03:50.610> loosely<00:03:51.540> so

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
that's wrapping it around loosely so

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.960 
that's wrapping it around loosely so
when<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.200> wrap<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.650> way<00:03:52.860> instead<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.400> on

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
when you wrap it this way instead of on

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.430 
when you wrap it this way instead of on
top<00:03:54.270> of<00:03:54.450> each<00:03:54.570> other<00:03:54.720> like<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.110> you're<00:03:55.410> just

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
top of each other like this you're just

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.270 
top of each other like this you're just
leaving<00:03:56.310> some<00:03:56.730> space<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.230> kind<00:03:59.220> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
leaving some space like this and kind of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.610 
leaving some space like this and kind of
curling<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.790> at<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> diagonal<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.900> that'll

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
curling it at a diagonal and that'll

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.960 
curling it at a diagonal and that'll
give<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.010> Beach<00:04:02.250> wave<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.790> can

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
give you that Beach wave that you can

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.160 
give you that Beach wave that you can
get<00:04:03.209> with<00:04:03.480> any<00:04:03.720> curling<00:04:04.410> one

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.470 
get with any curling one
and<00:04:05.470> then<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.710> leave<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.190> like<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.670> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
and then you leave that like that it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.230 
and then you leave that like that it
just<00:04:07.690> gets<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.230> nice<00:04:08.650> soft<00:04:09.100> wave<00:04:09.459> so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
just gets you this nice soft wave so

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.600 
just gets you this nice soft wave so
this<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.810> tight<00:04:11.290> curl<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.370> loose

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
this is the tight curl and the loose

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.420 
this is the tight curl and the loose
curl<00:04:13.000> both<00:04:13.270> using<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.840> curly<00:04:14.140> one<00:04:14.319> so<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.340> is

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
curl both using the curly one so this is

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.920 
curl both using the curly one so this is
the<00:04:15.520> same<00:04:15.730> curling<00:04:16.060> wand<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.390> just<00:04:16.690> showed<00:04:16.900> you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
the same curling wand I just showed you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.870 
the same curling wand I just showed you
just<00:04:17.290> in<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.560> bigger<00:04:17.769> size<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.489> curl<00:04:18.730> will

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
just in a bigger size so the curl will

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.599 
just in a bigger size so the curl will
be<00:04:18.970> even<00:04:19.239> looser<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.829> first<00:04:21.220> I'll<00:04:21.430> show<00:04:21.459> you

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
be even looser so first I'll show you

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.240 
be even looser so first I'll show you
that<00:04:21.850> same<00:04:22.090> tight<00:04:22.450> wave<00:04:22.720> which<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.010> hair

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
that same tight wave which is the hair

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.190 
that same tight wave which is the hair
on<00:04:24.430> top<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.180> each<00:04:25.300> other<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.990> hold

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
on top of each other and you just hold

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.770 
on top of each other and you just hold
it<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.500> few<00:04:29.590> seconds<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.550> let<00:04:31.270> go<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.660> this

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
it for a few seconds and let go so this

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.240 
it for a few seconds and let go so this
will<00:04:31.960> be<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.350> tighter<00:04:33.240> wave<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.680> with<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.860> bigger

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
will be a tighter wave but with a bigger

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.710 
will be a tighter wave but with a bigger
one<00:04:37.740> which<00:04:38.740> will<00:04:38.919> look<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.850> then

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
one which will look like this and then

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.340 
one which will look like this and then
this<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.919> looser<00:04:42.430> wave<00:04:43.020> with<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> same

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
this is the looser wave with the same

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.409 
this is the looser wave with the same
curl<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.620> showed<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.950> before<00:04:45.100> by<00:04:45.700> curling<00:04:46.180> it

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
curl I showed you before by curling it

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.230 
curl I showed you before by curling it
leaving<00:04:47.320> space<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:47.950> between<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.340> diagonally

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
leaving space in between and diagonally

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.450 
leaving space in between and diagonally
so<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.169> is<00:04:50.320> more<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.680> each<00:04:50.950> wave<00:04:51.250> you're

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
so this is more of that each wave you're

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.300 
so this is more of that each wave you're
looking<00:04:51.700> for<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:53.560> again<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:54.040> holding<00:04:54.280> it

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
looking for and again just holding it

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.700 
looking for and again just holding it
for<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.520> few<00:04:54.730> seconds<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.240> let<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.480> go<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:58.710> this

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
for a few seconds and let it go so this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.409 
for a few seconds and let it go so this
is<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.950> difference<00:05:00.220> between<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.970> bigger

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
is the difference between the bigger

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.150 
is the difference between the bigger
curling<00:05:01.900> wand<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.440> smaller<00:05:02.770> curling

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
curling wand and the smaller curling

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.850 
curling wand and the smaller curling
wand<00:05:03.370> so<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:03.790> is<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.750> tight<00:05:05.020> wave<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
wand so this is the tight wave and the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.370 
wand so this is the tight wave and the
beach<00:05:06.010> wave

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
beach wave

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.629 
beach wave
