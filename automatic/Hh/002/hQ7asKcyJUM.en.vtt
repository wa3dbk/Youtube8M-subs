00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.030 
have two minutes per each round and I
only<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> 21<00:01:58.110> seconds<00:01:58.439> left<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
only have 21 seconds left because if you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.789 
only have 21 seconds left because if you
join<00:01:59.310> late<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.960> won't<00:02:01.140> get<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> time<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
join late you won't get all the time of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469 
join late you won't get all the time of
course

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.380 

so<00:02:08.479> there<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.720> go<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.200> are<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.240> hear

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so there you go and are so you can hear

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.510 
so there you go and are so you can hear
that<00:02:14.540> timer<00:02:15.020> means<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.530> time<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.220> running<00:02:16.430> up

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
that timer means that time is running up

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.800 
that timer means that time is running up
and<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:18.080> round<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.380> over<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.420> course<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.690> was

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and the round is over so of course I was

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.080 
and the round is over so of course I was
a<00:02:20.840> horrible<00:02:21.230> round<00:02:21.560> because<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.730> gonna<00:02:22.910> say

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
a horrible round because I'm gonna say

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.220 
a horrible round because I'm gonna say
it<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.240> because<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.450> was<00:02:23.510> forcing<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.960> Esme

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
it was because I was forcing to Esme

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.720 
it was because I was forcing to Esme
because<00:02:24.440> i<00:02:24.500> suck<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.190> anyways<00:02:25.430> once<00:02:25.550> you're

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
because i suck so anyways once you're

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.250 
because i suck so anyways once you're
done<00:02:25.850> you'll<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> words<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.930> found

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
done you'll see the words that you found

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.200 
done you'll see the words that you found
you<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:27.860> single<00:02:28.190> snaps<00:02:28.430> or<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.850> have<00:02:28.940> multi

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
you have single snaps or you have multi

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.900 
you have single snaps or you have multi
snaps<00:02:29.450> which<00:02:29.630> used<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:30.080> seven<00:02:30.290> tiles<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.010> you

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
snaps which used all seven tiles and you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.700 
snaps which used all seven tiles and you
can<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.240> how<00:02:32.390> much<00:02:32.540> each<00:02:32.750> snap<00:02:33.080> was<00:02:33.260> worth<00:02:33.440> if

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
can see how much each snap was worth if

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.200 
can see how much each snap was worth if
you<00:02:34.160> slide<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.550> right<00:02:34.700> you'll<00:02:34.850> see<00:02:34.910> what

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
right next to each other to create two

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.910 
right next to each other to create two
words<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.520> if<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.740> it'll<00:02:48.740> show

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
or facebook or whatever let's try it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.150 
or facebook or whatever let's try it
again<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.840> i<00:03:14.900> could<00:03:15.080> see<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:16.489> i<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.180> get<00:03:18.160> know

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
again so i could see and i can get know

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.830 
again so i could see and i can get know
how<00:03:19.790> does<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.000> work<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:22.239> can<00:03:23.239> get<00:03:23.450> has<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:26.600> course

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
how does it work I can get has of course

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.390 
how does it work I can get has of course
you're<00:03:27.019> trying<00:03:27.320> you<00:03:27.500> should<00:03:27.709> try<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:27.980> get

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
you're trying you should try to get

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.220 
you're trying you should try to get
larger<00:03:28.880> words<00:03:29.090> with<00:03:29.390> which<00:03:29.810> are<00:03:29.959> obviously

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
larger words with which are obviously

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.840 
larger words with which are obviously
going<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.620> be<00:03:30.739> worth<00:03:30.920> more<00:03:31.190> points<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.730> if<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
going to be worth more points and if you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.910 
going to be worth more points and if you
use<00:03:32.060> obscure<00:03:32.870> letters<00:03:33.170> you'll<00:03:33.410> get<00:03:33.530> even<00:03:33.769> more

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
use obscure letters you'll get even more

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.590 
use obscure letters you'll get even more
points<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.430> it's<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.790> about<00:03:34.820> choosing<00:03:35.450> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
points so it's all about choosing the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.880 
points so it's all about choosing the
proper<00:03:35.900> words<00:03:36.080> finding<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.530> proper

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
proper words finding the proper

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.500 
proper words finding the proper
combination<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.640> just<00:03:37.790> being<00:03:37.970> really<00:03:38.239> fast

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
combination and just being really fast

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.120 
combination and just being really fast
with<00:03:39.080> your<00:03:39.200> fingers<00:03:39.530> which<00:03:39.799> I'm<00:03:40.100> currently
