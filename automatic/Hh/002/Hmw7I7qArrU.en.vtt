00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.230
 The neighboring clinic of olive groves in Granada 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:14.030
 and from www.twitter.com today well 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.610
 let's dedicate this video to talk about 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.349
 an issue that is topical because the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.689
 time when we are already going 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.269
 approaching spring and up the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.070
 temperature with which we started to see 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.560
 that parasites begin to proliferate 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.650
 external external parasites always 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.900
 have been and are and will be a threat to 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.960
 our animals even for us 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.760
 in this good time because I already say that 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.430
 they start to find their temperature 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.780
 optimal for development and we already have 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 than having our animals so much 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.019
 dogs like cats prepared for 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.690
 defend against the attack of these 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.580
 parasites in our area here we talk 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.670
 for the concrete of the Mediterranean area 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.670
 from europe we find the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.320
 especially the presence of fleas ticks 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.750
 and mosquitoes both transmitters of 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.269
 leishmania as transmitters for example 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 of that of heartworm in the in the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.479
 case of dogs and cats 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.750
 and above all it will be our horse of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.820
 battle the fight against this kind of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 parasites that we can do well 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210
 We can treat our dogs 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.440
 prevent by good then a series 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.979
 of products that are available 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.780
 that will always be important this be 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.909
 the veterinarian to tell us which one is going to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.140
 be the most appropriate for each case we will 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 to find products that can be 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.970
 apply at the skin level so fit 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.320
 of necklace in the form of pipettes is button 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.050
 in the form of sprayers as bathrooms or 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.520
 like the use of shampoos we can also 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.429
 have the products that act in a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.940
 systemic with the group tail of the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.520
 oral administration of medications 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 and this form of administration is I say 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 both technically at a systemic level 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 is going to be the veterinarian who tells us 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 exactly how should we owe which one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 should this product we should use 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 why because there's going to be a great 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.750
 variability in terms of animals 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.479
 well for the kind of animal both dog 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
 like cat the hair type if there is any 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.710
 dermatological problem the character of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.080
 that animal now I'm going to administer 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.610
 some kind of product and I always have 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.590
 than to use one that we know is going to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.540
 be completely effective in our in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.250
 our animal and of course the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 product that is to apply in a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.220
 dog that we apply it on a dog in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.140
 which is to apply a cat that is 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.330
 apply on a cat because good we have already 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.530
 spoken in previous videos of the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.900
 poisoning problems that are 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.670
 can present for good then the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.020
 Product ingestion or swallowing or 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.180
 the absorption through the skin of 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.950
 antiparasitic products especially if 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.780
 they are not prepared for the specials 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 what we are using this is very 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.170
 important particularly in the case of 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 the cats that are going to be most sensitive to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.020
 this type of disorders 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.940
 know also that you should not wait 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.260
 as has always been bred to reach the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.959
 summer that the heat is already established 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.069
 to start preventing the presence of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.200
 these external parasites our 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.050
 animals but you have to act from 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 before they are already protected 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.819
 parasites have a temperature range 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.580
 that especially like the temperature 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.290
 tempered the spring of autumn and they go to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.569
 run away from the low temperatures 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.190
 as of the high temperatures then 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.410
 it's going to be spring and autumn 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.000
 months that happens will favor the one 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.880
 be in these parasites in the environment 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.530
 but with the usual climate change 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.690
 and the stations are not so marked 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 and we find that these fans 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.709
 they open and there actually a couple of 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.049
 months maybe the year we can 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.819
 consider ourselves safe from danger 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.640
 but that will also vary depending 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.370
 of each year because in this there is no 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.230
 a very strict control of this from that of 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.180
 the seasons then what do we do 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.360
 we from the clinic are already 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.829
 advising people to use the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.019
 anti-parasitic products throughout 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.549
 all year round because to be waiting 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.830
 one or two months those that maybe not 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.380
 there is risk many times we can pass 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.610
 of time and if we already put the point 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.770
 antiparasitic when our animal 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.780
 it's good for zizou has suffered 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.400
 initiation a parasitation and then 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have the problem there and now 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.710
 we have to prevent it but to treat the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.540
 disease ticks or fleas 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.160
 mosquitoes are going to transmit a series of 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.600
 diseases to our animals like 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.100
 they can be type problems or they're going to 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.750
 cause allergic-type problems in the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.910
 skin like in allergic dermatitis the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.650
 flea bite let's find us 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.900
 with infectious processes we are going to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.520
 find with chose if we are not going to 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.110
 find papers with me yes and we go 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.090
 to find a duck zoonosis too 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.310
 let's find with leishmaniasis with 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.440
 the dirofilariosis then are a series 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.260
 of diseases that are quite serious 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.180
 and sometimes they lead to the death of 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.860
 affected animal and you also have to have 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.600
 note that many of them are 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.120
 human and it means that we can 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.420
 also acquire them people 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.920
 then treating our dog for 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.020
 prevent parasite tests 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.030
 external resources will also favor our 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.470
 protection against those parasites that 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.900
 They can also transmit to us 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.750
 these diseases remember what 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.389
 the prevention against parasites 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.940
 external parasitic is a pillar 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.949
 fundamental in the health of our 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.210
 pets maybe you are not given the 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.650
 importance that the subject requires but 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.720
 it's going to be the external parasites that 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.009
 originate many of the processes 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.810
 infectious diseases that our 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.160
 animals and some will be 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.470
 underdiagnosed because I do not know 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.830
 manifest with a sharp picture but that 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.389
 it's a chronic subclinical process that 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.940
 can have the animal in a bad 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.820
 condition of life and that maybe 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.680
 we do not give importance to the process that 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.900
 Suffer and therefore not for being animal even 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.960
 come to die without us knowing what it is 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.610
 what was there in the middle then I tell you 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.250
 that we should not neglect this for 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.350
 external situation and good what 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.180
 we do is important I already say in the 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.460
 application of these products and how 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.599
 we can notice that our dog suffers 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.789
 any of the diseases transmitted 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.729
 as for these these good parasites 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.410
 because in some cases I say that is 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.240
 presented his clinics in the 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.979
 that maybe you notice something of a little 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.040
 of apathy for a few days but I do not know 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.110
 comes to appreciate one thing in particular 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.090
 the cases if you can manifest with 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.670
 fever processes can manifest 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.490
 with anorexia dejection dementia 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.280
 the cat dog can be shown with 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.100
 joint pain and you will get problems 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.530
 ocular problems at vascular level 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.850
 there appears a weakness of the geese and 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.950
 hemorrhages appear frequently 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.530
 hemorrhagic problems due to problems 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.690
 level of platelets Thrombocytopenia 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.010
 for example then there may be 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.690
 also kidney affectations 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.270
 affectations and even of heart 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.160
 then I say that the wide range 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.170
 of symptoms that there are good can 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.430
 encompass many diseases but not 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.830
 we must forget those who also 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.830
 can be in this medium then yes 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.630
 we do not see our dog having a 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.530
 visible rating because we see that 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.010
 he has fleas 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.410
 we see that he has ticks and let's see 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.540
 if we do not tell you that a few days ago 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.170
 we had this face for perhaps some fleas 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.850
 Well, we can be hiding a Europe 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.220
 they are very valuable information that is going to 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.680
 serve to quickly catch that 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.780
 disease by means and being able to treat it 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.969
 without causing major problem for us and 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.239
 I say remember that it is important that 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.319
 let's not start to start 

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:19.169
 prevent it to these parasites in our 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.999
 dogs and cats and make it a thing that 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.339
 let's take it to the letter and form 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:25.679
 constant throughout the year if 

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:28.469
 is if possible always in consultation with 

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:29.939
 your vet to advise you 

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:31.619
 about which product is best 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:33.029
 adapt to your animal can 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.439
 transform you already know that you have 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:35.789
 your disposition the telephone of 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.059
 query that appears on our page 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:40.589
 www point your vet point info and 

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:42.029
 there good because we are delighted
