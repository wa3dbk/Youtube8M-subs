 life or want to start the

 lifestyle q say or do not know that 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.210
 eating this raw vegan diet is 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.339
 specifically the diet 80 10 10 and the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.989
 doctor and you're clan wrote a book 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.879
 that I will also leave the link 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.140
 down where you can find more 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.360
 information this diet is based on 80% 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 of your food comes from carbohydrates 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.220
 simple that in this case comes the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.320
 fruit 10 percent protein that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.570
 it comes from all the fruit and all the vegetables 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.960
 but specifically the greens are the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.360
 which are higher in protein and 10% 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.300
 grease 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.480
 that comes from avocado coconut meat 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.570
 nuts and seeds then today I'm going to 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:37.670
 teach what I normally like in a 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.640
 daily day and then we will start good 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.850
 first of all I start all the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.570
 mornings with water either a liter of water 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.520
 a first of water as soon as I get up 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 so I always have not fixed my 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.590
 bed because what happens is that all the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.440
 night our body becomes dehydrated 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.300
 we sweat and apart as we spend many 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.490
 hours without drinking water then it's very 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.009
 important to moisturize as soon as 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 pick up and here on my channel I have a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.119
 video of fruit waters and 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.489
 detoxifying in case you do not like the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.950
 water you put a fruit and you know more 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.640
 rich with more vitamins and is a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.400
 excellent way to drink more water 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.170
 the second my mornings I always like 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.930
 that are a little lighter 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.840
 so normally I do not take something 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 as very heavy and I choose fruits that are 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 higher in water content the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.520
 citrus is a very good option and right now 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.420
 this season citrus 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.820
 we are in winter I make my played for 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.000
 the constipation that I'm going to leave the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.290
 video recipe down here too and 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.010
 is 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.510
 super rich refreshing and they are usually 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.390
 about 32 ounces of this juice this is 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.640
 my breakfast and I try to do activity 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 physical every day and usually 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.459
 in the morning then I drink the juice at 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.170
 exercise and then already at the time of 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.859
 food today touches a hearty dish of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650
 fruits 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.540
 ricky yes yes yes we wanted and right now 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.209
 fruit that is more seasonal that more 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.480
 in is so much -ha are not the apples the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.500
 pears the grapes are well rich in 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.269
 banana the pomegranate and here you can see a 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.819
 delicious fruit dish and consumption 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.299
 of half would pay every day when 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.669
 something more exercise like more and with no 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.609
 I exercise as much as less and 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:43.280
 it is also very important to include greens 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.169
 in your meals at noon too 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 then I usually like it 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.800
 accompany it with some romaine lettuces 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.590
 that these are 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.500
 now I am not the healthy ones and less 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.370
 as solitas something that I like to do is 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:04.310
 that I grab a little arm of everything so I grab 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:07.250

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.050
 little bit of everything I put here my lettuce 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.270
 Roman and I like to put a little bit of 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.510
 date candy they know that the 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.290
 I have a recipe on my channel 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.730
 banana hand and so I do nothing 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.730
 everything like in a mini taquito 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.479
 fast fruit and 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.530
 singh 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.110
 A) Yes 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.310
 is delicious is an excellent way 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.520
 to eat more green and we feel that 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.880
 taste if you do not like it at last 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.220
 and comes dinner and supper I love 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.040
 because for all this because I spent all 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.920
 day eating most food fruit 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.710
 then sweet and now I'm ready 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.560
 for some little more salty then 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.890
 what I do is that I start my food 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.900
 usually with some acid fruit and 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.669
 now being very in season 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.100
 tangerines then I love the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.040
 tangerines apart that are digested 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.620
 much easier with the vegetables that 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.980
 the sweet fruit then that's very 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.650
 important at night if you're going to combine 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.620
 Vegetables with fruit is very important 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.560
 consume fruit towards someone content 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.550
 of art then citrus fruits are very 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.260
 good choice and make me a salad like that 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.630
 huge delicious tomatoes 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.850
 they never miss in my salad you know that 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.520
 tomatoes are also very high in 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.290
 vitamin c and I put the truth of 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.320
 any mature woman who has in my house 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.390
 I really love jicama and I 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.410
 I also put red pepper or if I have 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.930
 zucchini or cucumber gave carrot 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.200
 everything of everything so you find in your 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.690
 you can put the salad box 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.630
 Sometimes something just a dressing based on 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.730
 pure lemon and avocado but right now 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.850
 is charming my dressing that I have to 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.300
 is and is based on zucchini with chili 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.650
 morron to be like picosito and salty 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.430
 It is very rich and I already put it on top of 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.100
 my salad and ready and basically this 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.250
 it's my food if during the day I feel 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.670
 more hungry because I like to eat 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.740
 between meals cucumber celery apples 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.690
 I also love apple trees for 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.180
 relationship cameras and bolt or wherever 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.820
 where I go and with the tangerines 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.889
 I like them a lot then this is what 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.310
 can 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.800
 in a normal day of the raw vegan diet 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.599
 and as you can see they are more 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.849
 great because fruits and vegetables are 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:08.479
 much lower in calories then it's 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:11.060
 important to eat these quantities I hope
