00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.059
 hello everyone I'm katyn and in the tutorial 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.550
 today we are going to learn how to make these 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.310
 little bows that are very well made 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.220
 with newspaper are very simple and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.660
 easy easy to make 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.700
 materials are very cheap 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.710
 before starting with the tutorial I 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.480
 I would like to ask you to follow me in 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.610
 social networks that you subscribe to me 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.629
 channel and also that if this video you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.980
 like that you give me are like and if 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.110
 you want to share it with a friend what 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.590
 you can also do if you want to see more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.040
 video on my blog you have many 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.940
 well now we started doing the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.940
 today's tutorial 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.010
 for this craft we're just going to 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.690
 need paper scissors brush structure 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 of our taste and glue 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.759
 so let's start now also 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.450
 make our Christmas the first thing 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.110
 let's do is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 cut the paper let's cut it we're going 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 to cut strips that are more or less 3 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.110
 times the width that we want 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.290
 so what I'm going to do is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.250
 and then 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.930
 then what we are going to do is to fold 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.930
 this whole paper 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.120
 and it is doubly 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 but I like I want to stay a little 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.100
 narrower do not bend again 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.540
 more or less 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.040
 and the next thing we're going to do is 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.540
 paste our paper that is folded 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.329
 let's paste it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.319
 I mean, I put glue on everything for 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:32.170
 it sticks and I was hard from the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.170
 principle and just like that we will stay 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 yes 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.920
 and now glue on this side too 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.830
 well and now we are going to put glue 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.830
 here 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.390
 but now we are going to spread it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.720
 with the brush 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.940
 so that our whole contour is like this 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.960
 so 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.960
 we double it 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.310
 and we stick it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.700
 then the next step that we're going to 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.540
 do is 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.800
 coast 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.890
 for example I want me 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.760
 that I give them more or less as is 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.390
 half but it was cut 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.540
 more or less like that and what I'm going to do is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.220
 put glue here 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.380
 A) Yes 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.380
 and I so spread it the glue 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.950
 double so 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.390
 that is about half 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.390
 and he doubled here too 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.319
 then so and now what are we going to 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.629
 to do is for this tie 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.900
 make the band that will make the knot 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.450
 but for now I'm going to ask you a little 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 A) Yes 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.500
 to give it the shape so if it dries 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.700
 glue is already going more or less taking the 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700
 shape of our tie 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.020
 then let's do is cut a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.069
 Band-aid that is also 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.380
 three times the thickness you want is 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.600
 much 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.440
 I mean a more finite 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.970
 I have four months that we give many 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.820
 then this band-aid is not necessary 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.740
 put glue the opposites 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.070
 we want it to be a bit flexible for 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.930
 can handle it then now if x and you 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.180
 we put a little bit of glue the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.060
 we doubled in three and now we put a 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.990
 little bit of glue and we return it to 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.820
 fold here like this 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 and it's not going to stay that way 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.569
 and once we 've already doubled it 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.330
 what we have to do is tie 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.200
 so if we want to leave if we want 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.390
 leave 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.730
 a little bit if we are going to leave it like that 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.640
 There is not a little bit ugly all that I 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:38.020
 I do is start from here I put 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.020
 glue on the whole strip 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.650
 I put myself like that 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.540
 and I paste here 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.420
 I have 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.330
 so if I want it with a little bit what 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.550
 What do I do if I do not want it with a tie 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.580
 short here and short here in the part already 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.380
 I can not see it anymore but as if I want it 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.230
 with a bow what I do is paste a little 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.230
 here of glue 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.350
 here glue 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.040
 put some glue and now you 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.040
 I put like this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.480
 and already short 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.850
 and I can give it the shape I want 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.850
 and now we have our appointment 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:36.119
 then we paint to our liking then 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.119
 for example I have is here 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.690
 painted golden 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:47.740
 I have this painted a wood color 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.790
 then with golden eco brushes and also 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.860
 I have this 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:57.560
 I'm going to paint it 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.560
 of this golden congress 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.880
 then with a little paint 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:06.769
 if they want her to put on herself 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:08.479
 there it stays hard but if they want 

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:10.339
 it gets harder you have to wait for it 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.599
 dry before painting because there is no need to 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:15.439
 wait for the glue to dry 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.119
 is inside then if this one is already 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:19.099
 dry then if you want to put a 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:21.439
 bit harder what you have to do is 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:23.729
 give him a layer of glue in all 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:26.069
 are all smoke 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:30.650
 on the whole surface then I'm going to 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.650
 painting is as simple as doing this 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.750
 and so 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.750
 how is it 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.910
 Since he is so tiny, we can not 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:48.470
 stain the hand but good is paint 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.470
 Acrylic is easy to remove 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.250
 and well here they have the variety of the cit 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.710
 you can use it to decorate all 

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.060
 the parties we do and you can 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.080
 use for anything to 

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.060
 make yourself a headband for whatever you want 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:09.009
 well I hope that this tutorial will 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.009
 I liked it and until the next tutorial
