00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.650
 hello to all of you I hope that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 you have the form and welcome to the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.260
 magazine number 49 skyrim fashion on go 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 immediately start this review with 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.570
 a new house rather a new 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.269
 remains the nesque which is called japan 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.359
 the odj a mode that was created by bray 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.820
 tier dated 1 February 2014 is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.200
 really a mode that dates from yesterday so I 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.360
 I'm really happy to have fallen from 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 after you really offer it the most 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 early possible and so you're going to get 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 a Japanese style house in the west 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.460
 white shores exact same 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.230
 location that the house of hobbits 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.879
 that I had previously proposed to you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.739
 except that we will have to walk a whole 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.170
 little bit higher to find the bridge 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 which will offer you direct access to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.449
 this house the interior is really 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 beautiful between the vases the carpets and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 other Japanese decorations 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 even the beds of the paintings that are 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 offered in the rooms game 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 frankly awesome and at the level of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.080
 lighting compared to what comes 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 from the outside because we notice 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.610
 it's really showcases and everything 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.049
 was really top tip 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.119
 after when we come out of the first 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.990
 stay well we'll have access to a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.150
 wrought 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.880
 you'll even have baths next door 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 from another little house that's just 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 next door and note that these baths when 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 you place inside and that you 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.280
 you sit that takes off the clothes 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.689
 directly 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.790
 then if we do not really go down 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.380
 downstairs we will have some kind of table of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.909
 picnic that is really just 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.729
 next to the waterfall and it's really 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.490
 beautiful and in the last house 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 we will have the storage system for 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.549
 the most ingenious armor I have 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.290
 seen so far 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.820
 in any case I think it's one of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.159
 best inventions I've seen you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 click on a button and there a kind 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.479
 avatar of your character appears 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.780
 directly in front of you and I 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.850
 found that really really classy 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.580
 so that's it for this mode japan logic is 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.690
 available on the nexus is also in 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.310
 clickable link in the description in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.250
 second position i will introduce you 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.489
 the armoric black ammunition mode was created 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.150
 by batman a and that dates from January 28 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.940
 2014 last update date of the 1st 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.700
 February 2014 and so this is a mode that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.980
 add different armor and weapons that 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.760
 you will find in forge category 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 dedrick steel leather and miscellaneous category 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.560
 so you'll have for example a holding of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.400
 full rogue with colors 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.959
 different 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.390
 jersey textures at the level of 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.300
 sleeves a steel armor with the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.550
 guild armor shoulder straps 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.910
 thieves just a little 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.800
 texture of a normal rogue outfit 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 it's a small step a mix actually between 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.390
 several textures but in the end it's 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.970
 something that still makes it pretty good 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.950
 and you still have the masks of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.080
 dragon priests who are forget to bhl in 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.420
 dedrick category and you can in 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.850
 also created in the various category 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.709
 of these masks that you can wear to 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.230
 size level to your character 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.730
 so it's more than just making them 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.610
 done in the diverse category and that's 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.160
 good you can wear them on you and 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.480
 at the level of the packs that are available 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.579
 with e.g. strap schools 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.019
 band you have an armor that I do not you 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.370
 have not shown unfortunately because 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.769
 I forgot to do it I think where I 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.320
 did not find but it's an armor 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.329
 with them and well a dragon's head on 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.650
 the side a lot of textures by the way 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.500
 that they get mixed up that are 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 nice enough and also you have 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.769
 hold pictures of what's called 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.079
 of rock corbu 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.299
 if I do not tell you nonsense 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.940
 rock body images that you go 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.359
 can use that have been re texture 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.829
 is a little modified here so I 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.109
 invites you to test for yourself what 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.440
 patchwork wenger the link is available 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.660
 whose description and must be installed 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 after the pack for the dlc first 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.470
 you install the basic mode and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.030
 then you take the special pack 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.800
 for the idea 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.950
 third and last position I you 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.720
 offers the ocean mode looks a mode 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.829
 which is compatible with Corsican and 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.930
 the be ump seven days and the mode is 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.910
 available in five colors so it makes 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.900
 part of the optional files that will be 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.790
 available 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.850
 Also note that you have 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.320
 optional for textures two cases and 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.900
 which are also available on the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.110
 nexus and so this is a mode that has been 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.560
 created by static that dates from the 26th 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.020
 January 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.030
 last update also due date 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.919
 February 1st 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.810
 and so it's a mode that adds and well 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.130
 an outfit so basic she is from a 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.320
 a bluish complexion 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 as you are noticing 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.340
 you will find it in the forge of 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.080
 category leather and after all it is enough 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.660
 simply to replace actually the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.550
 textures by choosing the color that 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.280
 you want in in the files 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.290
 optional so that's the ocean mode 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.750
 pace that is available on the nexus 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.740
 is the link is clickable in the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.590
 description and here's the magazine number 49 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.450
 ends here so I thought about something 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.060
 maybe for future journals like 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.990

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.390

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.720
 I will have to harvest a lot 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.570
