good<00:02:23.440> for<00:02:23.620> me<00:02:23.709> because<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.069> go<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:24.340> Stone

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
good for me because I can go for Stone

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680 
good for me because I can go for Stone
Edge<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.940> then<00:02:25.030> follow<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:25.540> an

now<00:02:28.569> my<00:02:29.110> best<00:02:29.350> play<00:02:29.560> by<00:02:29.739> far<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.610> taunting

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
now my best play by far was taunting

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.330 
now my best play by far was taunting
because<00:02:31.600> mega<00:02:31.810> air<00:02:31.989> dokdo<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.950> actually

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
because mega air dokdo can actually

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.940 
because mega air dokdo can actually
naturally<00:02:33.880> check<00:02:34.480> Salamence<00:02:35.230> due<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.709> its

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
naturally check Salamence due to its

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.430 
naturally check Salamence due to its
bulk<00:02:36.610> as<00:02:36.850> well<00:02:37.030> as<00:02:37.150> its<00:02:37.300> typing<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.959> could<00:02:38.349> go

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
bulk as well as its typing I could go

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.809 
bulk as well as its typing I could go
for<00:02:38.620> top<00:02:38.769> preventing<00:02:39.220> him<00:02:39.310> from<00:02:39.340> setting<00:02:39.730> up

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
for top preventing him from setting up

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.430 
for top preventing him from setting up
and<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> can<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.690> know<00:02:40.780> get<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.290> my

go<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:46.959> stone<00:02:47.260> edge<00:02:47.410> was<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> horrible

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
go for stone edge was a horrible

from<00:03:15.430> Arceus<00:03:16.109> he<00:03:17.109> showed<00:03:17.350> me<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.560> count<00:03:17.769> but<00:03:17.920> I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
from Arceus he showed me the count but I

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
from Arceus he showed me the count but I
counted<00:03:18.370> again<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.760> his<00:03:18.970> conch<00:03:19.209> was<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.450> little

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
counted again and his conch was a little

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.740 
counted again and his conch was a little
bit<00:03:19.900> off<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.590> either<00:03:21.130> case<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.940> get

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
bit off but and either case I get

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.380 
bit off but and either case I get
completely<00:03:23.260> swept<00:03:23.829> by<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.340> salamence<00:03:25.120> so

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
completely swept by this salamence so

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.599 
completely swept by this salamence so
I'm<00:03:25.900> definitely<00:03:26.350> not<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.560> good<00:03:26.920> start<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.340> me
