00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I'm just gonna go for it to protect just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.330 
I'm just gonna go for it to protect just
a<00:01:21.750> scale<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.200> he's<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> should

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
a scale what he's gonna do but I should

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.620 
a scale what he's gonna do but I should
have<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> predicted<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> switch<00:01:24.360> there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
have kind of predicted the switch there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
have kind of predicted the switch there
it<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.080> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.290> bad<00:01:25.500> play<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.920> part<00:01:26.130> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it was kind of bad play on my part so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
it was kind of bad play on my part so
I'm<00:01:26.729> predicting<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> four<00:01:27.420> bus<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.869> onto

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I'm predicting the four bus go onto

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.840 
I'm predicting the four bus go onto
milotic<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.590> easy<00:01:28.829> take<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> bust

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
milotic the easy take this for a bust

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
milotic the easy take this for a bust
and<00:01:30.229> yet<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.979> gonna<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.670> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
do deez numero dos suppose and yeah it's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.420 
do deez numero dos suppose and yeah it's
going<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> go<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.620> drain<00:03:25.830> punch<00:03:26.100> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
going to go for the drain punch and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.949
