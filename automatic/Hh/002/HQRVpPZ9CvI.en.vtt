00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.666
- I thought we should all
play a game together.

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.666
Wouldn't that be fun?

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:06.200
[cheering]

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.766
I'm glad you agree.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.166
So "Know or Go"
only holds three people,

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.366
so instead we're gonna play
my app, "Heads Up".

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.833
And here we go.

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.900
And it's me against
all of you, so...

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.900
[cheers and applause]

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.666
All right.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.633
So you're gonna
give me clues,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.700
and this is something that is
called "The More The Merrier",

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.533
and so it's things you do
as a group.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.033
So you need to kinda
work together to help me guess.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.166
Are you ready, everybody?
All right.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:36.366
[cheers and applause]

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.533
I think you should stand up,
and can they talk,

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.533
or they just have to
act it out, right?

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.533
- Make them talk.
- Okay. All right.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.300
So, ready?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.300
All right, so you're gonna
give me clues.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm gonna look
at all of you, and...

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.066
Oh.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.700
You're a dolphin.
Oh, you're doing a wave.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Yes.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.333
Uh.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.766
Oh. Oh.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.766
Trust f--
trust falls. Yep.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.866
Oh, you're--
you're bashful.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.900
You're so scared
of me.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.266
You're playing
hide and seek.

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.266
Yeah.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.666
You're patty-cake.
You're playing patty-cake.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.666
All right.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.266
A roller coaster.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.133
[audience yodeling]

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.433
You're yodeling?

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.833
You're yodeling?

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.200
That was--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.300
[buzzer sounding]

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.966
I don't know what that is.

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.400
I don't know
what that is.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.800
Oh, the time's up.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.866
What was that?

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.500
(all)
Flash mob.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
Flash mob. Oh, you should have
gotten together earlier

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.666
for that one.
All right.

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.966
One more thing let's all
do together and that's dance.
