00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
fiddly he's not the easiest one to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.940 
fiddly he's not the easiest one to
transform<00:03:39.840> even<00:03:40.140> though<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.260> use<00:03:40.470> one<00:03:40.650> step

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
transform even though I use one step
