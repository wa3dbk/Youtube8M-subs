00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello my sweet today is about one 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 review on the p2 ties sticks the yes 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 from the few months to the new assortment of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 p2 came and that's what I wanted 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 just turn off a review now 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 that is how I find her how much she likes 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 cost and so on and become you 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 I also show all the colors 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.820
 own and you will be on the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.269
 Apply the lips so that we have the one 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 can see a little better and then 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.929
 I'll show you the colors like that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.439
 Overview so I own five pieces 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.630
 from that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.140
 the cost 1 euro 95 just like the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.180
 normal lipsticks from the p2 stands 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 learn as the name implies they are 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.710
 rather schippen founder that does not mean yes 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.390
 so cover 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.059
 the darker the color is I say 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 to cover them there they are like 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 I have five colors I think 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.800
 there are eight or ten colors to son 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 turn and I want you now just 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 demonstrate 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 I start now with the color 0 30 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 Greetings to the way to film 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 called the women so filming and so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 So as I said on so they look like 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.479
 the equally red metallic I find very 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 beautiful I always live the sticker of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 down there, I always stick on top of it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.189
 because I stand with me in the shelf and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 I can recognize 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.270
 yes what's the color now for a color 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.530
 0 3 chris is also my favorite color 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.020
 Manko on the color we already 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 they can really melt 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 There I have to go soon 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.799
 throw away the paint because you can hardly do it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 I can apply more 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.460
 too bad I hope that the next 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.650
 that it might be a monday product 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.329
 or was I perhaps stored too warm 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.100
 I do not know but I will 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.750
 I definitely buy it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 really one of my favorite colors 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.689
 and I wear them now and resist 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.689
 zoom you new items 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.400
 that's what the color looks like in any case 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.170
 very natural pink so no baby 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.759
 pink a dark ping but simply 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.660
 a really nice natural pink 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.760
 then we come to the next one 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 color that is the color 0.60 fame is 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.280
 as a coral pink, I would say 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.780
 You must always remember that is now 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.209
 not great thinking that when I'm choral 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 pink says now is not like this 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.430
 neon pink but rather a sheer 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.130
 Result and how you see the color 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.110
 Definitely a bit stuck there from 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.850
 of course you always have to be consistent 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.610
 go over it a bit and over it 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.140
 go and layer it a bit 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.430
 Feeling also on the lips are the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.319
 really great the greeks even if we 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.750
 ten layers crawl over it 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.040
 the zero in the lips and wrinkles 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.180
 just feel that way 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.350
 lip care so very soft and 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.880
 not difficult at all or so 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.730
 I think they are really great 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.230
 I love you over everything and would love me 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.080
 In any case, p2 will be happy too 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.549
 Some would bring out 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.900
 that's the colors and 60 as I said 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.600
 frames and so she looks at mine 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.180
 So lips out a little differently 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.019
 so maybe the gries color 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.700
 a little bit more all in with it as well 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.920
 really nice as you really see 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.780
 Accordingly, not so but just cover 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.739
 for everyday life or for school 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.269
 I am very beautiful 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.160
 Of course we are not one of them 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.980
 durability so super super long though 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.579
 I think for a euro 95 I think 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.100
 still great and also finds the 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.290
 color only 60 fame very very nice 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.280
 then we come to the next color 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.480
 that's the 0 80 casablanca that's one of those 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.910
 beautiful red as you can see they were real 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.359
 sometimes it is conceivable that now a gaudy 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.519
 red 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.590
 but as I said always are questionable 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.060
 here so i just met him now too 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.859
 again and I think just grad 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.260
 I'm so human, I trust myself 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.630
 not often on really red lipstick 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.459
 turn and there I find such a 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.190
 Alternative it was really nice 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.200
 not so opaque and just not 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 so blatant looks because many red 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.830
 lipstick 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
 really so you just keep on 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.120
 These lips can come because they are so 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.739
 standing out 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.650
 which is more natural 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.230
 Variant I say 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.220
 yes , we did not cover it too 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.150
 can thereby layer more and more 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.410
 apply 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 then, of course , the color always becomes 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.390
 cover there but I find the color 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.400
 Wonderful and so beautiful 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.250
 will shine a bit again 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570
 nice soft on the lips and is 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.370
 a really beautiful natural one 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.550
 red so do not cover up and just 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.400
 Not so I think that this red 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.830
 Color could really stand anyone too 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 People who say red lips are standing by me 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.180
 Not at all that's what I believe in everyone 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.430
 fall as that I find very nice 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.480
 then we come to color 0 40 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.240
 that's the latest color i have now 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.800
 possess he is firmly back because of 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.390
 the consistency and i can change the color 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.150
 not describe at all 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.220
 So I do not know if that's one 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.450
 brownish red or I know really 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.940
 not so i find the color very much 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.680
 unique and beautiful too much for 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:21.700
 suitable for everyday life 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.010
 and that would be on my lips now 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.820
 appearance 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.740
 So I really can not 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.130
 So describe it is not a dream 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.240
 no red that is not any of all 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.210
 but I also like something 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.740
 nice so very very natural 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.790
 you could think is your own 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.790
 I should make lip color 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.849
 I really like it too 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:53.789
 The look today was really good 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.929
 already he should go this courageous direction 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.989
 then we come to the last one 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:06:03.039
 color that's the color 0 90 sex and the 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:06.789
 city and it is such a darker during 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:09.159
 I would describe it yes 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.619
 again rather strong and comes 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.959
 then on the lips very strong 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:15.849
 was a very dark tone but it is not 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.699
 so we think about the normal in the 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:24.129
 Lipstick and the color I found now 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.929
 Also in the fall so please be up 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.699
 In any case, such a reddish atom with 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:29.699
 his bear weft pay possible 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:40.149
 So I really think so too 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:44.439
 beautiful could always have what they wanted 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:46.899
 so I'd say is about the do find 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:50.799
 I was really good at that too 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:52.839
 now my 54 glam lipstick from p2 me 

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:54.429
 Hope the hip swatch is like that 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.459
 further we have brought something 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:59.589
 So as I said all of me are one 

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.419
 bit fixed except the gries 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:05.159
 Makes me melt a bit like that 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:07.619
 eur 95 alone is available at bnp 2 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:10.239
 and i can only do it 

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:12.069
 People really recommend their 

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:15.669
 lipsticks like the natural he 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:17.469
 People like dry lips too 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.999
 so it's got the dry lips 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.149
 really good so are so 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:23.349
 that I really have a nurturing effect 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:25.599
 But they noticed that they dried my lips 

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:28.719
 not at all I can find it 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.159
 In any case very successful and can 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.589
 the only people recommend even so the 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:34.389
 like classic finnish and that was 

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:37.179
 now definitely my review to the 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:39.669
 p2 sticks i hope that through again 

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:40.959
 liked and had brought something and 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.909
 then I would say 

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:44.909
 Let's see next video teams
