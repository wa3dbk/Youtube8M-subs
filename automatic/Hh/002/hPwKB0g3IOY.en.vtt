00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:18.130
 no very inadequate little to do 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.619
 card you can do 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.439
 This is what one of how do 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.410
 picture or bag and want your 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.849
 watercolor effect completely climb through 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.969
 relatively speaking yes then you need 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.290
 called on a lot and the latter 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:43.720
 called to the light and the foundation i am very important 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:49.659
 because if you take a little good 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:59.080
 grab it is desirable that you do not 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:01:01.000
 just because its just a drawing 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.250
 very very long will be difficult 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.860
 grapple 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.979
 if you want a watercolor effect 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.710
 your 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.110
 the bottom was more crawling than that 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.270
 principle can be positioned soak a little 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 feeling heartfelt she didn't bother you and 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.340
 do next 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.920
 the difficulty of working material of the Baltic 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.670
 cardes as you know all the same bright 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 color edge throwing it can spoil 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.940
 you whole picture 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 and how can you emphasize your 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.550
 the picture here is one of the most 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 poisonous sheets except turquoise 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:46.300
 he painted it redeemed q in orange 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 the color on the bright plate icon was before 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.119
 at the expense of the good after all the show itself 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.820
 I do not like the time and the main thing 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.130
 the decoration goes when it dries here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.890
 crowded things seen yellow stains here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.200
 the same happens to us like this 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.660
 bright if you have something on top 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
 white or contrast it in general 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.940
 for carding no matter watercolor or 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.489
 that you have such a thing as there is no long on 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.850
 battery and people preferably but only 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.830
 the fact that there are traces of wrinkles and some 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.380
 other moments may be girls 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.690
 Of course, too, cannons on this other color 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.400
 you have evaporation and dye 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 starts to leave marks 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.170
 here it is here it is yellow it was all 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.980
 white color this yellowness 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.010
 yes it is some hair and carding it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 also painted with carding bottom layer 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.680
 basics if you take
