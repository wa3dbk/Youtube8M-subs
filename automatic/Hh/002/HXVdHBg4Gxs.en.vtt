00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hello everyone welcome to ixtem motorcycle 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.670
 for the video presentation of the new 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 integral of Japanese sho and the nxr then 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.120
 if you know a little bit about the range 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.560
 of toys you surely know the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 hic it feels that was a model 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 flagship in their range had integrated the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.699
 sporty the nxr we suppose for new x r 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.400
 is the substitute of the ixÃ¨ rossant so 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.090
 sporty rather high-end 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 so today I will not do you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 a list of characteristics 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.230
 techniques you can find that on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.850
 our site or even on the site of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 maker 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.340
 I had the chance to ride with any 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.170
 the day yesterday and even this morning 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 again so I'll let you know 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 my impressions with this headset then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 first thing that strikes when we 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.070
 put on this helmet and that will be confirmed 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.870
 after kilometers 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.520
 it is that we have a great freedom 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 of movement one moves the head in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.579
 looking at each other left without any 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.600
 embarrassment it's really also 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.239
 does not impress wearing a helmet 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.859
 done and at the same time we still 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.859
 a great feeling of protection 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.420
 and his feelings in my opinion this is the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.280
 result of the two great strengths of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
 this helmet is on the one hand its very hull 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
 compact this is also to see if 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710
 you compare it with another helmet of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.870
 same size 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 the cap is super well drawn so 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.360
 even at high speed you have no 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.110
 aerodynamic pressure but even when 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 you take a quick look right 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 left at high speed it's not the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 everything from stray vibrations and then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.220
 parallel so there are the foams of 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.710
 cheeks cheeks they are they 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 are really royal they are very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.120
 enveloping very firm without generating 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.500
 no excessive pressure or whatever 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.000
 and that's what makes you go 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.380
 turn your head to the right on the left 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.580
 helmet am to the millimeter you do not have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.080
 not that feeling of people trying 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.090
 to bring the helmet and he does not want to come 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.590
 so that's for me the two big ones 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.210
 strong points the hull very compact and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650
 the mousses of really very very good 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.930
 quality 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.580
 second thing on this headset which is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.650
 very nice is the breakdowns on 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.030
 is on an integral typed sport so 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.070
 that's normal the breakdowns are 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 generous very generous even so you 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.390
 go find four on the front 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.540
 one at the classic chin level a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.360
 on the front and two on the top of the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.860
 skull and for good outdoors moisture 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.870
 the heat all that you have in addition 6 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.550
 extractor in the back so that's 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.489
 generous you have cold limit when 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.960
 you open all in winter what third 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.470
 thing 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.290
 the screen the screen is new on this nxr 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.000
 so it's a bit confusing at first 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.650
 is hard enough to handle in fact a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.030
 will at shaw and they did a 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530
 much more firm system which 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.080
 allows when the site when the screen is 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.240
 Closed locked it is strongly plated 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.250
 on jeans waterproofing it's a big 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.540
 advantage is that the seal is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.860
 really very good is not a net 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.210
 of air passing and you win a small 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.830
 little soundproofing so for a 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.920
 sports helmet it is relatively 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.470
 silent next to that good we're on 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.330
 a sports helmet a so dual screen 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 solar must forget and then at the level 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.520
 of the closure we are on a loop 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.650
 double d so the classic tested a 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.270
 integral sports so that's what I 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.250
 could you tell about this integral 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.080
 hot and the nxr after riding a 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.560
 little bit with so a really a 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.170
 high-end sports integral product 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.160
 it is available so in finish 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.860
 unique as you see here too 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.209
 full of deco very successful coup the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.860
 prices will range from a little less 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.320
 430 euros for the versions united to 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.300
 501 that less than 530 euros for 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.070
 decorations stuff available in the spring 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.970
 2014
