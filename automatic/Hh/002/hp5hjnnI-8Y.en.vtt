00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
pushing it back together and pushing

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.010 
pushing it back together and pushing
both<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.600> our<00:01:58.720> pins<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.880> style<00:02:01.659> of

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
both of our pins in this style of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.580 
both of our pins in this style of
disassembly<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.330> one<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:04.990> available<00:02:05.200> on

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
disassembly is one that is available on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.350 
disassembly is one that is available on
all<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.250> rear<00:02:06.399> charging<00:02:06.820> systems<00:02:07.210> they

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
all of the rear charging systems they

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.969 
all of the rear charging systems they
all<00:02:07.479> take<00:02:07.689> apart<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:08.140> way<00:02:08.349> they<00:02:08.590> all<00:02:08.709> clean

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
all take apart this way they all clean

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.949 
all take apart this way they all clean
this<00:02:09.160> length<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.509> we're<00:02:10.660> going<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.840> go

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
this length and so now we're going to go

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.130 
this length and so now we're going to go
over<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.230> version<00:02:11.440> two<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.850> arms<00:02:13.270> 53

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
over to version two which is the arms 53

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.030 
over to version two which is the arms 53
AR<00:02:14.950> which<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:15.970> firearm<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.380> we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
AR which is this firearm right here we

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
AR which is this firearm right here we
call<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.520> AR<00:02:18.819> because<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> does<00:02:19.420> accept

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
call it the AR because it does accept
