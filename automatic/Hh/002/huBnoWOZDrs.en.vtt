my hotel which I just showed you at the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.530 
my hotel which I just showed you at the
beginning<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:04.449> near<00:01:04.689> wano<00:01:05.199> ecchi<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.160 

right<00:01:09.990> along<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> street<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> guess<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:13.020> all

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
right along a street that I guess is all

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
right along a street that I guess is all
about<00:01:13.410> motorcycles<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> figured<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
about motorcycles so I figured I just
