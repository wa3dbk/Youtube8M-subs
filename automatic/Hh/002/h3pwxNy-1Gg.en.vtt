is<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:26.640> designed<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.180> lights<00:00:27.870> based<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
is we designed our lights based on the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.330 
is we designed our lights based on the
consumers<00:00:29.550> activities<00:00:30.270> so<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:31.650> look<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.920> lumen

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
