00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hey people get to another one 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.100
 episode of the trainers career namely 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.899
 episode number 25 today is a bit shorter than 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.429
 but otherwise I think you can 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.809
 endure the first game of today 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.820
 Anyway, the game went in the same time 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.530
 bundesliga against hertha bsc berlin like 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 even in the next life last 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 Unfortunately, weekend as evb lost and that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.500
 yes not necessarily deserves them 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.970
 Keep losing so it is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 at some point no wonder more 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.310
 anyway the first chance in this 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 play after just six minutes 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 by ditib with this beautiful shot 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 but no problem for power the corner 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 However, like the carballo 10 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 played just six minutes and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.809
 cavallo is already rising in the highest 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 heads the thing in and there you see 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.380
 again how enormously important this man is for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
 Our team is not just defensive 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.110
 but also offensively he plays around 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000
 really good 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 continue to be on the left 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.050
 The site had too much space 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 flank and there are those with 20 10 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.379
 minutes played without a chance 20 and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960
 already we had a relative 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 comfortable initial situation worried in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 this game by the beautiful flank of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 Rush the good header from ibisevic 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.050
 in the power has no chance but it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 was not over yet 14 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 minute djuric again nice ball too 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 it has too much space again 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.589
 try with the shot but then im 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.210
 no problem for the end 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.590
 ball over the gate can steer him over 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 nevertheless, we dominated this first 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 half so far very clear 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.869
 serious error then, however 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.250
 ok, but the big one for lustenberger 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.420
 There was also another turn we see 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.920
 same time again it was his turn 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.780
 that was really strong but 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.009
 the ball would probably be over anyway 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 he left him again 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.220
 a little bit more towards the gate though 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 Nevertheless , you have to keep it well 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 sometimes also say the corner here 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 dangerous 19 minutes played now the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 chance this construction we have the corner in 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.460
 to bring the middle something starts 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.369
 lets take some time to the balcony 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 middle and there is baroque ios good ball 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.150
 and then again ben hatira but good 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 clarified by my defense and the chance 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.450
 never again before bastians though 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.710
 its flank can be blocked to happiness 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.390
 and the chance will be there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 slowly the hardness came but it was better 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 audi on the next big chance but again 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 as a concern there can very well parry and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.540
 but still not over 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 baumjohann again with the fernschuss 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.659
 but over the gate over 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.280
 Slowly , the hertha came too 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.259
 opportunities and has one after another 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.880
 a good chance but then this 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.329
 hewitt has a serious ball loss 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.899
 the ball 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.070
 do you speak wb700 quite silly soon 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.270
 full of the rear crew of hertha 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.590
 Here you really had the chance 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 to come back because they were good at 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.039
 play in it and then such a stupid 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.840
 error and already stehts 30 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.130
 next chance for me nasty joke and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.930
 as 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.340
 over the must actually be in it 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.080
 beautiful ball of maxxim on the meadow 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.240
 Wich of the ball then on the relative 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 abandoned goal passes by 13 0 so 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.290
 at half past half then the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.640
 has a better chance at the first chance 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.050
 directly for baroque 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.700
 or the other player but 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 then in the end no problem 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 In return I love her with is through 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.650
 this will have the big chance but power 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.050
 keeps great and then in the end 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.790
 peer clever just before the line clear 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.100
 and even after that nothing is created 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.660
 unfortunately, shortly after this, these 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.130
 chance this stock was hurt 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.930
 had to come out for him balfour diehl 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.910
 and in return the herthaner with the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.320
 good chance but again they switch 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.300
 a responsibility that has held everything here so far 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.290
 and a super great game but made 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.600
 still not over here 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.550
 Ronny once again a chance on me before 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.230
 all rolli and the shot then in the 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 finally blocked but always again 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.950
 the chance buckley out but responce fits 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.810
 great and can be good here too 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.910
 intervene and the chance or 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.830
 to prevent the enemy as I said before 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.990
 lay with an outstanding game 75 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.630
 sarah who changed to hertha for us 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.220
 Well kept and again was inconceivable 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.270
 What we held here next two 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.650
 great cards from him 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.390
 if we win this then 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.620
 we definitely owe it to him though 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.520
 hertha did not want that so easily 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.800
 to be with you 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.980
 next chance by the striker here 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.180
 barrios but fortunately at the gate over 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.470
 that 's it in the end that too 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.700
 game actually goes from zero to zero 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.320
 in the end, the hertha really was 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.140
 not bad was about the same 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.670
 as we had many opportunities etc but 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.080
 Oblig was in the way and left no gates 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.110
 to and therefore the game goes 3 to 0 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 for us a little too high but I want 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.840
 do not complain 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.790
 this will be very nice with one next 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.440
 bad diagnosis because he would be three 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.430
 months are missing a very long time for 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.410
 such an important player 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.490
 now he had to be replaced by 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.280
 balfour deal also in the game against 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.870
 freiburg in the cup a not as 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.940
 simple game takes effect as early as 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.890
 But what was it all for? 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.180
 freiburg the first chance roadmaps but 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.610
 his shot is much too targeted and targeted 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860
 so clear about how beautiful the hertha 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.270
 in the last game there was freiburg 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.209
 strangely, too big a mistake with 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.560
 get carried away and use maxim 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.030
 then the ball is in defense 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.190
 Bringing the job skin through shows the thing 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.380
 nothing to hold 10 after nine minutes 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.850
 here, too, the very early leadership 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.500
 just played a few minutes 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.540
 by this serious defensive error of 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.640
 freiburg the thirtieth already good that 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.229
 are mothers there is mac media and the 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.610
 choice is also in balance 30 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.349
 admir no 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.580
 the admira is called no he is not on 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.159
 I have no idea what's called mehmedi 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.060
 in any case, he has with the suitcase gate 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.199
 a little luck that the ball from 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.879
 inside post goes in but of course 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.310
 also a good header and thus have 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.300
 but then again the momentous 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.550
 Ball loss but fortunately Baumann can 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.319
 settle the mistake of his frontman 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.419
 and the shot of dell for him 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.569
 the second half is already very well 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.259
 alexandrow maxime on belval gate 2 2 1 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.300
 in the 51st 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.169
 crossed for the nice pass from 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.969
 maxim and then with his weak 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.449
 left skin the thing of the beginnings ins 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.400
 left corner 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.259
 nothing to hold for baumann again 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.330
 the same combination maximov for the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.430
 next chance the ball before the three to 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.319
 one the team of the freiburg 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.569
 already relatively wide open nice ball 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.560
 here of course from maxxim but it 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.240
 was not so hard 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.669
 Nevertheless, the freiburger also with 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.080
 chances will be me or something anyway 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.090
 but header over the goal 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.889
 but then there were some changes in the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.909
 january and calm came for google 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.590
 sad and again a player after 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.750
 These then change directly from damp 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.389
 his first action with the goal 472 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.770
 about ranking made then when 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.120
 His strength is not necessarily the 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.560
 quickness or anything at 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.599
 but if he can what then shots are 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.159
 that showed impressively gets the ball 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.169
 skin directly into it from a good eck 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.610
 distance and the ball is in there thus so 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.960
 almost the preliminary decision but the 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.039
 freiburg wanted to bring something else 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.110
 because the game was far from it 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.120
 over claus again on the outer track 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.409
 there is terrazzino and meets weak 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.779
 made of the subject in the game against 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.610
 hertha was so strong here with relative 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:51.110
 bad timing and thus the 4 2 for 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.580
 freiburg and now another ten minutes 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.479
 about for freiburg and me actually 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.879
 to achieve even more 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.550
 they wanted 88 jonathan has schmid 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.659
 too much space and there is the can 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.580
 luckily, do not process ball and ball 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.110
 Thus, the task of catching the ball can be luck 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.370
 had the game for us, however 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.050
 still not over 90 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.719
 terrazzino again the scorer 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.919
 terrazzino pakistan later on again 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.599
 the outer track in the middle and there is 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.699
 again terrazzino but rüdiger can 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.139
 luckily block the ball from him 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.400
 that 's it in the end two 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.870
 too much is at stake for us 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.310
 get a round in the cup what 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.509
 very good is also when it is in 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.800
 final effect again relatively difficult 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.050
 was because freiburg towards the end again 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.159

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.659

 episode as I said a little shorter than 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.330
 otherwise look again next time 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.129
