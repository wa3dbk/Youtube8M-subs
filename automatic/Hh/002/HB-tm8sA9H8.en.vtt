00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.829
 let's remove the other spark plug 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.039
 They are a bit dry because they have time 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.660
 spark plugs are bankrupt if not 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.660
 come out let's use 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.750
 our ratchet to make it spin a 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.150
 little more we already have our screwdriver 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:36.390
 and we are going to remove the music 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.880
 let's see the platinum is its use 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 normal but look I want you to see here at 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.810
 side of the rope of an approach 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.710
 to the point of 4 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.840
 see how it brings a bit of body 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.410
 why because this woman when squeezing 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.950
 where are you going 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.820
 and pressed others or being a little 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.350
 hot the car went from squeezing 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.170
 let's see if it looks to see how 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.870
 brought me a piece of agreement is there 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.530
 that notify saves the client because 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.610
 because the mechanic never took precaution 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.940
 if they can see how the rope is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.120
 if you already fell down see here I have the piece 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.920
 of rope if they reach it to see how 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.040
 he fell 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.619
 there is the case of the body if I go 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.470
 to pull because this enters the motor can 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.320
 harm there are children but see we take the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.840
 spark plug and that was the mechanic's fault 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.090
 previous that squeezed too much 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 women are spark plugs as we are going to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.580
 press the squeeze and then a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.860
 16 returned to the middle of a quarter of 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.800
 return 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.130
 forgiveness is a quarter turn no more 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.240
 let's see this spark plug just as platinum 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.480
 to the burner well let's check how 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.010
 is the best action has had bounces 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:07.310
 the power of masters is not well 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.940
 this music we are going to remove the piston 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.940
 number 1 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.440
 let's see how it is 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.000
 do not want to loosen let's increase 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.000
 our rattle 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 to loosen up a little bit more and that's it 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.930
