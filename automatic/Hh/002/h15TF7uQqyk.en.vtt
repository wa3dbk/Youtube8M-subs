00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
as first flight around our solar system

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.180 
as first flight around our solar system
here's<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.879> picture<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.240> Mars<00:00:03.710> by<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.740> way<00:00:04.950> this

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
back in the 70s talking about that there

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.399 
back in the 70s talking about that there
was<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> race<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.450> people<00:01:20.750> lived<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.050> Mars

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
was a race that people lived on Mars

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.859 
was a race that people lived on Mars
they<00:01:22.340> had<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> terrible<00:01:22.940> catastrophe<00:01:23.090> about

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
they had a terrible catastrophe about

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.499 
they had a terrible catastrophe about
186<00:01:24.710> thousand<00:01:25.159> years<00:01:25.310> back<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.299> time

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.240 
186 thousand years back at the time
there<00:01:26.750> was<00:01:26.840> about<00:01:27.049> 40<00:01:27.380> million<00:01:27.619> people<00:01:27.890> killed

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
there was about 40 million people killed

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.940 
there was about 40 million people killed
on<00:01:28.430> Mars<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.170> they're<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.290> gone<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:30.560> of

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
on Mars and they're all gone now of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.749 
on Mars and they're all gone now of
course<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:33.080> they're<00:01:33.289> worse<00:01:33.440> societies<00:01:34.429> there

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.700 
course so they're worse societies there
and<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.210> will<00:01:35.390> find<00:01:35.630> quite<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.929> few<00:01:36.020> remains<00:01:36.560> of

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
it they went to different places in our

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.180 
it they went to different places in our
galaxy<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.289> show<00:02:00.560> him<00:02:00.710> around

galaxy to show him around

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.649 
galaxy to show him around
this<00:02:01.610> was<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.909> craft<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.330> was<00:02:02.450> right<00:02:02.630> in

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
this was the craft that was right in

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.180 
this was the craft that was right in
front<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.140> them<00:02:03.229> as<00:02:03.319> they<00:02:03.440> were<00:02:03.500> flying<00:02:03.830> into

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280 
front of them as they were flying into
it<00:02:04.280> he<00:02:04.340> took<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.550> picture<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.149> one<00:02:05.290> here

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
it he took a picture of that one here

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.710 
it he took a picture of that one here
again<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.189> back<00:02:07.640> at<00:02:07.880> Mars<00:02:08.119> these<00:02:08.479> aren't<00:02:08.660> in

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
again is back at Mars these aren't in

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.639 
again is back at Mars these aren't in
any<00:02:08.810> particular<00:02:09.019> order

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649

any particular order
here's<00:02:10.070> another<00:02:10.250> object<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:11.299> orbit<00:02:11.630> around

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
here's another object in orbit around

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.350 
here's another object in orbit around
Mars<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.860> look<00:02:13.040> here's<00:02:13.310> an<00:02:13.400> American<00:02:13.850> flag<00:02:13.970> on

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
Mars and look here's an American flag on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.520 
Mars and look here's an American flag on
it<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.600> there's<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.840> couple<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.200> things<00:02:18.410> that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it so there's a couple of things that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.020 
it so there's a couple of things that
they<00:02:18.709> put<00:02:18.950> up<00:02:19.070> there<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.519> military's

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
they put up there that the military's

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.120 
they put up there that the military's
put<00:02:20.239> up<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.570> don't<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:20.870> about<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.950> is

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
put up that we don't know about this is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.150

you know there you can imagine the
people<00:03:13.410> at<00:03:13.470> NASA<00:03:13.650> would<00:03:13.980> crack<00:03:14.280> up<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.819> idea

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.319 
people at NASA would crack up the idea
they'd<00:03:17.190> probably<00:03:17.370> find<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.819> little<00:03:18.030> hard<00:03:18.209> to

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
they'd probably find a little hard to

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.699 
they'd probably find a little hard to
believe<00:03:18.569> at<00:03:18.720> first<00:03:18.750> but<00:03:19.290> they<00:03:19.410> don't<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
believe at first but they don't have

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.650 
believe at first but they don't have
