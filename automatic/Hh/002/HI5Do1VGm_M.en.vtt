00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
big bottom level spreader here on the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
big bottom level spreader here on the
bottom<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.110> I've<00:01:28.979> already<00:01:29.189> unhooked<00:01:29.700> then

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bottom which I've already unhooked then

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
bottom which I've already unhooked then
hooked<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> feet<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> pull

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
hooked on the feet here and we can pull

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.420 
hooked on the feet here and we can pull
that<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:35.009> once<00:01:35.250> you've

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that out of the way then once you've

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.420 
that out of the way then once you've
done<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.470> we<00:01:37.470> now<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.950> remove<00:01:38.130> these

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
done that we now have to remove these

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
done that we now have to remove these
feet<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.479> these<00:01:39.630> feet<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
feet because these feet are not going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.740 
feet because these feet are not going to
allow<00:01:40.650> us<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.000> holes<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.570> which

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
allow us to use the holes here which

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.249 
allow us to use the holes here which
you're<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.430> give<00:01:44.430> us<00:01:44.549> access<00:01:45.259> pass

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you're going to give us access pass

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.920 
you're going to give us access pass
through<00:01:46.880> into<00:01:47.880> our<00:01:47.970> sockets<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.530> once<00:01:49.740> we

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
through into our sockets and once we

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.420 
through into our sockets and once we
now<00:01:51.410> we<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.740> do<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.860> that's<00:01:52.220> our<00:01:52.340> next

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
now we have to do that that's our next

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.540 
now we have to do that that's our next
step

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.090 

so<00:01:58.550> those<00:01:58.700> are<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.910> feet<00:01:59.150> from<00:01:59.830> off<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
so those are the feet from off the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.890 
so those are the feet from off the
bottom<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:02.000> don't<00:02:02.090> really<00:02:02.210> need<00:02:02.420> those<00:02:02.660> so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
bottom and we don't really need those so

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.720 
bottom and we don't really need those so
those<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.100> go<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.030> bag<00:02:05.240> for<00:02:05.540> safekeeping

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
those can go in the bag for safekeeping

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.300 
those can go in the bag for safekeeping
move<00:02:07.730> on<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.090> next<00:02:08.119> step<00:02:09.040> okay<00:02:10.040> for<00:02:10.280> our

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
move on to the next step okay for our

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.440 
move on to the next step okay for our
next<00:02:10.399> segment<00:02:11.560> put<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> head<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:14.270> right

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
next segment put the head just right

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.530 
next segment put the head just right
there<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.750> bag<00:02:15.050> we're<00:02:15.500> going<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.680> put<00:02:15.830> it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
there in that bag we're going to put it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.160 
there in that bag we're going to put it
here<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.460> crane<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.940> already<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.140> our

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
here on the crane I already have our

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.010 
here on the crane I already have our
block<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.340> big<00:02:22.640> screw<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.570> go<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.840> there

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
block a big screw there to go in there

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.080 
block a big screw there to go in there
so<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.950> got<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.310> pretty<00:02:25.520> much<00:02:25.610> put<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.970> on

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
so I got it is pretty much put that on

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.930 
so I got it is pretty much put that on
there<00:02:26.270> screw<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.900> right<00:02:27.020> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.660 

and<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:37.070> couple<00:02:38.070> minutes<00:02:38.520> is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and as you can see a couple minutes is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.280 
and as you can see a couple minutes is
struggling<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.360> knobs<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.810> try<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.110> get

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
struggling with the knobs to try to get

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.190 
struggling with the knobs to try to get
it<00:02:40.410> all<00:02:41.120> screwed<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.270> there<00:02:42.480> tightly<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:43.050> now

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it all screwed on there tightly we now

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.320 
it all screwed on there tightly we now
have<00:02:43.410> our<00:02:43.560> head<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:44.040> attached<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.180> can

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
have our head that's attached so we can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.740 
have our head that's attached so we can
move<00:02:45.480> our<00:02:45.600> camera<00:02:46.170> independently<00:02:47.750> doing

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
move our camera independently doing

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.170 
move our camera independently doing
smooth<00:02:49.050> pants<00:02:49.620> why<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.250> lift<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.700> down<00:02:50.880> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
smooth pants why we lift up and down and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.910 
smooth pants why we lift up and down and
so<00:02:51.330> forth<00:02:51.600> gives<00:02:52.470> us<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.680> little<00:02:52.770> more

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
so forth gives us a little more

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.440 
so forth gives us a little more
flexibility<00:02:54.200> I'm<00:02:55.200> shooting<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> get

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
flexibility I'm shooting this is a get

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.730 
flexibility I'm shooting this is a get
so<00:02:57.660> ahead<00:02:57.810> by<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.170> way<00:02:59.000> very<00:03:00.000> nice<00:03:00.180> okay<00:03:00.840> next

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
so ahead by the way very nice okay next

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.810 
so ahead by the way very nice okay next
step<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> put<00:03:03.210> these<00:03:03.450> pieces<00:03:03.690> together<00:03:04.820> and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
step is to put these pieces together and

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.810 
step is to put these pieces together and
by<00:03:06.510> simply<00:03:06.960> taking<00:03:07.800> these<00:03:08.070> little<00:03:08.340> knobs<00:03:08.520> off

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
by simply taking these little knobs off

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.070 
by simply taking these little knobs off
here<00:03:09.590> slide<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.800> other<00:03:10.950> end<00:03:11.220> onto<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:12.480> put

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
here slide the other end onto this put

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.430 
here slide the other end onto this put
the<00:03:13.230> screws<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.890> wella<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:16.230> course

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the screws back in wella and of course

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.310 
the screws back in wella and of course
you<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> connect<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.630> aren't<00:03:18.630> as<00:03:19.140> well

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
you have to connect the aren't as well

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.340 
you have to connect the aren't as well
that<00:03:20.130> controls<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:21.450> pivot<00:03:21.780> point<00:03:22.020> here<00:03:22.200> up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
that controls the pivot point here up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.580 
that controls the pivot point here up
and<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.330> base<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.960> for<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
and down for the base for the for the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.660 
and down for the base for the for the
head<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:26.750> put<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> together<00:03:27.990> next<00:03:28.530> step<00:03:28.770> here

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
head so put it together next step here

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.070 
head so put it together next step here
we<00:03:29.820> go<00:03:29.960> so<00:03:30.960> now<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.350> crane<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.650> assembled

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
we go so now that the crane is assembled

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080 
we go so now that the crane is assembled
we're<00:03:34.080> going<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.290> need<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.670> when<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:35.790> put<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
we're going to need to when we put the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.540 
we're going to need to when we put the
head<00:03:36.270> on<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.480> front<00:03:37.070> going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.370> take

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
head on the front going to have to take

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.670 
head on the front going to have to take
the<00:03:38.820> plate<00:03:39.480> goes<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.350> tripod<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.270> move<00:03:42.270> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
the plate goes on the tripod and move it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.950 
the plate goes on the tripod and move it
and<00:03:43.680> clamp<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.370> crane<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.630> so

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
and clamp it to the crane here like so

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.910 
and clamp it to the crane here like so
to<00:03:46.950> give<00:03:47.130> us<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.460> mounting<00:03:47.970> point<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:49.320> we're

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
to give us a mounting point and we're

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520 
to give us a mounting point and we're
going<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.100> threw<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.550> in<00:03:50.670> with<00:03:51.200> these<00:03:52.200> right

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
going to threw it in with these right

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.590 
going to threw it in with these right
here<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:54.150> that's<00:03:54.630> our<00:03:54.870> next<00:03:55.080> step

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.690 

you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.369 

heads<00:04:02.510> installed<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.709> head<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:04.430> installed<00:04:05.379> is

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
heads installed the head is installed is

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.740 
heads installed the head is installed is
so<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:06.950> sits<00:04:07.190> underneath<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:08.000> we<00:04:08.150> just<00:04:08.360> pop<00:04:08.599> it

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
so it sits underneath so we just pop it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.250 
so it sits underneath so we just pop it
right<00:04:09.530> on<00:04:09.680> top<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.780> tripod<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.959> slide<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
right on top of the tripod and slide it

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.720 
right on top of the tripod and slide it
on<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:13.550> it's<00:04:14.209> all<00:04:14.330> good<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.629> go<00:04:15.280> with<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.459> head

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
on and it's all good to go with the head

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.199 
on and it's all good to go with the head
on<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.419> side<00:04:17.959> with<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> camera<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.340> then

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
on that side with the camera and then

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.120 
on that side with the camera and then
the<00:04:20.600> control<00:04:21.109> line<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.650> runs<00:04:21.739> along<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
the control line that runs along the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.190 
the control line that runs along the
bottom<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.910> handle<00:04:23.450> at<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.600> back<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
bottom to the handle at the back and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.530 
bottom to the handle at the back and
then<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.220> course<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.580> counterweight<00:04:26.060> section

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
then of course the counterweight section

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.060 
then of course the counterweight section
which<00:04:26.690> we<00:04:27.080> haven't<00:04:27.200> got<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.590> point<00:04:27.889> yet

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
which we haven't got to that point yet

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.070 
which we haven't got to that point yet
but<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.000> next<00:04:29.240> step<00:04:29.419> since<00:04:29.660> I'm<00:04:29.780> doing<00:04:30.020> this

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
but the next step since I'm doing this

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.010 
but the next step since I'm doing this
by<00:04:30.260> myself<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:31.300> pick<00:04:32.300> up<00:04:32.389> that<00:04:32.419> whole<00:04:32.750> rig

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
by myself is to pick up that whole rig

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.730 
by myself is to pick up that whole rig
and<00:04:33.620> put<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:33.950> onto<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.220> tripod<00:04:34.460> and

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
and put it onto the tripod and

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.310 
and put it onto the tripod and
unfortunately<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:36.800> can't<00:04:37.010> film<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.960> at<00:04:38.960> least

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
together I noticed that when I put the
right<00:06:09.470> amount<00:06:09.500> of<00:06:09.800> weight<00:06:09.980> on<00:06:10.160> it<00:06:11.150> was<00:06:11.300> still

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
right amount of weight on it was still

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.270 
right amount of weight on it was still
the<00:06:13.340> weights<00:06:13.550> were<00:06:13.730> a<00:06:13.760> little<00:06:13.910> too<00:06:14.150> heavy

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
the weights were a little too heavy

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.030

until<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.310> put<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.640> tape<00:06:16.910> in<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.240> camera<00:06:18.040> and

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
until I put the tape in the camera and

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.130

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
then all of a sudden the weight was fine

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.650 
then all of a sudden the weight was fine
so<00:06:21.590> you<00:06:21.650> always<00:06:21.920> have<00:06:22.040> to<00:06:22.340> make<00:06:22.490> sure<00:06:22.550> that<00:06:23.540> the
