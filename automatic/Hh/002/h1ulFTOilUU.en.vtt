can see our boosters already running to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.640 
can see our boosters already running to
the<00:00:23.100> spot<00:00:23.340> he<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.820> climbs<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.480> dust<00:00:25.470> bin

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the spot he just climbs up that dust bin

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
the spot he just climbs up that dust bin
or<00:00:25.980> whatever<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.090> climbs<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.449> onto<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
crazy it's checking his corners and then

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
crazy it's checking his corners and then
booster<00:00:30.000> number<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.390> will<00:00:30.810> put<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.170> his<00:00:31.289> tag

booster number one will put down his tag

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.799 
booster number one will put down his tag
insert<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.630> it's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
insert probably over there because it's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600

sight but mostly out of sight boosters
number<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.040> may<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.430> lay<00:00:38.550> down<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
number two may just lay down there and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
number two may just lay down there and
start<00:00:39.390> shooting<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.800> an

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
start shooting you know it's not an

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
start shooting you know it's not an
obvious<00:00:41.070> spot<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.320> like

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
obvious spot because you know it's like

obvious spot because you know it's like
the<00:00:43.620> corner<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> map<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the corner of the map and it's kind of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.729 
the corner of the map and it's kind of
at<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.239> elevated<00:00:45.539> position<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
at an elevated position it's just a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
at an elevated position it's just a
little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.070> harder<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.899> know<00:00:49.020> notice

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
little bit harder to you know notice

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229 
little bit harder to you know notice
that<00:00:49.649> there's<00:00:49.800> somebody<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.280> however<00:00:50.760> this

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that there's somebody there however this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.389 
that there's somebody there however this
is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> sort<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> common<00:00:52.379> spot<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> mean<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
is a sort of a common spot so I mean I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
is a sort of a common spot so I mean I
wouldn't<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> surprised<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.829> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
wouldn't be surprised if this would be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
wouldn't be surprised if this would be
one<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:56.460> spots<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> would

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
one of the first spots that you would

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060 
one of the first spots that you would
find<00:00:57.809> boosters<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.739> were<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

find boosters in if you were in the
lobby<00:01:04.159> alright<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.369> spot<00:01:05.790> number<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.119> will

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
lobby alright so spot number two will

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
take us to the bottom left corner of the
map<00:01:08.040> well<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.610> corner<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
as you can see our boosters really

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.969 
as you can see our boosters really
excited<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.290> he's<00:01:13.470> already<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
excited because he's already put down a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
excited because he's already put down a
stack<00:01:14.250> insert<00:01:14.580> he's<00:01:14.790> already<00:01:14.909> run<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.540> put

down his claim or just in case somebody
comes<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> corner<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> possibly

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
comes around the corner and possibly

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.649 
comes around the corner and possibly
notices<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.830> boosting<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.790> I'm<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> booster

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
notices them boosting so I'm the booster

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.539 
notices them boosting so I'm the booster
one<00:01:22.170> loser<00:01:22.470> might<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:22.830> his<00:01:22.920> tack<00:01:23.070> insert<00:01:23.430> on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
one loser might put his tack insert on

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
one loser might put his tack insert on
that<00:01:23.700> side<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.420> hidden<00:01:24.659> some<00:01:25.560> went<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:25.920> by

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that side it's hidden some went well by

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.429 
that side it's hidden some went well by
that<00:01:26.130> loot<00:01:26.759> crate<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that loot crate as you can see and the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
that loot crate as you can see and the
other<00:01:28.560> booster<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.310> most<00:01:29.549> likely<00:01:29.729> want<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
other booster would most likely want to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
other booster would most likely want to
stay<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> sight<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.930> he<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.229> probably

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
stay out of sight so he would probably

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.850 
stay out of sight so he would probably
stay<00:01:31.710> behind<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.100> cover<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.030> truck

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
stay behind the cover of the truck

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
stay behind the cover of the truck
that's<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> second<00:01:35.790> spot<00:01:39.229> for<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that's it for the second spot for the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
that's it for the second spot for the
third<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> final<00:01:41.159> spot<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
third and final spot we will be going to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.530 
third and final spot we will be going to
the<00:01:42.570> bottom<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.079> hand<00:01:43.110> corner<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.130> mat

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the bottom right hand corner of the mat

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.789 
the bottom right hand corner of the mat
cargo<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
cargo as you can see here with the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
cargo as you can see here with the
booster<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.610> his<00:01:47.820> tack<00:01:48.329> insert<00:01:48.750> right

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
booster has put his tack insert right

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.429 
booster has put his tack insert right
behind<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.380> red<00:01:49.649> crepe<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.110> then<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.409> other

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
behind this red crepe and then the other

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
behind this red crepe and then the other
boost<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:52.950> most<00:01:53.159> likely<00:01:53.340> sit<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.759> behind

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
boost would most likely sit right behind

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
boost would most likely sit right behind
it<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.420> he<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.259> covered<00:01:55.649> from

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it as he is really well covered from

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940 
it as he is really well covered from
most<00:01:56.640> angles<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.659> only<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:57.990> ways<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.259> get

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
most angles there's only two ways to get

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.740 
most angles there's only two ways to get
into<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.340> place<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> both<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.570> able<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
into this place and both will be able to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
into this place and both will be able to
look<00:02:00.899> both<00:02:01.380> ways<00:02:01.439> behind<00:02:02.369> each<00:02:02.490> other<00:02:02.640> so

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
look both ways behind each other so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
look both ways behind each other so
that's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.210> pretty<00:02:03.390> good<00:02:03.570> place<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.590> you
