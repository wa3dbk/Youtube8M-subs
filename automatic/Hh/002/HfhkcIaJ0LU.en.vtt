00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
little bit faster well you can for just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.160 
little bit faster well you can for just
about<00:00:14.490> every<00:00:14.969> gun<00:00:15.150> except<00:00:15.809> maybe<00:00:15.960> the

Icebreaker gained popularity with the
knoll<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.710> beyond<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.730> so

apparent how long that reload animation

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.759 
apparent how long that reload animation
is<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:24.029> people<00:00:24.480> were<00:00:24.630> desperate<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.470> make<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
is that people were desperate to make it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.589 
is that people were desperate to make it
a<00:00:25.830> little<00:00:25.949> bit<00:00:26.130> shorter<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.449> just

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
a little bit shorter you can do for just

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
a little bit shorter you can do for just
about<00:00:27.689> every<00:00:28.080> gun<00:00:28.230> reload<00:00:28.859> animation

to reload and then sprinting away as

the<00:00:37.500> animation<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> wait

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the animation so you don't have to wait

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.270 
the animation so you don't have to wait
until<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> gun<00:00:39.510> drops<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.230> place<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:41.010> he

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280

until the gun drops into place before he
can<00:00:41.430> fire<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.270> makes<00:00:42.480> things<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.140> little

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
can fire it makes things just a little

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.069 
can fire it makes things just a little
bit<00:00:43.500> faster<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.460> also<00:00:44.640> switch<00:00:45.180> guns<00:00:45.660> as

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
bit faster you can also switch guns as

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
bit faster you can also switch guns as
soon<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:47.070> gun<00:00:47.460> reloads<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.539> cancel<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
soon as your gun reloads to cancel the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
soon as your gun reloads to cancel the
animation<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.250> ways<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.700> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
animation there are two ways to really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
animation there are two ways to really
know<00:00:51.149> when<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.260> start<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.800> reload

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
know when you can start the reload

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.580 
know when you can start the reload
animation<00:00:53.730> cancelling<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.390> noticeable<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
animation cancelling a noticeable way is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
animation cancelling a noticeable way is
you'll<00:00:55.920> notice<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.670> ammunition<00:00:57.360> count

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you'll notice your ammunition count

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740 
you'll notice your ammunition count
going<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.530> after<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.309> reload<00:00:59.640> finishes<00:01:00.300> but

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
going up after the reload finishes but

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.209 
going up after the reload finishes but
when<00:01:00.899> there's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.530> things<00:01:01.739> happening

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
when there's a lot of things happening

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
when there's a lot of things happening
in<00:01:02.370> destiny<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.149> difficult<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in destiny it's difficult to look in the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
in destiny it's difficult to look in the
lower<00:01:04.350> left<00:01:04.589> corner<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.700> I've<00:01:05.850> been

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
lower left corner so how I've been

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390 
lower left corner so how I've been
keeping<00:01:06.390> track<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> making<00:01:07.470> sure<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
keeping track of it is making sure that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
keeping track of it is making sure that
I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.580> sprint<00:01:09.240> forward<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.780> switch<00:01:09.990> guns

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I don't sprint forward or switch guns

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
I don't sprint forward or switch guns
until<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> bullets<00:01:11.640> enter<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> gun

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
until I see the bullets enter the gun

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140 
until I see the bullets enter the gun
this<00:01:13.049> usually<00:01:13.320> notifies<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.909> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
this usually notifies that you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
this usually notifies that you can
perform<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> reload<00:01:16.320> animation<00:01:16.350> cancel<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
perform the reload animation cancel and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
perform the reload animation cancel and
you'll<00:01:17.580> still<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:18.030> bullets<00:01:18.330> ready<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you'll still have your bullets ready to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
you'll still have your bullets ready to
go<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> point<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
go I'm gonna go over when that point is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
go I'm gonna go over when that point is
so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> start<00:01:22.020> getting<00:01:22.140> used<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so you can start getting used to it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
so you can start getting used to it
right<00:01:22.830> away<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.369> gonna<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.060> every<00:01:24.420> gun

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
right away I'm gonna do it for every gun

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.870 
right away I'm gonna do it for every gun
time<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> start<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.439> hand<00:01:25.710> cannons<00:01:26.130> incan

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
time you start with hand cannons incan

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
time you start with hand cannons incan
and<00:01:27.030> reload<00:01:27.360> starts<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and reload starts right when your

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
and reload starts right when your
Guardians<00:01:29.100> thumb<00:01:29.520> pushes<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.479> bullets<00:01:31.049> into

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Guardians thumb pushes the bullets into

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
Guardians thumb pushes the bullets into
the<00:01:31.470> chamber<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> freeze-frame<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.030> can

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the chamber and a freeze-frame you can

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.469 
the chamber and a freeze-frame you can
see<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.049> clearly<00:01:34.759> for<00:01:35.759> auto<00:01:35.939> rifles

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
see this pretty clearly for auto rifles

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200 
see this pretty clearly for auto rifles
it's<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:37.350> guardian<00:01:37.890> snaps<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's right when your guardian snaps that

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.320 
it's right when your guardian snaps that
cartridge<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
cartridge and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.030 
cartridge and
for<00:01:42.330> scout<00:01:42.660> rifles<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.650> similar<00:01:44.010> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
for scout rifles it's pretty similar to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.460 
for scout rifles it's pretty similar to
auto<00:01:44.310> rifles<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.510> soon<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> clicks<00:01:46.260> you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
auto rifles as soon as it clicks you're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
auto rifles as soon as it clicks you're
ready<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.800> go<00:01:52.250> pulse<00:01:53.250> rifles<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.910> again

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
ready to go pulse rifles it's again

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
ready to go pulse rifles it's again
pretty<00:01:54.479> similar<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.440> have<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> wait

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pretty similar you just have to wait

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
pretty similar you just have to wait
