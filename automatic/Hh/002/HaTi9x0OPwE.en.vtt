00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
video really quickly I just kind of want

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.319 
video really quickly I just kind of want
to<00:00:30.900> talk<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.140> planets<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.250> space<00:00:32.329> engineers

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
to talk about planets in space engineers

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
to talk about planets in space engineers
as<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.809> recently<00:00:34.290> announced<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> keen

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
as it was recently announced by a keen

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.299 
as it was recently announced by a keen
software<00:00:35.760> house<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> engineers

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
software house so a lot of you engineers

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.090 
software house so a lot of you engineers
out<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:39.230> expecting<00:00:40.230> every<00:00:40.500> update<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
out there are expecting every update to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
out there are expecting every update to
see<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.579> planet<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
see that planet but that's going to be a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.190 
see that planet but that's going to be a
big<00:00:43.950> big<00:00:44.460> update<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> don't<00:00:45.570> expect<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.020> see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
big big update so I don't expect to see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
big big update so I don't expect to see
that<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.399> near<00:00:47.640> future<00:00:47.879> hopefully

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that in the really near future hopefully

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
that in the really near future hopefully
there's<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.440> bug<00:00:49.710> fixing<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's gonna be a lot of bug fixing and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
there's gonna be a lot of bug fixing and
that<00:00:50.430> sort<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:52.020> planets<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that sort of thing but with planets it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.729 
that sort of thing but with planets it
opens<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> whole<00:00:53.670> new<00:00:54.170> prospect<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.379> things

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
opens up a whole new prospect of things

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.209 
opens up a whole new prospect of things
that<00:00:55.949> could<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.370> added<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> game<00:00:58.219> anyway

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that could be added to the game anyway

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910 
that could be added to the game anyway
if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> relatively<00:01:00.780> active<00:01:01.170> space

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
if you are a relatively active space

if you are a relatively active space
engineer<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> Steam<00:01:03.329> Workshop<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.229> are

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
engineer on the Steam Workshop you are

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.380 
engineer on the Steam Workshop you are
probably<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:04.769> familiar<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> am

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
probably very familiar with what I am

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
probably very familiar with what I am
driving<00:01:07.170> around<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.000> has

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
driving around on right now as this has

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
driving around on right now as this has
been<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.170> top<00:01:10.409> spot<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> Steam

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
been in the top spot on the Steam

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
been in the top spot on the Steam
Workshop<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:12.390> several<00:01:13.020> days<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
Workshop for several days now and it is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660 
Workshop for several days now and it is
a<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:15.360> very<00:01:15.689> cool<00:01:16.049> world<00:01:16.409> no<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a very very cool world no it is not a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
a very very cool world no it is not a
full<00:01:18.030> circular<00:01:18.600> planet<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> flat<00:01:19.979> 1000<00:01:20.970> x

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
full circular planet it is a flat 1000 x

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.710 
full circular planet it is a flat 1000 x
1000<00:01:22.049> space<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.040> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.700> idea<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.450> what

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
1000 space to kind of get a idea of what

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
1000 space to kind of get a idea of what
planets<00:01:25.170> could<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.070> space

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
planets could look like in space

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
planets could look like in space
engineers<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> once<00:01:28.229> i<00:01:28.409> saw<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.890> i'm<00:01:29.100> like

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
engineers and once i saw this i'm like

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
engineers and once i saw this i'm like
oh<00:01:29.490> yeah<00:01:29.909> yeah<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.229> cool<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.100> big

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
oh yeah yeah that could be cool the big

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
oh yeah yeah that could be cool the big
question<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.240> exactly<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> going

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
question is what exactly is this going

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
question is what exactly is this going
to<00:01:34.680> bring<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> table<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:36.060> space

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to bring to the table for space

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.039 
to bring to the table for space
engineers<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.720> could

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
engineers now I can see where they could

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
engineers now I can see where they could
add<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> whole<00:01:40.740> bunch<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.220> extra<00:01:41.549> content<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
add a whole bunch of extra content to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.920 
add a whole bunch of extra content to
the<00:01:42.270> game<00:01:42.509> where<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.210> maybe<00:01:45.210> grow<00:01:45.570> food

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the game where you can maybe grow food

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.319 
the game where you can maybe grow food
and<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.220> could<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.549> another<00:01:47.700> place<00:01:48.119> where

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and this could be another place where

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
and this could be another place where
you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.750> oxygen<00:01:49.439> perhaps<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.610> add

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you can get oxygen perhaps they can add

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can get oxygen perhaps they can add
some<00:01:51.329> enemy<00:01:52.049> AI<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.500> threaten<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
some enemy AI to threaten you here you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
some enemy AI to threaten you here you
can<00:01:54.479> build<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:55.110> buildings<00:01:55.560> maybe<00:01:55.860> they'll

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
can build some buildings maybe they'll

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
can build some buildings maybe they'll
add<00:01:56.219> some<00:01:56.670> additional<00:01:56.790> blocks<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> stuff

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
add some additional blocks and stuff

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.249 
add some additional blocks and stuff
that<00:01:58.469> will<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.700> curtailed<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.719> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that will be more curtailed for this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
that will be more curtailed for this
specific<00:02:01.469> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.119> similar

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
specific kind of thing but it's similar

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.370 
specific kind of thing but it's similar
to<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.500> question<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.280> asking<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.540> 7<00:02:07.200> days

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to my question I was asking in my 7 days

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.960 
to my question I was asking in my 7 days
to<00:02:07.590> die<00:02:07.729> video<00:02:09.110> where<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:11.160> point<00:02:11.489> 0<00:02:11.670> going

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to die video where is one point 0 going

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
to die video where is one point 0 going
to<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.420> space<00:02:12.720> engineers

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to be in space engineers

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
to be in space engineers
so<00:02:13.680> like<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.550> where<00:02:14.819> they<00:02:14.970> are<00:02:15.000> as

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so like I don't know where they are as
