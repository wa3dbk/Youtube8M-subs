00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.100 
and just play stronger and i thought as
a<00:01:44.880> team<00:01:45.270> were<00:01:45.390> able<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> thought<00:01:46.049> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
a team were able to do that I thought we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
a team were able to do that I thought we
played<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.320> great<00:01:46.439> game<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.180> good

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
played a great game you know good

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.530 
played a great game you know good
two-way<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.280> that's<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> pretty

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
two-way game and that's that's a pretty

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.700 
two-way game and that's that's a pretty
good<00:01:51.689> team<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.049> beat<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> think<00:01:52.500> we're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
good team that we beat so I think we're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
good team that we beat so I think we're
very<00:01:52.740> happy<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.250> where<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
very happy with it where do you see the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.350 
very happy with it where do you see the
most<00:01:54.479> improvement

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
most improvement

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
most improvement
neutral<00:01:57.360> zone<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.230> I<00:01:58.290> think<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.620> when

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
neutral zone I think I think that when

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.780 
neutral zone I think I think that when
you<00:01:58.770> played<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> road<00:01:59.280> against<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.670> they

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you played on the road against them they

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.960 
you played on the road against them they
were<00:01:59.910> coming<00:02:00.150> with<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.330> lot<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.480> speed<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.970> you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
were coming with a lot of speed and you

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.700 
were coming with a lot of speed and you
know<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.180> spent<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.480> lot<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:03.720> trying<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
know he spent a lot of time trying to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.500 
know he spent a lot of time trying to
work<00:02:04.830> on<00:02:05.010> that<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.370> in<00:02:05.790> practice<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.450> in

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
work on that and in practice and in

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.820 
work on that and in practice and in
meetings<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:06.960> stuff<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.320> thought<00:02:07.500> that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
meetings and stuff and I thought that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.919 
meetings and stuff and I thought that
you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> went<00:02:08.490> well<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.840> we

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
you know that went well and you know we

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.999 
you know that went well and you know we

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
just played to the game plan and I

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.520 
just played to the game plan and I
thought<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> was<00:02:11.340> good<00:02:11.959> that's<00:02:12.959> career-high

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
thought it was good that's career-high

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.949 
thought it was good that's career-high
six<00:02:13.890> goals<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.490> now<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.780> just

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
six goals for you now and is it just

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.390 
six goals for you now and is it just
about<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.320> opportunity<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> getting<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
about the opportunity of getting a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.190 
about the opportunity of getting a
chance<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.060> maybe<00:02:18.240> they<00:02:18.780> didn't<00:02:19.080> get

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
chance here that maybe they didn't get

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.490 
chance here that maybe they didn't get
