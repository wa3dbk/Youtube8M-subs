00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.162
 Welcome to Space Lab! I'm Lucian and Kaufich. 

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:06.258
 I am an astrophysicist from Princeton University, where I study stars 

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:10.588
 And the planets with the mission of Kepler of NASA and I am here today to answer your questions. 

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:16.060
 The first question: if we add more mass to the moon and therefore make us stronger gravity forces 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.253
 Does it affect Earth's rotation? 

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:24.592
 It is a good question, in order to understand how the rotation of the Earth can change 

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:30.759
 If the mass of the Moon is greater, we must know how its current mass affects Earth's current rotation. 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.693
 The moon and Earth interact through gravity, and the moon affects the rotation of our planet through 

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:41.106
 Its shape is slightly oval 

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:46.448
 Because it pulls the forces of attraction on the ground from one side to another or what we call the forces of tide and islands. 

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:50.999
 This actually affects the surface slightly 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.504
 But more so on the seas and oceans. 

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:59.217
 It also causes ocean accumulation on one side of the planet 

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:02.388
 So . We get the so-called swell tide 

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:06.846
 So with respect to this swell of the tide, in the course of the Earth's rotation, it drifts slightly forward to place 

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:12.596
 The moon is in the sky, but the moon keeps attracting the earth and pulling it, so in fact through gravity 

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.811
 The moon creates a force that makes the earth slow in its rotation over time. 

00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:17.818
 This slowdown is very, very few 

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:23.835
 Its amount is actually about 1,500 parts per second per century, but it increases over time 

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:28.084
 If we had waited for enough time, it would have been, in the end, the moon and the earth 

00:01:28.084 --> 00:01:34.137
 They will become fully trapped, so that only one hand of the earth will face the same face of the moon forever 

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:37.838
 So only one hand of the earth will be able to see the moon 

00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:41.335
 So, if the Moon's mass could have been much greater than it is now 

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:46.337
 Will make and build a larger force on the ground and thus cause it to slow down 

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:49.692
 In the rotation of the earth to get faster and faster 

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:54.108
 The second question is, "Small things are attracted by big things 

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:58.181
 So, why is the moon moving away from Earth? 

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.198
 In fact, the answer to this question is related to answering the first question. 

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:06.275
 Since the moon and the earth influence one another and interact by gravity, the moon slows down 

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:11.093
 Rotation of the Earth Over time, this means that the Earth is losing energy 

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:14.041
 While the moon gains that energy. 

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:18.957
 The moon's acquisition of that energy means that it will rotate farther and farther from Earth. 

00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:23.261
 So, in fact, the moon moves away from Earth, even through the influence of gravity. 

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:26.837
 Over time, this means that the moon is winding outward. 

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:31.145
 We can measure it, because we do experiments where we make laser beams bounce off 

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:36.510
 Reflective mirrors left by Apollo astronauts. (Apollo is a US space program for the landing of astronauts on the moon) 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.747
 So it is possible to determine and measure that the moon moves away, and that also means 

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:45.172
 We live somewhat in an exceptional time, where the Moon is in the best command, the same virtual size 

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:51.244
 Of the sun in the sky, and that means that we live in a time when it is possible to obtain solar exegetes. 

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:56.097
 So, years and years now, the virtual size of the moon will be 

00:02:56.097 --> 00:03:00.722
 Smaller than that of the sun, so the solar eclipse will cease to occur. 

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:08.465
 The third question is: "Why do celestial bodies such as stars, planets, and moons, always be spherical in their form?" 

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:12.051
 Well, the answer is that they are really not all spherical. 

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:16.305
 Even if you're probably used to some of the biggest objects in our solar system, 

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:20.821
 Such as the sun, earth or even other planets such as Jupiter, it's spherical 

00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.604
 However, most of the objects in the solar system are in fact somewhat spherical, rectangular or rectangular in shape 

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:27.787
 It looks a bit like a potato bean 

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:29.773
 A good example is asteroids 

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:33.791
 Asteroids are objects small enough that most of them did not have enough mass 

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.429
 To make gravity form them spherically at the time of composition. 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:42.504
 So even if gravity is from the material that formed these asteroids and made them hold together to this day, 

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:48.548
 It is really impossible for very small objects to be spherical. 

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.894
 Thank you for these wonderful questions. 

00:03:46.957 --> 00:04:18.000
