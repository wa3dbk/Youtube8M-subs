let's<00:00:07.109> fold<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.529> steamer<00:00:08.000> we'll<00:00:09.000> begin<00:00:09.240> by

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
let's fold a steamer we'll begin by

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.129 
let's fold a steamer we'll begin by
simply<00:00:10.799> folding<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> paper<00:00:11.670> diagonally<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
simply folding the paper diagonally and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.410 
simply folding the paper diagonally and
then<00:00:13.530> unfold<00:00:14.039> again

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.310 

well<00:00:21.420> then<00:00:23.240> unfold<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.810> repeat<00:00:27.140> take<00:00:28.140> your

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
well then unfold and repeat take your

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
well then unfold and repeat take your
time<00:00:28.530> for<00:00:28.800> those<00:00:29.039> steps<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:30.360> that<00:00:30.539> matter

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
time for those steps and for that matter

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.510 
time for those steps and for that matter
with<00:00:31.170> every<00:00:31.590> step<00:00:32.899> because<00:00:33.899> no<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.070> chases

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
with every step because no one chases

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.410 
with every step because no one chases
you<00:00:36.380> for<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> nice<00:00:37.680> result

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
you for a nice result

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.889 
you for a nice result
make<00:00:39.420> nice<00:00:39.600> creases<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.760> another<00:00:41.760> tip<00:00:42.030> again

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
make nice creases and another tip again

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.970 
make nice creases and another tip again
fold<00:00:43.680> away<00:00:43.950> from<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:45.060> towards<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.980> it's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
fold away from you not towards you it's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
fold away from you not towards you it's
much<00:00:47.220> easier<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.810> we<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.260> fold

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
much easier that way now we will fold

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.690 
much easier that way now we will fold
every<00:00:50.160> corner<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> center<00:00:52.190> in<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.370> model

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
every corner to the center in this model

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700 
every corner to the center in this model
we'll<00:00:53.970> need<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.450> do<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> three<00:00:55.200> times

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we'll need to do that three times

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
we'll need to do that three times
so<00:01:00.350> crease<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.620> center<00:01:06.079> and<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.450> go

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so crease to the center and there we go

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.270 
so crease to the center and there we go
now<00:01:10.590> turn<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.459> sheet<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.569> those

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
now turn your sheet that's what those

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.279 
now turn your sheet that's what those
nice<00:01:14.280> circles<00:01:14.939> mean<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.780> symbol<00:01:16.170> you're

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
nice circles mean that symbol you're

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.230 
nice circles mean that symbol you're
seeing<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:16.829> and<00:01:18.289> repeat<00:01:19.289> it<00:01:19.409> again

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
seeing right now and repeat it again

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
seeing right now and repeat it again
fold<00:01:21.240> both<00:01:21.420> corners<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:22.319> the<00:01:22.350> center<00:01:24.920> those

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
fold both corners to the center those

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.019 
fold both corners to the center those
creases<00:01:26.249> come<00:01:26.789> in<00:01:27.149> really<00:01:27.659> handy<00:01:27.899> now<00:01:28.259> because

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:29.029 
creases come in really handy now because

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:31.219 
creases come in really handy now because
just<00:01:30.029> where<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> intersection<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
just where the intersection of the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.919 
just where the intersection of the
creases<00:01:31.499> this<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.039> your<00:01:32.459> center<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.299> much

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
creases this is your center so it's much

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:44.120 
creases this is your center so it's much
easier<00:01:40.340> okay<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> turn<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> again<00:01:42.749> and<00:01:43.130> one

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
easier okay and turn it again and one

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.550 
easier okay and turn it again and one
last<00:01:44.399> time<00:01:44.729> fold<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:45.509> corners<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> center

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.230 

by<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> paper<00:01:53.219> is<00:01:53.459> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.819> thick<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
by now the paper is a little thick so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.489 
by now the paper is a little thick so
take<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.389> time<00:01:57.919> and<00:02:00.200> because<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.469> are

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
take your time and because we are

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.370 
take your time and because we are
folding<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> often<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.989> center<00:02:04.349> I

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
folding so often to the center I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.219 
folding so often to the center I
recommend<00:02:04.979> using<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.549> paper<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> beginner

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
recommend using a paper for a beginner

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.600 
recommend using a paper for a beginner
that's<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:08.660> bigger<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.400> we

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that's a little bigger now you see we

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's a little bigger now you see we
have<00:02:11.760> those<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.270> pockets<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.050> we'll<00:02:13.740> open

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
have those two pockets and we'll open

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.500 
have those two pockets and we'll open
them<00:02:15.440> pull<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> now<00:02:17.610> flatten<00:02:18.210> them

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
them pull them out and now flatten them

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
them pull them out and now flatten them
so<00:02:19.760> here<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> here<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.870> new<00:02:22.350> creases<00:02:23.090> just

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so here it and here are new creases just

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.080 
so here it and here are new creases just
like<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.160> that's<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> two

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
like that and that's one of the two

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.080 
like that and that's one of the two
pipes<00:02:27.680> from<00:02:28.680> our<00:02:28.830> steamer<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> we'll<00:02:29.640> repeat

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
pipes from our steamer and we'll repeat

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.530 
pipes from our steamer and we'll repeat
that<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> other<00:02:31.110> side<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.540> that's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that with on the other side and that's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.530 
that with on the other side and that's
now<00:02:33.840> our<00:02:34.080> second<00:02:34.680> pipe<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.460> as<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> last<00:02:36.240> step

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
now our second pipe and as the last step

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.540 
now our second pipe and as the last step
we'll<00:02:37.080> pull<00:02:37.440> those<00:02:37.770> two<00:02:38.040> corners<00:02:38.720> outside<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
we'll pull those two corners outside and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.220 
we'll pull those two corners outside and
collapse<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> whole<00:02:41.850> model<00:02:42.300> fold<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.110> little

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
collapse the whole model fold a little

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.350 
collapse the whole model fold a little
on<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> edges<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.130> that's<00:02:44.820> already<00:02:45.120> our

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
on the edges and that's already our

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.860 
on the edges and that's already our
steamer

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
steamer

00:02:45.870 --> 00:03:04.130 
steamer
have<00:02:46.020> fun<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.410> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.200
