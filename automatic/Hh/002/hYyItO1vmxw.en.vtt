00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
which was a figure to be all figures so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.570 
which was a figure to be all figures so
we<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.449> gorillas<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.470> trolls<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.220> males

and females on everything all on that
one<00:00:23.039> figure<00:00:23.869> now<00:00:24.869> through<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.769> process<00:00:26.010> we

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
one figure now through this process we

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.380 
one figure now through this process we
realized<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.439> creating<00:00:28.439> clothing<00:00:29.390> for

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
realized that creating clothing for

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.920 
realized that creating clothing for
female<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.590> figure<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.120> quite

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
female on that figure just was not quite

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
female on that figure just was not quite
as<00:00:34.230> simple<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
as simple to do as we would like and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.799 
as simple to do as we would like and
also<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.290> were<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:38.510> usability<00:00:39.510> issues

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
also there were just usability issues

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
also there were just usability issues
that<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.050> felt<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> address<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that we felt we need to address and so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.069 
that we felt we need to address and so
we<00:00:41.520> split<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.090> basis<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> male<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> female

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
we split out the basis to male a female

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
we split out the basis to male a female
so<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.789> those<00:00:45.270> two<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.719> will

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
so the first of those two that we will

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.740 
so the first of those two that we will
release<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> Genesis<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.100> female<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
release is the Genesis to female and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.260 
release is the Genesis to female and
we'll<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> releasing<00:00:49.140> Victoria<00:00:49.680> six<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
we'll be releasing Victoria six on that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.869 
we'll be releasing Victoria six on that
now<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> reason<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.670> Genesis<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
now the reason that we have a Genesis to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.150 
now the reason that we have a Genesis to
base<00:00:54.329> female<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> Victoria<00:00:55.829> six

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
base female and then a Victoria six

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
base female and then a Victoria six
character<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.059> top<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:59.030> we

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
character on top of that is because we

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
character on top of that is because we
like<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:00.989> from<00:01:01.140> Genesis<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:01.890> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like what we got from Genesis where we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
like what we got from Genesis where we
had<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:03.500> base<00:01:04.500> model<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.090> fairly

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
had a a base model that was fairly

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
had a a base model that was fairly
natural<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> details<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
natural and the details and that kind of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
natural and the details and that kind of
thing<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.369> by<00:01:12.180> building<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.840> generic

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
thing and so by building a generic

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.760 
thing and so by building a generic
female<00:01:14.040> base<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.080> still

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
female base that is you know still

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.520 
female base that is you know still
pleasing<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.380> then

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
pleasing and good to use but then

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
pleasing and good to use but then
building<00:01:19.920> Victoria<00:01:20.369> six<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.700> top<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
building Victoria six on top of that it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
building Victoria six on top of that it
means<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> Victoria<00:01:21.990> six<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.650> more

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
means that Victoria six we can go more

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.210 
means that Victoria six we can go more
detailed<00:01:23.909> than<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.180> did<00:01:24.299> before<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.930> can

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
detailed than we did before we can

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.100 
detailed than we did before we can
squeeze<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> pinch<00:01:26.640> things<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.330> ways<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
squeeze and pinch things in ways that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.340 
squeeze and pinch things in ways that
make<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> model<00:01:29.520> work<00:01:29.810> without<00:01:30.810> having<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
make the model work without having a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
make the model work without having a
concern<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> being<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.400> base<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.180> other

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
concern about it being a base for other

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
concern about it being a base for other
shapes<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> ahead<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> load<00:01:36.420> our

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
shapes so I'll go ahead and load our

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.999 
shapes so I'll go ahead and load our
Genesis<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.439> base<00:01:37.680> female

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.480

character<00:04:16.900> presets<00:04:17.320> would<00:04:17.560> make<00:04:17.739> her

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
character presets would make her

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.560 
character presets would make her
character<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.120> build<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.360> character

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
character so if you build a character

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.040 
character so if you build a character
for<00:04:20.049> justice<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> female<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.450> recommend<00:04:22.450> making

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
for justice to female I recommend making

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.900 
for justice to female I recommend making
a<00:04:23.200> character<00:04:23.500> preset<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.430> will<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:24.730> make

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
a character preset that will then make

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.650 
a character preset that will then make
it<00:04:25.120> so<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.460> apply<00:04:27.460> your<00:04:27.970> figure<00:04:28.420> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
it so that you can apply your figure and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.920 
it so that you can apply your figure and
have<00:04:29.290> her<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.590> their<00:04:29.770> defaults<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.750> make

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
have her be their defaults just to make

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.870 
have her be their defaults just to make
a<00:04:31.960> little<00:04:32.440> better<00:04:32.620> user<00:04:33.040> experience<00:04:33.130> for

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
a little better user experience for

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.300 
a little better user experience for
people<00:04:33.970> while<00:04:34.240> they're<00:04:34.330> posing<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:35.230> that's<00:04:36.040> I

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
people while they're posing and that's I

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.710 
people while they're posing and that's I
think<00:04:36.340> that's<00:04:36.700> enough<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:37.090> wrap<00:04:37.270> up<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
think that's enough to wrap up the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.110 
think that's enough to wrap up the
introduction<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.590> using<00:04:38.800> Genesis<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.700> female

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
introduction to using Genesis to female

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.630 
introduction to using Genesis to female
