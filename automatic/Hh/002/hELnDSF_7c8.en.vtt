00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.179
 a beautiful good evening 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.239
 through a few faces I know yes I thought in Lichtenstein if not 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.980
 completely foreign 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.990
 I'm glad that so many new faces can get to know each other 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.819
 and thank you 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:30.859
 4 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.230
 all people who made this evening possible 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.750
 Now I've realized that it is completely 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.300
 whole handful of people were the one tonight so worked 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.400
 to have 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.899
 I am very pleased 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.950
 the same stop 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 my great and heartfelt concern to speak about man 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.810
 and his relationship with the not prevent it lie worlds 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.140
 today is soon the healing with the power of the angels 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.879
 This is 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.879
 tt-line is my books 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.350
 and always if not 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.000
 go in such a way and see many people of me 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.350
 That's been around for 8 years 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.220
 the speaker for work I wonder what should I tell the people 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.440
 and then I look at the guardian angels of the people 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.330
 who came here and then I calmed Conze 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 then I feel people and not just think which one is one of them 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 and then I think about content 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.159
 and do not ask Haller Engel who will continue now 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.780
 for this topic 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.510
 to stand by me 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.620
 and since today the topic of HIV is dark I see myself in the middle of us 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.250
 Veins clearly fast 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 It's never going to end in the green and purple light 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.470
 introduce all 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.290
 all of us 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.689
 and by that I know 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.340
 if he is there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.999
 it's all about us being 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.999
 understand the healing formula 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.639
 Healing means 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.170
 to have inner experiences 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 the last euro to open 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.059
 one also realizes attained the life of the attacks 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.699
 recognize yourself 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.489
 and then 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 lived real peace 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.799
 as interesting and far-reaching as it sounds 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.019
 that's the way it is and I will be better in this hour 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.739
 First of all, the emphases of our lives are speaking 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.719
 and then over 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.679
 the marriage is not full effect of the spiritual worlds 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.049
 in our life 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.479
 and then finally come to our human possibilities 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:10.789
 and on our singing would be possible would be successful 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.789
 and loving way to be 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.019
 sometimes «that one targets me over the 5 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.599
 around 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.620
 advantageous and cheesy idea of ​​the people 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.299
 because people often believe through materials 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.589
 you have to meet a man who meets Jesus 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.589
 in touch and then it has resolved 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.159
 but also in the Bible 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.159
 your faith likes itself 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.789
 helps the faith in everyday life 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.729
 not always as you imagine what is going on there wrong 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.789
 Often people imagine themselves now finally has to be an angel 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.789
 come down and then everything is paletti 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.499
 and that is also a material idea 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.519
 When people forget about burying there is also a free will in there 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.459
 which the loving does not because the spiritual world never intervenes 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.239
 Accidents or later 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.229
 humans allow themselves humans 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.259
 to focus on 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.740
 and they ensure freedom and also their power 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.889
 to remember his duties 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.539
 and to ask this cu-loving special question 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 what is the see 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.960
 that they are in sickness this evening 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.979
 until 10 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.720
 of a state 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 finally, the meaning of life 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.559
 Believe me and my abilities were first in childhood 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.659
 so that deceased have seen 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.789
 In the course of the therapeutic work, the protégés of the people came to it 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.240
 and more angels 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.569
 and I was amazed when I realized 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.069
 the mental development of man here
