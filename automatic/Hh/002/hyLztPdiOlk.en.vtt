here at the Miami International Boat
Show<00:00:08.730> 2010<00:00:09.730> you<00:00:10.450> may<00:00:10.599> have<00:00:10.750> heard<00:00:11.020> about

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
Show 2010 you may have heard about

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.440 
Show 2010 you may have heard about
braking<00:00:11.800> system<00:00:12.250> on<00:00:12.340> a<00:00:12.400> personal<00:00:12.880> watercraft

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
braking system on a personal watercraft

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.810 
braking system on a personal watercraft
and<00:00:13.750> we're<00:00:13.990> gonna<00:00:14.080> explain<00:00:14.470> how<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.800> CDI<00:00:15.280> BR

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
and we're gonna explain how the CDI BR

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820 
and we're gonna explain how the CDI BR
or<00:00:16.090> intelligent<00:00:16.689> brake<00:00:16.869> and<00:00:17.050> reverse<00:00:17.380> system

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
or intelligent brake and reverse system

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.279 
or intelligent brake and reverse system
actually<00:00:18.099> works<00:00:18.519> so<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:20.020> with<00:00:20.230> the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
actually works so now with the

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.200 
actually works so now with the
fly-by-wire<00:00:20.680> system<00:00:21.400> we<00:00:21.550> are<00:00:21.580> able<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:22.000> get

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
fly-by-wire system we are able to get

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.240 
fly-by-wire system we are able to get
rid<00:00:22.449> of<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.750> large<00:00:23.050> reverse<00:00:23.590> handle<00:00:24.100> and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
rid of the large reverse handle and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.210 
rid of the large reverse handle and
actually<00:00:25.020> integrate<00:00:26.020> it<00:00:26.199> into<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:26.740> handlebar

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
actually integrate it into the handlebar

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.340 
actually integrate it into the handlebar
so<00:00:27.460> it's<00:00:27.610> very<00:00:27.760> similar<00:00:28.119> to<00:00:28.270> a<00:00:28.449> snowmobile<00:00:29.140> or

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
so it's very similar to a snowmobile or

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.159 
so it's very similar to a snowmobile or
a<00:00:29.440> bicycle<00:00:30.130> or<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.670> lot<00:00:31.300> of<00:00:31.330> different<00:00:31.630> vehicles

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
a bicycle or a lot of different vehicles

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.110 
a bicycle or a lot of different vehicles
have<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.770> brake<00:00:32.980> lever<00:00:33.280> on<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.520> handlebars

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
have the brake lever on the handlebars

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.149 
have the brake lever on the handlebars
just<00:00:34.719> simply<00:00:35.260> pulling<00:00:35.559> in<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:35.949> lever

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.159 
just simply pulling in the lever

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.149 
just simply pulling in the lever
overrides<00:00:36.999> any<00:00:37.300> throttle<00:00:38.050> input<00:00:38.469> so<00:00:39.069> it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
overrides any throttle input so it

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.799 
overrides any throttle input so it
overrides<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.699> throttle<00:00:39.999> input<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.510> then<00:00:40.690> it

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
overrides a throttle input and then it

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.770 
overrides a throttle input and then it
drops<00:00:41.079> down<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:42.370> essentially<00:00:43.149> is<00:00:43.479> the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
drops down what essentially is the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.529 
drops down what essentially is the
reverse<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:44.350> brake<00:00:45.129> bucket<00:00:45.609> you<00:00:46.030> can<00:00:46.059> see<00:00:46.420> the

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
reverse and brake bucket you can see the

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.419 
reverse and brake bucket you can see the
reverse<00:00:46.719> bucket<00:00:47.379> underneath<00:00:47.649> that's<00:00:48.039> nothing

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
reverse bucket underneath that's nothing

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.180 
reverse bucket underneath that's nothing
new<00:00:48.460> sea-doo<00:00:48.879> invented<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.569> in<00:00:49.809> 1990<00:00:50.649> what

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
new sea-doo invented that in 1990 what

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.259 
new sea-doo invented that in 1990 what
is<00:00:51.399> new<00:00:51.729> is<00:00:52.389> this<00:00:52.749> large<00:00:53.170> aluminum<00:00:53.620> gate

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
is new is this large aluminum gate

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.699 
is new is this large aluminum gate
behind<00:00:55.269> that<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.719> when<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.350> fully

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:56.709 
behind that and when it's fully

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:59.459 
behind that and when it's fully
depressed<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:58.209> drops<00:00:58.539> down<00:00:58.659> below<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.289> hall

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
depressed it drops down below the hall

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.160 
depressed it drops down below the hall
about<00:00:59.769> two<00:01:00.069> inches<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.789> kind<00:01:01.479> of<00:01:01.569> acts<00:01:01.780> as<00:01:02.019> a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
about two inches and kind of acts as a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.170 
about two inches and kind of acts as a
reverse<00:01:02.499> spoiler<00:01:03.100> kinda<00:01:03.519> like<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.670> parachute

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
reverse spoiler kinda like a parachute

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750 
reverse spoiler kinda like a parachute
in<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.390> water<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.440> really<00:01:05.799> grabs<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.340> lot<00:01:06.580> of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
in the water so it really grabs a lot of

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.030 
in the water so it really grabs a lot of
water<00:01:06.970> creating<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.600> lot<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.870> drag<00:01:08.170> but<00:01:08.920> it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
water creating a lot of drag but it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.550 
water creating a lot of drag but it
pulls<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.610> watercraft<00:01:10.150> from<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.600> back<00:01:10.870> so

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
pulls the watercraft from the back so

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.010 
pulls the watercraft from the back so
the<00:01:11.680> riders<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.190> total<00:01:12.610> control<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.510> it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
the riders in total control and it

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.870 
the riders in total control and it
brings<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.410> watercraft<00:01:14.800> to<00:01:15.040> a<00:01:15.070> stop<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.640> about

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
brings the watercraft to a stop in about

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.580 
brings the watercraft to a stop in about
half<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.390> distance<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:17.020> a<00:01:17.200> watercraft

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
half the distance of a watercraft

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.830 
half the distance of a watercraft
without<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.280> system

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.929 

one<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.560> unique<00:01:21.799> features<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.430> IVR

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
one of the unique features of the IVR

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.450 
one of the unique features of the IVR
system<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.840> starts<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.500> neutral<00:01:25.009> that's<00:01:25.250> a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
system is it starts in neutral that's a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.490 
system is it starts in neutral that's a
new<00:01:25.640> feature<00:01:26.049> traditionally<00:01:27.049> watercraft

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
new feature traditionally watercraft

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.859 
new feature traditionally watercraft
alloys<00:01:27.799> started<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.369> Ford<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.240> again<00:01:29.720> the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
alloys started in Ford so again the

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.690 
alloys started in Ford so again the
rider<00:01:30.049> has<00:01:30.289> more<00:01:30.590> control<00:01:30.920> by<00:01:31.220> starting<00:01:31.610> in

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
rider has more control by starting in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.910 
rider has more control by starting in
neutral<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.299> it's<00:01:32.869> super<00:01:33.289> easy<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.619> code<00:01:33.890> a

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
neutral and it's super easy to code a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.340 
neutral and it's super easy to code a
forward<00:01:34.399> neutral<00:01:34.789> reverse<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> handlebar

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350

simply pull the lever all the way in to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.820 
simply pull the lever all the way in to
be<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.570> neutral<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.049> let<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.439> go

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
be in neutral you let it go

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.620 
be in neutral you let it go
and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.250> going<00:01:43.520> forward<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:44.030> simply<00:01:44.360> top

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then to going forward you simply top

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.730 
and then to going forward you simply top
the<00:01:44.810> throttle<00:01:45.229> lever<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.710> away<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:47.740> one
