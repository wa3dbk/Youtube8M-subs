00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
would take into account cost and weight

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.439 
would take into account cost and weight
all<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.710> issues<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:51.000> spoke

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
now those two bags that I spoke about

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.220 
now those two bags that I spoke about
the<00:00:58.590> last<00:00:58.800> time<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> rag<00:00:59.460> bag<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.510> neutrino

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the last time the rag bag the neutrino

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.109 
the last time the rag bag the neutrino
600<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.480> snow<00:01:03.480> packs<00:01:04.129> Antarctica<00:01:05.129> re<00:01:05.369> they

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
600 and snow packs Antarctica re they

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
600 and snow packs Antarctica re they
were<00:01:06.180> extreme<00:01:06.990> bags<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.710> extreme<00:01:08.220> conditions

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
were extreme bags for extreme conditions

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109 
were extreme bags for extreme conditions
you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.409> re<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> minus

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you know the the re is is good to minus

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.130 
you know the the re is is good to minus
50<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.860> Rabb<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.549> good<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> minus<00:01:15.840> 30

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
50 and the Rabb is good to minus 30

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
50 and the Rabb is good to minus 30
we're<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.700> those<00:01:17.939> conditions

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
we're not going to have those conditions

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
we're not going to have those conditions
in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> UK<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:20.360> would<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> UK<00:01:22.290> you're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
in the UK I would say in the UK you're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
in the UK I would say in the UK you're
you're<00:01:24.210> likely<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:25.490> most<00:01:26.490> winters<00:01:27.530> minus<00:01:28.530> 10

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you're likely to most winters minus 10

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
you're likely to most winters minus 10
minus<00:01:29.549> 12

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
minus 12

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140 
minus 12
that's<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> find<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.520> as

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that's what you're going to find so as

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.460 
that's what you're going to find so as
you<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.570> more<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:33.930> extreme<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> cost

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
you go more and more extreme the cost

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.069 
you go more and more extreme the cost
implication<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.740> greater<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.509> wanted<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
implication is greater so I wanted to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
implication is greater so I wanted to
give<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.899> what<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.369> best<00:01:44.729> winter

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
give you what I think is the best winter

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
give you what I think is the best winter
bag<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.500> UK<00:01:46.920> conditions<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> you
