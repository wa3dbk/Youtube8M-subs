00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
do is end up with a technology helpdesk

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.740 
do is end up with a technology helpdesk
right<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.730> help<00:02:24.940> their<00:02:25.090> consumer<00:02:25.540> with

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
implementing the technology and asking

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.610 
implementing the technology and asking
questions<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.239> well<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.660> updated<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
questions like well have you updated the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.590 
questions like well have you updated the
latest<00:02:29.980> operating<00:02:30.340> system<00:02:30.459> for<00:02:31.030> your<00:02:31.180> android

phone<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.920> we're<00:02:33.100> really<00:02:33.340> trying<00:02:33.609> to<00:02:33.730> solve

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
phone so we're really trying to solve

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.120 
phone so we're really trying to solve
the<00:02:34.299> consumer<00:02:34.720> side<00:02:34.900> technology<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.100> that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the consumer side technology so that

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.170 
the consumer side technology so that
everybody<00:02:36.459> else<00:02:36.549> can<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.880> what<00:02:37.060> they're

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
everybody else can get what they're

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.610 
everybody else can get what they're
really<00:02:37.420> trying<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> get<00:02:38.019> which<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.350> deeper

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
really trying to get which is a deeper

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.890 
really trying to get which is a deeper
relationship<00:02:38.739> with<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.310> consumer

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.539 

as<00:02:44.290> much<00:02:44.530> as<00:02:44.560> I've<00:02:44.799> talked<00:02:45.010> about<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
as much as I've talked about in a

merchant's broadly issuers broadly you
know<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.069> real<00:02:48.189> question<00:02:48.640> today<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.390> know

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
know the real question today you know

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
know the real question today you know
with<00:02:49.689> this<00:02:49.840> audience<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.739> know<00:02:50.829> how<00:02:51.189> does

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
with this audience is you know how does

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.789 
with this audience is you know how does
this<00:02:51.400> fit<00:02:51.579> into<00:02:51.640> transit<00:02:52.180> now<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.620> good<00:02:53.739> news

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
this fit into transit now the good news

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.640 
this fit into transit now the good news
is<00:02:54.159> that<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.299> talk<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.659> consumers<00:02:55.959> about

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
is that when we talk to consumers about

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.559 
is that when we talk to consumers about
the<00:02:56.709> mobile<00:02:57.129> wallet<00:02:57.430> technology<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
the mobile wallet technology and the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.140 
the mobile wallet technology and the
concept<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.700> eighty-six<00:03:00.700> percent<00:03:00.760> of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
concept really eighty-six percent of

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.849 
concept really eighty-six percent of
them<00:03:01.239> say<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.480> they<00:03:01.720> would<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.319> like<00:03:02.739> to

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
them say that they would like to like to

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.380 
them say that they would like to like to
use<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.370> mean<00:03:03.519> they're<00:03:03.640> big<00:03:03.879> fans<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
use it so I mean they're big fans of the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.929 
use it so I mean they're big fans of the
topic<00:03:05.109> but<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.220> key<00:03:06.400> questions<00:03:06.579> they

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
topic but one of the key questions they

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.509 
topic but one of the key questions they
ask<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.540> really<00:03:07.930> will<00:03:08.290> guard<00:03:08.590> engage<00:03:09.129> their

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
ask that really will guard engage their

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.869 
ask that really will guard engage their
their<00:03:09.879> use<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.950> where<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.159> use<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.489> right

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
their use is where can I use it right

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.250 
their use is where can I use it right
it's<00:03:13.060> great<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:13.359> I've<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.599> this<00:03:13.720> technology

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
it's great that I've got this technology

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's great that I've got this technology
on<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.379> handset<00:03:14.799> but<00:03:15.519> which<00:03:15.700> merchants

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
on the handset but which merchants

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.780 
on the handset but which merchants
accept<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.629> where<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.019> use<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.409> and<00:03:17.790> really

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
accept it where can I use it and really

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.180 
accept it where can I use it and really
what<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.000> comes<00:03:19.090> down<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.829> frequency<00:03:20.829> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
what it comes down to is frequency and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.710 
what it comes down to is frequency and
volume<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.700> transactions<00:03:22.359> that's<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.629> way

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
volume of transactions that's the way

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.599 
volume of transactions that's the way
the<00:03:22.810> consumer<00:03:23.170> ultimately<00:03:23.650> measures<00:03:24.069> utility

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
the consumer ultimately measures utility

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.089 
the consumer ultimately measures utility
so<00:03:25.060> if<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.209> do<00:03:25.269> 20<00:03:25.629> transactions<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.319> week<00:03:26.500> how

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
so if I do 20 transactions a week how

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.009 
so if I do 20 transactions a week how
many<00:03:27.159> of<00:03:27.400> those<00:03:27.549> can<00:03:27.849> I<00:03:27.909> use<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.659> technology

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
many of those can I use this technology

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.580 
many of those can I use this technology
how<00:03:29.470> many<00:03:29.590> places<00:03:29.799> can<00:03:29.980> i<00:03:30.159> tap<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.730> pay<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
how many places can i tap and pay and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.289 
how many places can i tap and pay and
transit<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.739> one<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.400> few<00:03:33.670> merchant

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
transit is one of the few merchant

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.420 
transit is one of the few merchant
verticals<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.019> can<00:03:35.200> kind<00:03:35.409> of<00:03:35.470> call<00:03:35.920> transit

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
verticals if I can kind of call transit

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.119 
verticals if I can kind of call transit
a<00:03:36.489> merchant<00:03:36.819> vertical<00:03:37.209> where<00:03:37.959> consumers<00:03:38.680> for

a merchant vertical where consumers for
those<00:03:39.250> who<00:03:39.400> use<00:03:39.579> it<00:03:39.790> use<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.090> twice<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.750> day

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
those who use it use it twice a day

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.740 
those who use it use it twice a day
that's<00:03:41.680> unbelievable<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:42.519> know<00:03:42.549> even<00:03:42.849> coffee
