 or the hunter is welcome back to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.230
 barbie channel good, well, in this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.230
 occasion for today's video we bring you 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.330
 a monster of these new ones proved 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.369
 campus 4 val in the subspecies of kirk and 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.410
 of the kirin we already know that it is not new 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.809
 but the subspecies of kirin yes it is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.050
 new here in the monster hunter 4 at 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.989
 appears for the first time in this game 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.370
 and well then what to tell you that it is a 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.050
 guild treasure search mission 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 and that is level 100 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.160
 and well now we are going to face 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.590
 to this new kirin 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.960
 and now you will see how is the truth is that 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.339
 I like it better than normal killing 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.810
 although he continues 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.810
 so being a beach and still 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.030
 and let's see how it develops 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.799
 fight because as I told you is level 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.430
 100 of these missions search 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.759
 treasures and good level monsters 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.170
 100 so you have to be careful because of 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.170
 a blow can kill 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.920
 Well, here we have our 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.820
 rearing horse that you see is 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.820
 black 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.830
 I like it more than killing white 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.740
 and good instead of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.480
 of having thunder element attacks 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.480
 has ice elements attacks 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.259
 and we have these kicks of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.259
 tip 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.439
 and well already here you know what what 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.910
 you have to do several other missions 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.910
 of treasure hunt that I have 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 commented then you have to try not to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.300
 hit us 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.210
 you have to try not to get hit 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.630
 and always watch as life has it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.550
 as much as possible 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.950
 later to avoid possible scares 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
 what is here we are going to place some 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.129
 bombs 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.129
 and there it is 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 with wine 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.330
 and come 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.730
 and we launch here again as 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.209
 piranhas of all to hit the area 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.209
 head 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.330
 and we're going to finish off with a ride 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.140
 is that he is a foal of these savages of 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.140
 total rodeo 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.000
 and how it turns 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.140
 there is little left there is perfect 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.250
 Riding accomplished successfully shit like 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.730
 states my colleagues waiting 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.230
 they were there waiting for me to finish 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.680
 and all running in the area of ​​the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.680
 head 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 this good you know about him 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.590
 the other video for example from obama that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.140
 we do not have to let him breathe because 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.790
 we let him breathe and see how my 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.080
 partner who has eaten fully the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.650
 attack 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.579
 of miracle has not died 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.680
 as you can see, they make deadly attacks and I've 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.140
 seen in the background that we had a guest 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.970
 surprise to combat 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.810
 but it's a little monster that has come to 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.810
 that keep us company 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.030
 is 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.570
 look at it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.920
 luckily the circle of the shadow that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.920
 goes 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.340
 thank goodness because what we were missing 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.070
 here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.430
 and other monsters more touching the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.430
 noses as the weapon bounces 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.710
 dressed city is hitting nothing to life 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.710
 run Run 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.920
 and another one 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.530
 now I can already lose 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.530
 by aquino that bounces there 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.949
 and beating is finally falling super 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.470
 species there they have fallen has already fallen 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.550
 good as you see we have not left him 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.410
 breathe because at a time there that has 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.330
 breathed and has launched an attack of 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.860
 ice there was one of my classmates by the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.750
 medium and good almost almost kills him has 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.370
 left with nothing of life has killed him 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.520
 a lie also there that has lowered me 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.310
 a lot of life and I would like you 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.320
 fixed and we always go the whole group 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.870
 dodging frontal attacks 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.300
 trying to attack from the sides and 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.380
 in the back so that he will catch us 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.639
 full 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.030
 Well, this has been to acquire supe 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.340
 species 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.770
 As I told you, it's like kirin 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.210
 only that element launches attack of 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.820
 ice element and nothing has been here has 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.139
 taken out not to let him breathe either 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.720
 nothing hunters I hope that I have 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.970
