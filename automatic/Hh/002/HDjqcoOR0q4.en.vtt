more impressive I think is their point
differential<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:39.059> point<00:00:39.690> 9<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.160> huge

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
differential well point 9 that is a huge

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.000 
differential well point 9 that is a huge
point<00:00:42.090> differential<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:43.020> there<00:00:43.410> multiple

believe the second overall team behind
the<00:01:51.560> Chicago<00:01:51.710> Bulls<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.910> for<00:01:53.120> now<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.720> time

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the Chicago Bulls but for now it is time

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.320 
the Chicago Bulls but for now it is time
to<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.380> if<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.070> actually<00:01:55.490> have<00:01:55.700> what<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.150> takes

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
to see if we actually have what it takes

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.650 
to see if we actually have what it takes
to<00:01:56.630> compete<00:01:57.080> against<00:01:57.800> this<00:01:57.950> team<00:01:58.250> not<00:01:58.970> only<00:01:59.360> do

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
to compete against this team not only do

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.230 
to compete against this team not only do
they<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.380> many<00:02:00.560> weapons<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.340> offense<00:02:01.790> but

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
they have so many weapons on offense but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240 
they have so many weapons on offense but
they<00:02:02.390> also<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.990> plenty<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.560> weapons<00:02:04.100> on

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
they also have plenty of weapons on

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.370 
they also have plenty of weapons on
defense<00:02:04.730> as<00:02:04.940> well<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.750> we<00:02:05.900> need<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.320> sure

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
defense as well so we need to make sure

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.919 
defense as well so we need to make sure
that<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.280> our<00:02:07.700> players<00:02:08.030> are<00:02:08.330> bringing

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
their a-game tonight and talking about a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.449 
their a-game tonight and talking about a
game<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> huge<00:02:12.020> snap<00:02:12.350> song<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:13.070> Julius

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
game that is a huge snap song for Julius

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.400 
game that is a huge snap song for Julius
Randle<00:02:13.880> right<00:02:14.090> there<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.870> couldn't<00:02:15.260> have

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
Randle right there and I couldn't have

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.860 
Randle right there and I couldn't have
pictured<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:16.130> better<00:02:16.459> start<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.150> him<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.510> is

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
pictured a better start for him it is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.199 
pictured a better start for him it is
always<00:02:18.290> great<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.980> him<00:02:19.130> catch<00:02:19.430> fire<00:02:19.760> early

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
always great to see him catch fire early

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.360 
always great to see him catch fire early
on<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.630> game<00:02:20.870> because<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.740> translates

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
on in this game because that translates

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.390 
on in this game because that translates
into<00:02:22.640> his<00:02:22.910> efforts<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.660> grabbing<00:02:24.200> rebounds<00:02:24.800> it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
into his efforts in grabbing rebounds it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490 
into his efforts in grabbing rebounds it
seems<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.880> when<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.420> get<00:02:26.600> Julius<00:02:27.050> Randle

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
seems like when you get Julius Randle

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.920 
seems like when you get Julius Randle
more<00:02:27.860> involved<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.459> offense<00:02:28.940> he<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
more involved in offense he is going to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.199 
more involved in offense he is going to
seek<00:02:30.140> out<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.590> put<00:02:30.830> up<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.160> whole<00:02:31.520> lot<00:02:31.940> more

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
seek out and put up a whole lot more

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.630 
seek out and put up a whole lot more
effort<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.750> grab<00:02:33.080> those<00:02:33.290> rebounds<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.250> us<00:02:34.370> as

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
effort to grab those rebounds for us as

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.780 
effort to grab those rebounds for us as
a<00:02:34.970> team<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:35.959> now<00:02:36.260> we<00:02:36.620> are<00:02:36.650> down<00:02:36.980> by<00:02:37.190> 7<00:02:37.670> at
