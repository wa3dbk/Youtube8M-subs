00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 apocalypse for the planet 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.369
 space puzzles 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.970
 solar radiation to new land 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.720
 temperature on the planet is taken 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.970
 court statement 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 with 27 in a speech at this is your goal and go for it all 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.119
 sake for frying 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.509
 many are afraid of plants 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.759
 continents turns into 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.339
 lifeless desert 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.089
 this is not the script of the next movie 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.870
 horror 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930
 from the fighters after a few centuries 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.580
 and blame 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 we are with you and with everyone 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.980
 about 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.010
 Earth's magnetic field forming a national team 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 but they don't 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990
 impossible to see and feel 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.400
 he is humanity dependent 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.610
 according to strong cosmic rays still 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.610
 not burned the earth just thanks 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.840
 we live in this constantly 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.250
 expanding 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.190
 crown the sun with the father the sun every hour 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.480
 emissions of more than seven billion tons 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.090
 and plasma and play this late when 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 interacts with the earth by a magnetic field 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 it forms 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 protocol cavity we call washed spheres 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 few people know every second 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 toward the earth 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850
 7 tons of radiation 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 it's hard 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.750
 able to penetrate the cells and instantly 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.600
 kill dna man 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 at tremendous speed they rush towards 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 land and necessarily burned her report 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 but we get her way trap magnetic 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.760
 field it repels radiation makes 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.880
 flow of cosmic rays around all 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.130
 but who is we have a magnetic field if 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.649
 not addicted once the ball particles in the city have 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.220
 not all veterans could in march on 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.800
 the field will unfold 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.320
 in this fight delay at the end of the show hold 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.900
 on 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.810
 some moment and therefore 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 Earth's magnetic field is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.860
 in Caucasian over indexing to such 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.539
 by name 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.339
 t on the one hand so magnetic 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.199
 charged particle mirror 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.430
 project and it gives the court to give can even 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.449
 predict results in whether it will 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.469
 such a magnetic trap 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.299
 this is aurora 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.370
 one of the wonders of the world 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.930
 and a constant reminder of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.899
 magnetic field charges 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.689
 bright flashes are nothing but 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.959
 Earth's magnetosphere resistance 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.229
 solar wind 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.279
 magnetic order in the Antarctic region 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.149
 higher than in other regions 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.469
 and we can help and watch 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 depressed church earth 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.909
 about 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.120
 until recently, scientists are not much 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.829
 were interested in magnetic issues 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:54.369
 of fields 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.919
 it seemed all the major discoveries have already been made 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.659
 three people completely subjugated 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.249
 imagine the magnetosphere 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.059
 it turned out that not for long 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.509
 a few years ago physics scientists noticed 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.169
 that the magnetic poles started accelerated 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.979
 movement towards 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.239
 answers inexplicable guys began to study 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.369
 catastrophic 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.209
 over the past 100 years the north magnetic 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 pole reduce the price of 900 kilometers 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.889
 and after 50 years 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.309
 move online 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.209
 this will lead to permanently magnetic 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.329
 storms over eastern Siberia and gradually 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.329
 turning it from a snowy plain 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.139
 to which radiation died 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.779
 the same thing happens with the south 1 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.049
 with her as if to peak Americans 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.489
 who opened from Antarctica stations on 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.159
 geographic polish means 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.319
 the Soviet Union opens the shore with 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.459
 stations east over southern geomagnetic 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 poland 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.009
 so now hematite and polis 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.339
 far gone already from this station goblet yes 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.839
 too, the specialists begin to creep into Indian 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.469
 ocean 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.459
 movement of magnetic fields every year 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.229
 is accelerating 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.789
 most of the last century 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.039
 the magnetosphere shifted by 10 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.979
 kilometers race from the end of 1970 is 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.569
 speed increased 4 times 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.479
 if you slow down 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.109
 poles 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.189
 that the magnetic field on earth will soon disappear 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.389
 which means life threatening 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.430
 radiation 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
 will certainly fall 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.139
 But if in moments of magnetic field versions 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.590
 land 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.830
 generally pass through zero 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.810
 it will not be according to him 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.229
 it turns out that we are defenseless before 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.650
 solar plasma streams in space 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.930
 rays and this will lead to what we have there 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.360
 glaciers will melt away all life will perish in the port 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.539
 flow into category 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.449
 annihilating radiation 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.190
 on this graphic model 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.600
 we see yellow and blue frost they 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.950
 belong to the south and north magnetic 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.669
 the pole 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.560
 when magnetic geographic 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.749
 poles match 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.059
 and here is what we see today 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.489
 when moving magnetic fields on 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:06.419
 meeting 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.490
 in bilina begin to get confused 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.389
 that means two magnetic poles 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 will remain 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.689
 but so far so supposed 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.259
 the universe script if we allow this version 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:20.910
 state council 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.890
 the field has already worked its fields 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.050
 character and just will be in 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.940
 Mostly and here from such something big 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 anomalies then any attempts 300 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.789
 scientists are sure magnetic more 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.479
 sweet with every second 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.400
 no man makes trouble 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.380
 for example the Atlantic Ocean 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.790
 near the shores of brazil here is no longer 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.300
 searches are denied 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.749
 navigation device 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.409
 need homeless all banned 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.039
 space flights 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.969
 ironically and in the first victim 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.960
 danger zone of the sez dolgan satellite 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.449
 designed to measure magnetic 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.099
 fields of earth 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.709
 scientists have already called this region in the south 

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:59.759
 Atlantic herself okay today she 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.479
 occupies 8 million square 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.229
 kilometers and increasing all the time 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.339
 the airline is already today 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.159
 lay your routes away from 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.129
 abnormal zones very soon in this region 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.129
 lack of budgetary organizations 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.490
 e 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.639
 answer the question how it works 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.059
 wild field of land 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.059
 but not broken 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:28.259
 scientists unfortunately not yet 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.259
 if in the next few dozen 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.589
 years old 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:33.449
 humanity
