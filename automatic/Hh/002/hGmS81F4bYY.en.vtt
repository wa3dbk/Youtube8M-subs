00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.070
 well now we will start with the tutorial 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 of how to configure a virtual host 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.860
 windows 8 use friends 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 in the step is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 of taking out the saint is very simple 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.570
 to lugo 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 we download windows 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.100
 is talk we go down this file good 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.600
 97 I will spend molar I have it 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.619
 running 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.450
 let's run this as you can see this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.670
 has a control panel that has several 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.190
 services now we are interested in using the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.080
 apache which is the web server 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.290
 at this moment he is not there when he is 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.710
 working we are in stock is already 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.010
 running to check we're going to the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.160
 localhost path 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.320
 this is the configuration site by 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.020
 defect that the samp has 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.079
 but we do not want that we 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.850
 we want to use a domain that we 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.190
 indicates towards a folder of our 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.420
 machine where we can put here 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.130
 our html files 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.740
 at this time this is a line that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.540
 let's use the host value in this 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.580
 moment in office because simply 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.140
 we have not checked anything 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.040
 the first step that we have to do is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 modify the file 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.550
 who is here 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.920
 is 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.150
 in minutes 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.150
 there are 32 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 rivers 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.480
 etc this hosts file but to do it 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 we have to open 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.650
 we will not have to leave edit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.940
 use this a text editor and 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.940
 execute it as administrator 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.900
 we can use our in this case I use 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.330
 external to the plants they click 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.970
 right the executable and can execute 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.090
 as administrator 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.209
 I do not have running here 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.870
 and the hosts file comes with this data 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.980
 for affection what we want to do is this 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.840
 of the own machine always the same 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.569
 we have add a new record this 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.799
 is let's say the domain that is used for that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.799
 that when we put other things 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.580
 the shipments in our machine but 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.620
 we want many new resemblance but 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.680
 with a new domain that is the one 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.110
 we want to buy in mini p the wefts 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.580
 domains that we want to add and for what 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 because this domino is already working 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.310
 we put it in our browser and we 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.990
 redirects towards the same page what is 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.970
 that's a good thing but not what 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.550
 we want we want this domain to 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.710
 direct to a different folder of 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.500
 our 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.890
 in our machine for this we have to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.000
 modify the file 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.270
 apache with extra http from our host 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.270
 dot com 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.750
 and here there is already a fruit jose example 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.380
 but that these do not work because they are 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.560
 commented with these 5 numeral 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.620
 add a new record 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.690
 and here in the important parts not that 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580
 we have to take into account is in the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.349
 document section that says good in 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.450
 the path of the folder where it will be 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.060
 our website and another sector 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.150
 important is to be on in the we impose the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.840
 same domain that we have entered in the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.840
 host file 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.280
 well this section is to give permissions 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.780
 to apache so you can read this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.780
 folder we keep 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.970
 and let's follow applause 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
 redirects us to the place because 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.650
 because it has not changed if we have 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.000
 modified configuration files 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.069
 simply because the apache is 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.500
 executed with the previous configuration 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.670
 to use the configuration was 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.460
 we have to restart it we are going to stop 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.210
 start 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.210
 and another 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.459
 now the child is heading towards the 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.459
 binder 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.060
 since it is public html 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.330
 Well, the same thing that I want appears 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.310
 in my file 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.430
 but which one will feel to have virtual host 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.430
 is to have several domains that 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.319
 our own machine works 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.070
 to prove that we're going to create a new one 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.260
 plus 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.050
 as I said first step is to modify the 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.210
 host file 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.129
 we put the blow always the same 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.810
 We put the new domain that we want 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.280
 so it works 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.160
 to check that Sunday is 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.920
 working well we save the file and 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.530
 we try on the tasty 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.320
 and it directs us towards it, not towards 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.790
 another eye that we have created but we 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.780
 we want that we want that new 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.639
 domain directs us to another folder 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.960
 for this we have to modify the 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:20.460
 http file to pacheco extra http meters 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.150
 and we have to give another similar record 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.460
 not this one but with the new routes with 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.160
 the new folder and with the new one they put 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.540
 with a new domain 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.760
 as you can see here in this file 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.100
 is there are glasses 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.050
 The only thing that varies is the document and the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.480
 serranillo as you see it changed 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.680
 towards the new routes a new folder 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.680
 Of domain 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.800
 I save it 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.680
 but it does not change because as we said the 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.650
 apache is running with the 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.910
 previous configuration to run 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.889
 the changes we have made in the 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.979
 configuration we have to restart it 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.729
 let's go to the control panel of the sunp we have 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:09.240
 the service we return to start is 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.240
 all right we are now 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.380
 this is the folder that we have loaded with 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.740
 the new domain like 20 and we're another 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.740
 content 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.449
 and if I go to the previous domain 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.480
 also that option 'no 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.610
 here we have one 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.930
 we have another and so we can have 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.460
 multiple sites running our 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.700
 own machine using apache and 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.700
 I hope you serve them
