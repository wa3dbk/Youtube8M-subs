00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.710
 we have been pretty good 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 our counter situation is quite good 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.639
 played against also earned 2 0 in 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.950
 leadership we have not approved 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.590
 then after the half time pretty under 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 have risked distress for darmstadt 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 We are against it and then after 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 ten fifteen minutes back into play 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 Come in and have our counter 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.260
 situation then partly better 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.960
 play 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.550
 Annoyingly, the 2 1 but hardly with 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.410
 a 3 1 back and just fine i have to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
 tell you the first half was real 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 great we have delivered here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 the second half we have at the beginning 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.730
 a little bit weakened but for one 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 we did the 3 1 that was all 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.530
 important to us the actions of the super 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 Made and so on Monday 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 Of course in two play at the beginning 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 darmstadt was already very good in the game 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 The first 20 minutes are in there too 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.149
 put a lot of pressure on us though 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 we have kept very well against and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 I deserve that, too 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.020
 1 0 and the 2 0 shot up to the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 also keep the lead at half-time 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 but then you have seen that darmstadt 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.280
 also an unpleasant team is with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.260
 their big people do 21 and afterwards 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.310
 then we are thank god again 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.630
 through the third gate then stop too 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.650
 again a bit in calm waters 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.939
 hazards 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.110
 that was hugely important until 10.10 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.280
 have known that game 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.350
 Darmstadt a lot with long balls 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 But that works quite well under control 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.090
 I get and I believe too 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.180
 earn a little in the lead and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.619
 reward us then and then in the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.909
 say half time we did that we 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 wanting to play it is not quite 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.729
 Risen but so beautiful means that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.119
 We then there is even more 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.100
 can 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.710
 I think we just have the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 chances we have our game and it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.130
 we were all ice cold 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.360
 used and we just got it right 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.280
 had stood well 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.810
 when I see him like that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.840
 felix burmeister arne feicks meets there 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.399
 Rear really super cool defended 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 have that really fun heard but 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.020
 everyone in the network has a good game 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.000
 made 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 yes I think it will all be a little bit 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.860
 overvalued is only protect 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.090
 straw-angel 22 players and more there 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.619
 standing in the square yes we have one 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.899
 year in babelsberg game and we are 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.849
 good friends and write and 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.280
 but often call that is the goal 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.069
 In the 90 minutes not everyone plays for 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.239
 his club and that's good 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.150
 yes we still have the game on monday 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.540
 and then you go and then you are 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.940
 all good 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.350
 first madness thank you how many fans 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.720
 here are great 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.730
 support and then monday will be 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.440
 the osnabrück will play again 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.940
 i believe from the last one 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.260
 So I 'm looking forward to one 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.299
 full cottage and on animal 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.489
 Enthusiasm from those of our fans 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.049
 I really expect something from the fans 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.040
 but I am always glad that you have so many 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.019
 then come and that's a pity 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.160
 Sold out is the hammer I'm looking forward to 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.140
 me even mother and especially 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.090
 that we are up to 31 in the back then higher 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.440
 can start but it will not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.370
 easier the darmstädter would be 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.560
 normally put everything in the pan 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.519
 but we play at home and we will 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.280
 put everything against it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.350
 i know our fans are out there stadium 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.630
 will shake and we will move forward 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.040
 whip and will take us 90 minutes 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.090
 we support our goal 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.090
 achieved together
