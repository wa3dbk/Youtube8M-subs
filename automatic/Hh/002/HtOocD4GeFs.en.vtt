into<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.580> game<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.850> think<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.780> TLO<00:00:04.140> needs<00:00:04.319> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
game I would have thought for sure that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.289 
game I would have thought for sure that
was<00:01:03.629> GG<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.680> somehow<00:01:05.010> said<00:01:05.460> cooling<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> cat

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
was GG but somehow said cooling the cat

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.929 
was GG but somehow said cooling the cat
out<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> bag<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.590> killed<00:01:08.040> several<00:01:08.400> suvs

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
out of the bag has killed several suvs

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.600 
out of the bag has killed several suvs
the<00:01:09.270> harvester<00:01:09.720> count<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.650> gap<00:01:11.040> has<00:01:11.340> been

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the harvester count now the gap has been

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.530 
the harvester count now the gap has been
narrowed<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.510> 32<00:01:13.020> under<00:01:13.320> 37<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.210> don't

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
narrowed to 32 under 37 and I just don't

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
narrowed to 32 under 37 and I just don't
know<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> point<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.460> game

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
know I I think at this point the game

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570 
know I I think at this point the game
might<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.390> reset<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.650> balanced

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
might just have reset it to a balanced

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
might just have reset it to a balanced
position<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:22.890> TLO<00:01:23.369> could

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
position I just don't see how TLO could

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
position I just don't see how TLO could
could<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.390> his<00:01:24.509> advantage<00:01:24.930> after<00:01:25.110> losing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
could have his advantage after losing

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100 
could have his advantage after losing
the<00:01:25.740> dropship<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.150> Thor<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the dropship and the Thor that's like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.390 
the dropship and the Thor that's like
everything<00:01:28.560> he's<00:01:28.680> been<00:01:28.829> saving<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.220> that's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
everything he's been saving up that's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.810 
everything he's been saving up that's
like<00:01:29.549> his<00:01:29.700> entire<00:01:29.909> army<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.670> right

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like his entire army so I think right

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.249 
like his entire army so I think right
now<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> game<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.270> reset<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> very

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
now the game has reset to a very

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
now the game has reset to a very
balanced<00:01:34.650> state<00:01:34.890> TLO<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.970> needs<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
balanced state TLO really needs to be

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
balanced state TLO really needs to be
careful<00:01:36.600> i<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.930> hacked<00:01:37.140> i<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.530> actually

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
careful i would hacked i would actually

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
careful i would hacked i would actually
put<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bunker<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.970> rather<00:01:39.450> than<00:01:39.630> here

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
put a bunker right here rather than here

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.870 
put a bunker right here rather than here
this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> gap<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.430> speedlings

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this is still a gap that the speedlings

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.539 
this is still a gap that the speedlings
can<00:01:42.030> exploit<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.140> five<00:01:43.590> hellions

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
can exploit now there are five hellions

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.050 
can exploit now there are five hellions
coming<00:01:44.909> across<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.270> map<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.350> the

coming across a map they do have the
environmentally<00:01:48.060> ignitor<00:01:48.570> upgrade<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.530> we'll

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
environmentally ignitor upgrade so we'll

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.139 
environmentally ignitor upgrade so we'll
see<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> damage<00:01:50.610> he's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> be

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.640 
affect any kind of critical damage
because<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.030> fact<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.480> tloz<00:04:51.110> got<00:04:51.470> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
because of the fact that tloz got a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.440 
because of the fact that tloz got a
bunch<00:04:52.100> of<00:04:52.280> Thor's<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:52.730> position<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.300> map

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
bunch of Thor's in position on the map

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.120 
bunch of Thor's in position on the map
now<00:04:53.840> these<00:04:53.990> mutants<00:04:54.440> are<00:04:54.560> gonna<00:04:54.710> come<00:04:54.890> in<00:04:55.010> and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
now these mutants are gonna come in and

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.310 
now these mutants are gonna come in and
try<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.400> pick<00:04:55.580> off<00:04:55.760> some<00:04:55.880> SUVs<00:04:56.030> let's<00:04:56.540> keep<00:04:57.170> an

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
try to pick off some SUVs let's keep an

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.560 
try to pick off some SUVs let's keep an
eye<00:04:57.500> on<00:04:57.530> that<00:04:57.860> harvester<00:04:58.310> count<00:04:58.550> they<00:04:59.000> are<00:04:59.240> not

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
eye on that harvester count they are not

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.450 
eye on that harvester count they are not
dropping<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.170> haven't<00:05:00.440> seen<00:05:00.530> any<00:05:00.740> stds<00:05:01.190> drop

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
dropping I haven't seen any stds drop

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.240 
dropping I haven't seen any stds drop
yet<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.840> looks<00:05:03.050> like<00:05:03.170> well<00:05:03.710> I'm<00:05:04.040> not<00:05:04.190> sure

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
yet and it looks like well I'm not sure

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.710 
yet and it looks like well I'm not sure
why<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.640> harvester<00:05:05.060> count<00:05:05.270> didn't<00:05:05.570> drop

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
why the harvester count didn't drop

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.140 
why the harvester count didn't drop
there<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.170> definitely<00:05:06.530> saw<00:05:06.920> a<00:05:06.950> couple<00:05:07.190> suvs<00:05:08.120> go

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
there I definitely saw a couple suvs go

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.500 
there I definitely saw a couple suvs go
down<00:05:09.130> probably<00:05:10.130> there<00:05:10.640> we<00:05:10.760> go<00:05:10.910> so<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.150> guess<00:05:11.240> it

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
down probably there we go so I guess it

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.930 
down probably there we go so I guess it
updates<00:05:11.840> maybe<00:05:12.170> once<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.560> minute<00:05:12.830> 55<00:05:13.310> under<00:05:13.580> 60

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
updates maybe once a minute 55 under 60

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.410 
updates maybe once a minute 55 under 60
there<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> let's<00:05:16.250> see<00:05:16.460> what<00:05:16.670> TLO<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.150> going<00:05:17.360> to

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
there so let's see what TLO is going to

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.060 
there so let's see what TLO is going to
be<00:05:17.510> able<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.780> do<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.080> looks<00:05:18.260> like<00:05:18.440> he<00:05:18.620> does<00:05:18.860> have

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
be able to do it looks like he does have

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.590 
be able to do it looks like he does have
another<00:05:19.370> command<00:05:19.760> center<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.570> is

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
another command center and it is

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.990 
another command center and it is
floating<00:05:21.200> off<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.500> go<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:21.800> what<00:05:22.310> seems<00:05:22.670> to<00:05:22.970> be

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
floating off to go to what seems to be

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.990 
floating off to go to what seems to be
the<00:05:23.330> three<00:05:23.930> o'clock<00:05:24.200> gold<00:05:24.620> meanwhile<00:05:25.400> sin<00:05:25.820> has

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
the three o'clock gold meanwhile sin has

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.580 
the three o'clock gold meanwhile sin has
been<00:05:26.180> mining<00:05:26.570> happily<00:05:27.080> off<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.470> this

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
been mining happily off of this

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.890 
been mining happily off of this
expansion<00:05:28.010> he<00:05:28.400> has<00:05:28.520> getting<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.030> lot<00:05:29.360> of<00:05:29.390> income

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
expansion he has getting a lot of income

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.380 
expansion he has getting a lot of income
from<00:05:30.350> this<00:05:30.560> gold<00:05:30.800> Expo<00:05:31.160> so<00:05:31.370> TLO<00:05:31.730> really<00:05:32.150> needs

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
from this gold Expo so TLO really needs

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.000 
from this gold Expo so TLO really needs
to<00:05:32.990> make<00:05:33.200> something<00:05:33.440> happen<00:05:33.650> with<00:05:33.920> this

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
to make something happen with this

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.440 
to make something happen with this
expansion<00:05:34.400> he<00:05:34.610> cannot<00:05:34.880> allow<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.210> Zerg

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
expansion he cannot allow the Zerg

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.210 
expansion he cannot allow the Zerg
player<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:35.810> hold<00:05:35.990> on<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.200> three<00:05:36.380> bases<00:05:36.740> he<00:05:37.070> is

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
player to hold on the three bases he is

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.920 
player to hold on the three bases he is
gonna<00:05:37.460> move<00:05:37.580> in<00:05:37.760> with<00:05:37.790> these<00:05:38.090> aliens<00:05:38.570> but<00:05:38.750> he's

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
gonna move in with these aliens but he's

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.960 
gonna move in with these aliens but he's
going<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.200> encounter<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.620> wall<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.310> roach<00:05:40.640> and

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
going to encounter the wall of roach and

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.480 
going to encounter the wall of roach and
that<00:05:41.600> is<00:05:41.780> a<00:05:41.810> pretty<00:05:42.230> strong<00:05:42.380> wall<00:05:42.860> against

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
that is a pretty strong wall against

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.570 
that is a pretty strong wall against
Hellion<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.090> TLO<00:05:44.540> actually<00:05:45.260> gonna<00:05:45.410> swap<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.250> I

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
Hellion so TLO actually gonna swap and I

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.130 
Hellion so TLO actually gonna swap and I
guess<00:05:47.120> he's<00:05:47.300> gonna<00:05:47.420> try<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.720> grab<00:05:47.990> this

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
guess he's gonna try to grab this

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.830 
guess he's gonna try to grab this
expansion<00:05:48.530> I'm<00:05:48.740> not<00:05:48.950> sure<00:05:49.160> why<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.730> think<00:05:50.630> it

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
expansion I'm not sure why I think it

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.480 
expansion I'm not sure why I think it
would<00:05:51.110> be<00:05:51.140> in<00:05:51.410> his<00:05:51.560> best<00:05:51.590> interest<00:05:52.160> to<00:05:52.250> grab

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
would be in his best interest to grab

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.610 
would be in his best interest to grab
this<00:05:52.700> gold<00:05:53.120> because<00:05:53.960> of<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.170> fact<00:05:54.320> that<00:05:54.440> it's

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
this gold because of the fact that it's

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.930 
this gold because of the fact that it's
much<00:05:54.800> further<00:05:55.010> away<00:05:55.220> from<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.490> zurich<00:05:55.820> you'll

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
much further away from the zurich you'll

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.660 
much further away from the zurich you'll
be<00:05:56.030> able<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.210> defend<00:05:56.510> it<00:05:56.690> more<00:05:56.870> easily<00:05:57.140> i<00:05:57.350> think

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
be able to defend it more easily i think

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.430 
be able to defend it more easily i think
but<00:05:58.670> hey<00:05:59.240> it's<00:05:59.420> TL<00:05:59.690> oh<00:05:59.780> man<00:05:59.960> he<00:06:00.140> knows<00:06:00.290> what

but hey it's TL oh man he knows what

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.660 
but hey it's TL oh man he knows what
he's<00:06:00.560> doing<00:06:00.830> he's<00:06:00.980> throwing<00:06:01.220> up<00:06:01.280> another

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
command center is still kind of floating

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.640 
command center is still kind of floating
