00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
with this stuff why next to me not sure

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.309 
with this stuff why next to me not sure
if<00:02:34.700> you're<00:02:34.820> gonna<00:02:34.940> say

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
if you're gonna say

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.410 
if you're gonna say
there's<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.920> red<00:02:37.189> button<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.819> them<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.150> us

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
there's a red button all of them are us

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.010 
there's a red button all of them are us
to<00:02:38.920> basically<00:02:39.920> assess<00:02:40.519> doctor<00:02:40.819> enough

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
to basically assess doctor enough

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.620 
to basically assess doctor enough
we've<00:02:42.410> got<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.370> as<00:02:43.580> fast<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.210> possible

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
we've got get to as fast as possible

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.910 
we've got get to as fast as possible
with<00:02:44.750> fingers<00:02:45.050> you've<00:02:45.230> got<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> jump<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
with fingers you've got a jump on the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.090 
with fingers you've got a jump on the
bucket<00:02:46.400> that's<00:02:47.330> over<00:02:48.050> there<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.560> be<00:02:48.860> able<00:02:48.920> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
bucket that's over there to be able to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.020 
bucket that's over there to be able to
go<00:02:49.250> up<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.360> falls<00:02:50.660> down

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
go up there and that falls down

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
go up there and that falls down
basically<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.020> cool<00:02:53.350> down<00:02:53.860> start

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
basically you have to cool down start

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
basically you have to cool down start
again<00:02:54.460> let's<00:02:55.180> think<00:02:55.270> without<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.870> one

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
again let's think without the one

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.680 
again let's think without the one
see

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
see

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.699 
see
if<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.990> food<00:02:59.230> off<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.410> screen

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.760 

yeah<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.609> thought

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.980 

do<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.490> fast<00:03:07.730> about<00:03:07.970> us

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:23.090 

but<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.350> still

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.040
