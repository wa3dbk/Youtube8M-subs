00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.490

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.200
 washington hello sir they are like this and 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.900
 I want to ask you good the president 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.459
 from Syria Bashar al-Assad I who 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.460
 precisely today that the Middle East is a 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.010
 gunpowder the fire is approaching is 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.340
 really so critical this situation is 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.500
 so dark the stage 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 good afternoon, the last 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.190
 President Bashar's statements 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.100
 al-assad in his interview with the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.110
 French newspaper 'le figaro' are very 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.380
 important until we can say that 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.410
 They are the strongest since it began 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.770
 Syrian crisis we know that obama talked 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.170
 lately of a limited action one 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.320
 military action limited against Syria and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.900
 some experts said that the government 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.050
 Syrian might not respond in the case of 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.079
 perform this limited action but today 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.780
 President Asad confirmed that his 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.030
 country will respond to any kind of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.509
 intervention and not only this but said 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.130
 that an attack on Syria can be 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.470
 turn into a regional war 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.470
 this means that first the government 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.660
 Syrian made his decision to answer 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.710
 against any type of intervention 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.390
 although it is a limited action and second 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 mention the word regional war 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.150
 indicates that the borders 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.220
 respond to this attack may weigh the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.420
 Syrian borders and expand to others 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.690
 countries here we speak from lebanon 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.500
 there has also been information that usa and 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.770
 your allies 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.869
 they had the plan to attack damask in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.170
 same time there was a visit from 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.450
 high Iranian cargo and this if this is 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.720
 correct means that the attack against 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.960
 Syria has regional dimensions now 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.630
 We also see that the statements of 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.880
 the Iranian high officials when they threaten 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.399
 that the attack on Syria can be 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.220
 expand to a regional conflict this 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.800
 it means that the attack on Syria 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.840
 it is not just an attack against serious but 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.320
 it is an attack on Syria and its allies 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.810
 and can expand the whole region as 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.840
 we have said before then the scenario 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.459
 If it's very dark on one side we have the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.130
 terrorists that are functioning in 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.350
 Syria are massacring the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.060
 civilians and the Syrians we have the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.010
 petrodollars countries that are 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.120
 supporting these terrorists now 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.040
 we have usa 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.409
 what are they 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.760
 negotiating an attack against the government 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.040
 Syrian this means they are 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.319
 doing a favor are supporting the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.390
 terrorists and finally we have the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.760
 Syrian government to its allies who are 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.370
 preparations very well prepared for 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.319
 respond even if it comes to a conflict and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.659
 to a regional war 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.220
