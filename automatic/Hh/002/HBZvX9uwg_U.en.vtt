00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.610
 so we find the best equipped 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.610
 so we have our sensors of 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.690
 so only at his age 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.690
 I meant that we put behind the screen 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.470
 we are lucky because we have a superb plateau 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.939
 so we can say that it's because they have for him in college 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.150
 life for this purpose 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.289
 then the ol started it 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.289
 the placement of questions about the game 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.759
 but a little bit of 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.890
 a shine of his life 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.900
 so to do this 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 my age your structure 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.800
 wish notches 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 easier 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.000
 but here I am explained I am there by canberra the powers of 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.770
 characters and armor 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.450
 I'm at the club the best of the game 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 Why 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.420
 so man have chosen cards on the four who loves my 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.810
 possible opponent 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.210
 I know others 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.260
 six google teams starts after selection 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.120
 so mentally god 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.010
 he should not have done like that since the draw on the first 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.350
 players if they perform 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 after placing the pawns on the wave 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 a lot of flexibility that I know 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.610
 we could say that mom coming out in the trap that starts first 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.300
 2 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.460
 so I start to place 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 I go directly to the assets 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.930
 since I'm going plastic 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 the duo of severe secondary characters 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 U.S. too 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.689
 for me 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.709
 m 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 m 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 he too can explain that we can put the maximum 2 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.549
 on the 2 15 three years on that 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.599
 the other 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.779
 qliktech this type of vehicle 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.779
 or not 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.310
 it is neither three islands other sanction I think I'm explained 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.310
 Neither do I 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.799
 according to 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.269
 more than a click chosen to set no price 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.459
 what's going to happen 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.459
 that's why when you're very fluid 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.329
 on the contrary
