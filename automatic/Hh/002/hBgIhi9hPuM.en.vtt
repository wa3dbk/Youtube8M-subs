00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.040
 to make them you will need a chicken is better 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.010
 if you buy it already divided into parts of the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.630
 boutique vaio while for my stamp 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.699
 because my neck is big enough and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 this is a cancer spider a turn e 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.430
 half therefore for a potion like mine 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.340
 for a chicken, a half-holy rooster 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.899
 it takes three powers of the blonde with 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 mix smells bay sage rosemary 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 of pepper all extra virgin olive oil salt and a few 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.450
 clove of garlic 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.940
 now the first thing to do is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 support the ass divide into parts and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.539
 the cornering horse always born but 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 we come to the preparation that 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 very simple perfect now ours 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.449
 chicken is in pieces and washed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 as before we know it we know 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.799
 well all the parts now we take of the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.799
 pepper 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 let's see our paper we render the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.220
 bay leaves rosemary and I have 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.220
 already washed 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.680
 and then what we will do before 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.330
 put it in the pan lo flour remo 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.340
 slightly that before are me 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.350
 forgot to mention that it also serves a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 bit of flour 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.970
 now we will do it and then we see it 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.790
 very well that we are in a pan of 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.060
 have a little bit of oil 3 cloves 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 of garlic and then we take our pieces 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.300
 of chicken 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.940
 we simply pass on the flour and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.370
 we put them as our oil will start 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 sizzle this flour together with 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.980
 signature will form a creamy sauce at the end 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.150
 of the recipe that the best thing about 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.670
 this recipe was a creamy sauce with beer 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:33.000
 therefore the flour must be at a little 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.000
 generously we put our chicken 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 beautiful because the chicken and his 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:51.570
 Solar day for everyone crazy 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.670
 here it is calculated well on a high flame 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.190
 in this first part with the flame 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.970
 very high we add the first one 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.970
 bottle of beer 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.170
 add the last bottle of beer 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.550
 here is the level of the beer must 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.769
 almost entirely cover the chicken a 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.940
 at this point we lower the flame a 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.430
 very well after about an hour of 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.319
 cooking the beer is almost unexpected 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.030
 dried completely and left on 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:35.120
 a creamy sauce that is really delicious 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.150
 now let's brown ours well 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.160
 chicken pieces and in about ten minutes 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.960
 a quarter of their maximum is ready 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.280
 and here is the final result of 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.380
 our chicken with beer 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.250
 I hope you enjoyed this one too 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.250
