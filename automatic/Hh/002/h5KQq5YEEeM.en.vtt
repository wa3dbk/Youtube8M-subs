00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.530
 At a time resources are dwindling and growing environmental pollution 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.230
 More and more consumers are choosing new and intelligent 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.859
 energy concepts 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.499
 The conscious use of energy has long been synonymous with comfort and convenience 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.659
 Quality of life is a prime example of this 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.659
 do not heat injured 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.760
 Above all, it is the renewable energy wood that is the people 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.880
 convinced 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.250
 Internal tests insist on clean renewable energy for 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.240
 Independence from expensive and limited fossil fuels 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.350
 That is the reason 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 why more and more consumers on the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.230
 put compact bundle of energy 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 we have long after the heat with future 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.140
 searched and then decided on pellets and I think so 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.180
 that was the right decision 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.620
 Curiosity, the pellets he made from the native forest come from the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.680
 Raw material wood to the renewable domestic fuel 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.670
 That's almost unlimited for the future 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 which heats with wood as the co2 cycle of nature because the burning of wood 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.619
 releases as much carbon dioxide as the trees when growing the atmosphere 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 have withdrawn 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780
 heating with wood is therefore co2-neutral 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 and does not contribute to the global warming change to the greenhouse effect 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.410
 even demonstrably relieves our atmosphere 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.980
 the large wood stocks in Germany provide a good basis for the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.200
 further expansion of pellet production 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.329
 the raw material wood 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.609
 creates regional jobs and independence from the scarce 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.530
 fossil energy sources 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.109
 Fear and the supply of raw materials in the future 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.690
 also to have a bank 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.080
 what is scarcely known is the wood stocks in Germany's forests with 3com a 6 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 Billions of cubic meters higher than in other Central European countries 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 Scandinavia included 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 the farmer becomes Count BÃ¼low 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 is therefore safe 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.840
 whether Nielsen does not need Germany or even Central Europe 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.359
 Reason the principle of sustainability 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.000
 the flyer or Forsyth creates 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.300
 and there is no way more wood used than to change due to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.389
 partly or fully 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.899
 This is currently growing in the German forest 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.379
 As we actually use that, therefore, the consumer can be sure that in the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.369
 Forest does not hurt it is the opposite the case percent that's usually 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.959
 create a different look 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.589
 the asked and around 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.369
 the error range leads only to a higher value added in the 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.459
 This also fits sawmills in Bavarian forestry 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.889
 of course very well and 2 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.179
 comes from the rest 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.369
 to the fuel 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.899
 so you can describe the origin of the cases 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:51.029
 Chips or Uwe residues are the basis cost-effective co-products 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.709
 the saw or woodwork 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.170
 The raw materials almost always come from the region around the pellet production and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.129
 that means 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.469
 Short transport routes optimize the good environmental balance of injured 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.949
 the quality of the raw material plays a decisive role in the end product 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:08.609
 role 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.719
 only the best raw materials get hurt in certified ones 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.599
 and to ensure constant checks throughout the production process 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.219
 High quality products 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.619
 That recognizes the consumer's Ambient Plus certificate so excellent 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.989
 Pellets meet strict requirements of the European standard 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.449
 for pellet production, the wood residues are dried then crushed 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.669
 and finally get into the heart of the production in the Pelle press 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.469
 here is in a closed system under steam and we do 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.339
 process the recycled wood material 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.459
 pressed by a die arise from the raw material the typical wood 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.549
 in addition may 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.519
 the whole thing happens as shown here 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.519
 purely mechanical that is without chemical additives 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.819
 Police got to their knees and had 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.949
 the heat generated during the process and the remaining moisture in the wood are added 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.909
 as a nature the liver for the wood fibers holds together the result 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.230
 Pellets of pressed natural leftover wood 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.909
 a fuel with high energy density 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.669
 with its large wood supplies Miss Germany on top of the list 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:16.019
 skin 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.950
 production 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.500
 with 1 won 7 5 million tons were 2010 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.480
 no other European country 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 as many pellets produced as in Germany 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.870
 in addition to the customer too short because the elephant is regionally oriented too 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.669
 this strengthens the ecological balance of this fuel 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.520
 The dealer network for pellets is now guilty in Germany 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 Manko everywhere in Germany finds the right dealer 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.780
 Delivery is made with special fare vehicles the opposite 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.099
 reliable and above all 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.009
 favorable for the customers 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.940
 You can be sure that every manufacturer has to comply with requirements 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.629
 the one impeccable 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.559
 and energy-efficient heating 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.559
 since 2010 the norm throughout Europe 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.300
 and what the plus in such guarantees the customer too 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.030
 that traders who finally sell the cheapest meet the highest expectations 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.030
 be up to delivery to the customer 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:20.919
 nation 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.559
 environmentally friendly cole from the region 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.499
 a world the transport routes and he loses 1 4% to fuel oil and the 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.939
 Will save people 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.659
 heat with pellets 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.629
 far more than one hundred thousand households trust in Germany already on the 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:37.699
 small 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.370
 the energy is well tracked for the middle east 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.810
 the industry offers solutions for almost all requirements 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.110
 from the stove to the industrial plant 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.320
 for homeowners means heating with pellets sparingly contemporary 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.580
 Environmentally efficient and above all comfortable to operate 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.589
 For what changes 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.759
 from the handling of others 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.169
 it's all doomed to slander father need 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.599
 Nobody is worried about his second time 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.069
 some for once a year 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.030
 a little booked hotel nights in the children are always happy when they are through 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.569
 the night 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.219
 more is not it speaks Dr 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.529
 originally 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.770
 cozy 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.289
 whether stove or central heating 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.749
 Pellets should always be for pleasant warmth and spare thereby the purse and the 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:28.500
 Samples world 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.650
 An investment in the future 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.960
 heating with pellets means heating with a guaranteed feeling guaranteed 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.599
 Heating with pellets is easy 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.900
 comfortable and cheap 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.610
 very important that is our contribution to environmental protection
