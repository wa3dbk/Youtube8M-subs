00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.220
 while the competition is not in full 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.100
 here did that that we vibration 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.910
 urban the x bow for a carton on 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.350
 Internet 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
 they have also brought back to the taste of 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.559
 day the pogo stick your faith apply the 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.959
 jumping stick 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 everything lies at the fullest of this 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.810
 discipline which by the way is not so 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.820
 new as that since she was 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.820
 invented 100 years ago in germany 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.930
 then the jumping stick 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.560
 at first it's something very 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.030
 simple it's a boom and on this 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.340
 perch we put some footrests 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 we put a handlebar we put on it and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.210
 have historically made leaps the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.630
 propulsion is this realistic rather by 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.970
 then it was born at the beginning of 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.740
 20th century in Germany by two 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.230
 German and it's quickly gone then 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.460
 in the United States from the beginning of the twentieth 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 century in the 20s 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.020
 it was even broadway in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.500
 shows and so that has grown 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 very quickly 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 in 1999 we launched this famous braudel 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.490
 with a huge resort and that's it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 the ancestor of the pogo stick pogo stick 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.930
 freestyle is this big beast 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.520
 so it's a thing shape that makes that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.690
 it's hard to do the backflip with but 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690
 that's what we started 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 we also have another device that 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 propulsion so by spring for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.380
 allow younger people to realize 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.090
 their first figure the first is the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.500
 fun model 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 the fun model as I told you on 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 find the boom with the rest 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.070
 feet the handlebars inside we put 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.539
 four spring to absorb the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.810
 weights of people quite important 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.030
 from about 35 up to 60 kg and there we can 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530
 to do a lot of figure but that we will 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.420
 go higher we're going to be stronger 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.380
 we need to move on 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.860
 and then with that we move on to the project and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.880
 the pro am here it is a device that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.599
 swells 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.590
 so he walks with air pressure 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.260
 who inflate themselves with a pump all 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.540
 simple here and we can adjust so his 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 pressure according to its weight and then according 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.340
 his performance and with that we can climb 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.940
 up to 12 meters from which we can make 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.940
 figures of phew 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.310
 or at usa x bow wow it's a group of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.129
 friends who grew up and who has 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.980
 started from the pogo stick 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.510
 with different types of propulsion they 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 make great faces means 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.739
 now it's really top of the top 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.989
 it's stopping the world's best 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.360
 they constituted they invented 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.980
 tricks and europe 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.280
 dimitri is probably the best 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.730
 European also develops his tricks 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.579
 work with that and mitry at 16 he 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.000
 makes 60 kg and already it is written sending 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.920
 huge 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.940
 so we really think it's going to be a 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.940
 big in not long 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.370
 actually with the with the tai chi to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.120
 8 must acquire or to see which 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.390
 several qualities 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.860
 the first is the balance 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.320
 have to hold physically because that's 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.540
 demanding in demanding cardios 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.730
 muscularly room the stool and also 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.030
 a bit and then you have to know displaced 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.080
 in three dimensions so the tk goals on 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.580
 in fact as we want but when we 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.040
 starts doing it really freestyle 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.460
 we reach the level of mitri 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.170
 close it means we go up 1,82 m on 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.150
 wall jumps that are three meters 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.070
 steira we start typing fronds 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.320
 fli of backflips to think of his 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.250
 security his body is sacred it is necessary 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.410
 think about his safety 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.820
 so the first thing is obviously 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.670
 we recommend all the time 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.850
 commands to put a helmet a helmet 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.990
 norms to the normans n to have everything 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.730
 the time of shoes with 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.520
 thick soles so the soles of 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.540
 skate or bmx and canonissime it goes great 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.510
 good with 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 and then eventually put if you want 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.420
 elbows protections knee yesterday 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.370
 yesterday but especially the two most 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.700
 important is the headphones and the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.700
 shoes 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.150
 so we're just starting to go to 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.570
 launch this sport in France but even in 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.010
 Europe 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.320
 we even start developing it a 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.900
 little bit also in Japan now he 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.570
 we need to have people of good level 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.190
 who starts doing it already we're going 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.710
 so launch some of the first 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.370
 championships of small competitions 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.650
 with the fun model 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.090
 what more accessible you already you 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.740
 can resume figures and 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.900
 tricks that you do that on the scooter 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.310
 either on the skateboard also you can gr.b 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.210
 to do 360 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.430
 and then down to get small to 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.890
 small at the level of dmitri started to 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.020
 to link the bat li playfrance flip etc 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.820
 people have to start at it 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.580
 must jumpers start to access 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.270
 so a certain level and we think that 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.220
 all who already are in the bmx 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.410
 so that means we're not too scared 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.600
 all those same who is starting to send 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.930
 in scooter can start to get 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.800
 realize and do heavy stuff years 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.800
 with the with the tec at 8 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
 this
