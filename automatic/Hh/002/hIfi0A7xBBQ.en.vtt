00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
at by an Valdez clinic I like to

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.030 
at by an Valdez clinic I like to
introduce<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:22.300> new<00:00:22.630> technology<00:00:23.500> it's<00:00:23.770> called

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
introduce a new technology it's called

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.480 
introduce a new technology it's called
by<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.279> pulsar<00:00:24.820> it's<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.660> German<00:00:26.200> device<00:00:26.650> where<00:00:27.460> a

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
by a pulsar it's a German device where a

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.970 
by a pulsar it's a German device where a
client<00:00:27.670> can<00:00:28.630> can<00:00:29.199> place<00:00:29.560> his<00:00:30.520> or<00:00:30.820> her<00:00:31.060> hand<00:00:31.480> on

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
client can can place his or her hand on

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.340 
client can can place his or her hand on
this<00:00:32.980> device<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.510> points<00:00:34.989> on<00:00:35.140> this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
this device and the points on this

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.890 
this device and the points on this
device<00:00:35.770> will<00:00:36.190> give<00:00:36.670> us<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:37.090> reading<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:38.140> a

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
device will give us a reading of a

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.540 
device will give us a reading of a
pulsation<00:00:40.900> from<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.559> hand<00:00:41.830> which<00:00:42.129> will<00:00:42.400> be

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
pulsation from the hand which will be

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.829 
pulsation from the hand which will be
then<00:00:43.140> translated<00:00:44.140> into<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:45.220> color<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.629> this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
then translated into the color so this

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.820 
then translated into the color so this
wavelength<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.769> is<00:00:48.040> now<00:00:48.430> showing<00:00:48.909> us<00:00:49.330> on<00:00:49.830> the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
wavelength is is now showing us on the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.869 
wavelength is is now showing us on the
screen<00:00:51.220> as<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.549> color<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.360> februari<00:00:53.260> 25th<00:00:53.979> we

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
screen as the color on februari 25th we

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.320 
screen as the color on februari 25th we
took<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.390> reading<00:00:55.900> here<00:00:56.409> for<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> client<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:58.120> took

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
took a reading here for a client we took

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.200 
took a reading here for a client we took
the<00:00:58.540> first<00:00:58.930> reading<00:00:59.290> called<00:00:59.890> a<00:01:00.010> baseline<00:01:00.790> and

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
the first reading called a baseline and

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.140 
the first reading called a baseline and
then<00:01:02.019> after<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:02.799> client<00:01:03.250> use<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.699> mised

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
then after this client use a mised

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.410 
then after this client use a mised
fusion<00:01:04.989> technology<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:06.430> took<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:07.000> reading

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
fusion technology we took the reading

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.160 
fusion technology we took the reading
one<00:01:07.630> more<00:01:07.869> time<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.369> can<00:01:09.850> observe<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
one more time then you can observe the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.990 
one more time then you can observe the
difference<00:01:11.799> in<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:13.440> change<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.460> energy

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
difference in the change of the energy

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.959 
difference in the change of the energy
of<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.479> person<00:01:17.140> yes<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.460> can<00:01:18.640> open<00:01:18.909> your

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
of this person yes and you can open your

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.930 
of this person yes and you can open your
eyes<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.680> basically<00:01:20.979> have<00:01:21.549> you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.850 

your<00:01:25.090> picture<00:01:25.540> establish<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.410> over<00:01:26.710> there

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
your picture establish here over there

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.120 
your picture establish here over there
so<00:01:27.760> this<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.150> what<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.510> admitting<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.650> at

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
so this is what you admitting that is at

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.640 
so this is what you admitting that is at
this<00:01:30.370> time<00:01:30.640> Oh<00:01:31.000> water<00:01:31.480> energy<00:01:31.810> your<00:01:32.230> body<00:01:32.260> is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
this time Oh water energy your body is

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.810 
this time Oh water energy your body is
emitting<00:01:33.280> yeah<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:33.940> what<00:01:34.360> we<00:01:34.510> wanted<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> see

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
emitting yeah so what we wanted to see

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.190 
emitting yeah so what we wanted to see
after<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:37.180> are<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.570> take<00:01:37.720> this<00:01:37.930> picture

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
after we are going to take this picture

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.110 
after we are going to take this picture
one<00:01:38.500> more<00:01:38.530> time<00:01:38.980> after<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.610> being<00:01:39.910> treated

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
one more time after you being treated

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:55.530 
one more time after you being treated
with<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.750> device<00:01:41.310> okay

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:05.130 

we<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.880> be<00:02:04.030> looking<00:02:04.180> for<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.630> don't<00:02:04.930> want

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
we would be looking for I don't want

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.270 
we would be looking for I don't want
those<00:02:05.560> colors<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.160> change<00:02:06.430> anymore<00:02:06.790> yes

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
those colors to change anymore yes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.980 
those colors to change anymore yes
you're<00:02:09.280> going<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.550> see<00:02:09.910> all<00:02:10.300> these<00:02:10.600> potential

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
you're going to see all these potential

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.240 
you're going to see all these potential
for<00:02:11.230> better<00:02:11.500> yes<00:02:12.280> yes<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.570> I'll<00:02:13.690> explain<00:02:14.050> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
for better yes yes and I'll explain that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.290 
for better yes yes and I'll explain that
look<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> huge<00:02:16.090> chance<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.840> actually<00:02:16.960> Oh

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
look at the huge chance to actually Oh

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.990 
look at the huge chance to actually Oh
together<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.920> remember<00:02:20.920> when<00:02:21.340> i<00:02:21.460> said<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
together and remember when i said the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.930 
together and remember when i said the
green<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.720> most<00:02:23.440> optimal<00:02:24.070> color<00:02:24.400> yeah

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
green is the most optimal color yeah

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.510 
green is the most optimal color yeah
that's<00:02:25.330> when<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.990> would<00:02:26.170> talk<00:02:26.500> about<00:02:26.860> an<00:02:27.070> ideal

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
that's when we would talk about an ideal

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.000 
that's when we would talk about an ideal
now<00:02:28.360> we've<00:02:28.630> seen<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.959> little<00:02:29.200> bit<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.770> green

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
now we've seen a little bit of the green

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
now we've seen a little bit of the green
underneath<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:30.820> we<00:02:31.000> now<00:02:31.240> see<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.780> green<00:02:32.020> all

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
underneath but we now see the green all

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.390 
underneath but we now see the green all
over<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:33.100> from<00:02:33.550> external<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:36.250> get

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
over you from external you really get

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.880 
over you from external you really get
much<00:02:36.610> more<00:02:36.880> piece<00:02:37.240> here<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.990> when<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:38.500> look

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
much more piece here so when we look

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.660 
much more piece here so when we look
here<00:02:39.430> look<00:02:40.330> at<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.870> spectrum<00:02:41.470> yeah<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.220> red

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
here look at this spectrum yeah the red

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.940 
here look at this spectrum yeah the red
is<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.300> first<00:02:43.540> energy<00:02:43.990> that's<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.709> first

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
is the first energy that's the first

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.880 
is the first energy that's the first
chakra<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:45.700> where<00:02:45.970> everything<00:02:46.660> starts<00:02:47.260> so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
chakra that's where everything starts so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.479 
chakra that's where everything starts so
we<00:02:48.430> kickin<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.420> red<00:02:49.690> color<00:02:49.989> right<00:02:50.380> here

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
we kickin some red color right here

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.400 
we kickin some red color right here
whenever<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.820> needed<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.660> know<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.900> was<00:02:53.110> gray

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
whenever it needed you know it was gray

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.160 
whenever it needed you know it was gray
there<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.400> means<00:02:54.670> your<00:02:54.850> body<00:02:55.030> didn't<00:02:55.840> react

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
there that means your body didn't react

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.320 
there that means your body didn't react
with<00:02:56.410> some-something<00:02:56.760> chronic<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.090> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
body is not addressing that's why it's

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.020 
body is not addressing that's why it's
no<00:03:01.090> colored<00:03:01.540> area<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.380> gray<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.700> after

no colored area it's the gray but after

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.560 
no colored area it's the gray but after
the<00:03:04.600> treatment<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.950> kicked<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.970> this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
the treatment you kicked in this this

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.740 
the treatment you kicked in this this
this<00:03:07.900> energy<00:03:08.440> rider<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.970> really<00:03:10.180> put

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
this energy rider but you really put

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.259 
this energy rider but you really put
that<00:03:11.049> in<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.549> know<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.880> have<00:03:13.060> some

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
that in and you know we have some

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.509 
that in and you know we have some
magenta<00:03:13.840> coming<00:03:14.230> through<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:14.769> them<00:03:15.040> it's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
magenta coming through with them it's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.500 
magenta coming through with them it's
the<00:03:15.850> highest<00:03:16.060> vibrancy<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:18.239> very<00:03:19.239> nice

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
the highest vibrancy of that very nice

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.180 
the highest vibrancy of that very nice
difference<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.620> look<00:03:20.860> at<00:03:21.040> this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
difference but if you look at this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.130 
difference but if you look at this
picture<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.940> actually<00:03:22.510> know<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
picture you actually know this is the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.650 
picture you actually know this is the
same<00:03:23.350> person<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:24.750> definite<00:03:25.750> improvement<00:03:26.500> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
same person a definite improvement in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.650 
same person a definite improvement in
immediate<00:03:28.660> definite<00:03:29.110> improvement<00:03:30.040> in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
immediate definite improvement in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.479 
immediate definite improvement in
overall<00:03:33.780> how<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.080> put<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.290> lucky<00:03:35.620> your

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
overall how can I put it lucky your

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.210 
overall how can I put it lucky your
energy<00:03:37.030> changed<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.530> me<00:03:38.650> energy<00:03:39.160> is

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
energy changed and to me energy is

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.430 
energy changed and to me energy is
everything
