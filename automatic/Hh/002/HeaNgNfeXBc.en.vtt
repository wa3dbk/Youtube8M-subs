was the only way to transmit or share
this<00:01:52.740> information<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> Natural<00:01:54.270> History

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
this information so a Natural History

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.140 
this information so a Natural History
illustration<00:01:55.230> would<00:01:55.800> enable<00:01:56.070> someone<00:01:56.700> who
