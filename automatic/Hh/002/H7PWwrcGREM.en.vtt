00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
why because aluminum and steel when they

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
why because aluminum and steel when they
get<00:00:31.199> together<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.189> stay<00:00:32.399> together<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

something you can put on the hub to keep

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.129 
something you can put on the hub to keep
the<00:04:56.800> wheel<00:04:56.950> from<00:04:57.220> sticking<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.729> it<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.139> suppose

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
the wheel from sticking to it I suppose

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.719 
the wheel from sticking to it I suppose
you<00:04:59.380> could<00:04:59.560> use<00:04:59.590> some<00:04:59.830> anti-seize<00:05:00.280> or<00:05:00.580> maybe

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
you could use some anti-seize or maybe

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.360 
you could use some anti-seize or maybe
some<00:05:00.910> axle<00:05:01.240> grease<00:05:01.419> or<00:05:01.630> something<00:05:01.900> like<00:05:01.990> that

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
some axle grease or something like that

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.740 
some axle grease or something like that
to<00:05:03.370> be<00:05:03.490> honest<00:05:03.760> though<00:05:03.940> is<00:05:04.150> that<00:05:04.360> really<00:05:04.630> going

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
to be honest though is that really going

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.870 
to be honest though is that really going
to<00:05:04.810> work<00:05:04.960> maybe<00:05:05.830> for<00:05:06.100> a<00:05:06.130> little<00:05:06.310> while<00:05:06.460> most

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
to work maybe for a little while most

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.010 
to work maybe for a little while most
likely<00:05:07.180> it's<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:07.419> going<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.570> make<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.750> mess

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
likely it's just going to make a mess

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.640 
likely it's just going to make a mess
