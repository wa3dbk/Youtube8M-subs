00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 professional bleaching procedure 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.000
 teeth are dental and become 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.160
 familiar to our patients 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 about this technology and also generally 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.120
 whom now his tongues will not talk with 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.759
 our doctor dentist Melnikov and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 my alexander in two words need 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.470
 explain what teeth whitening is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.930
 and also what type of filing is most 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 effectively teeth whitening 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.810
 this is a reaction removing accumulated 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.170
 tooth tooth stain 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.329
 at the moment there is 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 a huge number of bleaching techniques 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.390
 teeth this laser photo and just 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 chemical methods it is individually 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.789
 does your doctor pick it up yourself 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.280
 whiten teeth grin whitening 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.129
 pure aesthetic procedure and to it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.340
 there is no medical indication if 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.590
 mouth there are some diseases that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.559
 Of course, first of all you need 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 sanitize the mouth 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.250
 does strips for home help 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 bleaching 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.979
 some effect can give you but 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 preferably whitening procedure 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.340
 supervised by a dentist is still such 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.700
 question is it possible 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.109
 I could get a life just like that 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 probability exists 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:27.259
 if you use homemade whitening 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.409
 with professional disc whitening 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.479
 carefully insulated and when 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.030
 professional battle is not on painful 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.810
 I'll take from every person 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.329
 individual pain threshold 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.369
 additional local anesthesia 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:47.689
 whitening procedure is not required therefore 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.119
 the answer is no not a disease but if some 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.649
 nuances and features when bleaching 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.840
 teeth whitening new and after of course 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.800
 and during and after bleaching need 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.790
 take into account the phenomenon 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.340
 together and a white diet that is necessary 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.710
 comply remarkably professional 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.510
 brushing teeth and whitening is one thing 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.860
 if not to explain in simple language 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.130
 professional hygiene is aimed at 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.880
 removal of plaque and plaque 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 that is, it cleans the surface of the tooth that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.190
 for whitening then this 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.780
 directly removing the dyes from 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.970
 tissues of the tooth itself 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.090
 now a few words on brushing your teeth 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.280

 need to brush your teeth twice a day but 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.520
 question cop individual associations 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.710
 cleaning the teeth house is decided and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.180
 adjust and directly your 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.260
 doctors dentists 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.070
 but you need to clean while reading language 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 language is quite an important point when 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.790
 individual oral hygiene 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.230
 because it accumulates large 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.180
 the number of bacteria is wonderful 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.599
 how effective is the application 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.709
 Easter of course toothpastes
