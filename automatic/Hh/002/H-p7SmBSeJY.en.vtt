now at like another 8x go on top of that
so<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.020> crazy<00:01:23.030> what<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.390> prediction

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
so it's crazy what are you my prediction
for<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.500> won't<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
for this is that it won't be just for

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
for this is that it won't be just for
the<00:01:26.430> l<00:01:26.549> 96<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.240> shows<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.810> only<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the l 96 it shows that it's only for the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.069 
the l 96 it shows that it's only for the
l<00:01:28.380> 96<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.130> mean<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.939> doesn't<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.840> little

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
l 96 I mean it doesn't the little

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
l 96 I mean it doesn't the little
picture<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.500> show<00:01:31.680> any<00:01:32.280> other<00:01:32.670> gun

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
picture doesn't show any other gun

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
picture doesn't show any other gun
having<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.479> anything<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> one

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
having it or anything it's just that one

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
having it or anything it's just that one
gun<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> stuff<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
gun and stuff like that but I think it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
gun and stuff like that but I think it
should<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.400> weapons<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> mean

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
should will be for more weapons I mean

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.950 
should will be for more weapons I mean
to<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.270> give<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> m<00:01:39.750> 98<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.720> 20x<00:01:42.720> scope

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to not give the m 98 be the 20x scope

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
to not give the m 98 be the 20x scope
would<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.259> stupid<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.220> come<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
would be stupid I mean come on that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.620 
would be stupid I mean come on that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
they have this 20x scope is due to the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
they have this 20x scope is due to the
fact<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.149> armored<00:02:06.479> kill<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.899> huge

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
fact that armored kill so huge

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
fact that armored kill so huge
yeah<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.619> some<00:02:11.870> 1900<00:02:12.870> by

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
yeah yeah it is like some 1900 by

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.040 
yeah yeah it is like some 1900 by
something<00:02:13.650> outside<00:02:13.860> sup<00:02:14.760> from<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.240> don't<00:02:15.960> even

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
something outside sup from I don't even

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
something outside sup from I don't even
remember<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> while<00:02:18.030> ago

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
remember but it was it was a while ago

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
remember but it was it was a while ago
the<00:02:18.450> details<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.320> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.710> forgot<00:02:19.950> didn't

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the details so I kind of forgot didn't

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 
the details so I kind of forgot didn't
write<00:02:20.520> them<00:02:20.580> down<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:20.970> anything<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.420> yeah<00:02:22.020> but

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
write them down or anything so yeah but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.730 
write them down or anything so yeah but
uh<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> my<00:02:24.420> prediction<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.350> won't<00:02:25.470> be

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
uh so my prediction is that it won't be

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.500 
uh so my prediction is that it won't be
only<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> l<00:02:26.340> 96<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.180> that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
only for the l 96 and if it is that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.330 
only for the l 96 and if it is that's
kind<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.930> gonna<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:29.010> bit<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.280> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
kind of be gonna be a little bit of a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
kind of be gonna be a little bit of a
bummer<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.730> me<00:02:29.790> personally<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.600> uh<00:02:30.660> it's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
bummer for me personally but uh it's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.630 
bummer for me personally but uh it's
nothing<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.740> can't<00:02:31.980> deal<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.370> mean

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640

you just have to you're gonna really

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
you just have to you're gonna really
have<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.860> account<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.460> um<00:02:37.850> bullet<00:02:38.850> drop

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
have to account for um bullet drop

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.790 
have to account for um bullet drop
especially<00:02:39.480> over<00:02:39.660> those<00:02:39.780> crazy-ass<00:02:40.530> long

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
especially over those crazy-ass long

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
could be a good thing maybe you'll get

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.380 
could be a good thing maybe you'll get
your<00:03:25.560> weapon<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.190> last<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.930> last<00:03:27.989> kill

your weapon for that last that last kill

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.640 
your weapon for that last that last kill
well<00:03:30.390> now<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.630> didn't<00:03:31.019> read<00:03:31.140> anything<00:03:31.410> about

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
well now I didn't read anything about

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.890 
well now I didn't read anything about
them<00:03:31.890> keeping<00:03:32.310> like<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> knife<00:03:33.330> as<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> last

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
them keeping like the knife as the last

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.810 
them keeping like the knife as the last
kill<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:34.290> I'm<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.980> expecting<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.610> maybe

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
kill so I'm just expecting that maybe

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.539 
kill so I'm just expecting that maybe
they'll<00:03:36.000> change<00:03:36.150> up<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.420> last<00:03:37.160> weapon<00:03:38.160> that

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
they'll change up the last weapon that

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.759 
they'll change up the last weapon that
you<00:03:38.670> need<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.910> use<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.330> last<00:03:39.450> kill

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
you need to use to get the last kill

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.590 
you need to use to get the last kill
hopefully<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.040> said<00:03:41.820> kill<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.120> three<00:03:42.360> times

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
hopefully I said kill like three times

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.050 
hopefully I said kill like three times
it<00:03:43.320> flipped<00:03:43.739> arms<00:03:44.040> right<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.959> well<00:03:46.790> yeah<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
it flipped arms right there well yeah so

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.000 
it flipped arms right there well yeah so
uh<00:03:48.140> what<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.260> think<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.769> think<00:03:49.920> it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
uh what do I think about it I think it's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.800 
uh what do I think about it I think it's
good<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.310> think<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.790> needs<00:03:51.030> some<00:03:51.209> new<00:03:51.330> Mac

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
good I think it needs some new Mac

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.320 
good I think it needs some new Mac
rotations<00:03:52.380> well<00:03:53.370> weapon<00:03:53.820> rotations
