Titan warlock and hunter now these
subclasses<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.380> make<00:00:22.619> sense<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
subclasses do make sense they are the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
subclasses do make sense they are the
element<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:24.810> missing<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.439> example<00:00:25.830> Titan

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
element that's missing for example Titan

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.210 
element that's missing for example Titan
striker<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.970> arc<00:00:27.599> Titan<00:00:28.230> defender<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.890> void

striker is arc Titan defender is void
and<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.150> new<00:00:30.330> leaked<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.250> solar<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and the the new leaked one is solar so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
and the the new leaked one is solar so
the<00:00:32.969> only<00:00:33.149> leaked<00:00:33.510> information<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> new

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the only leaked information was the new

grenades<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.800> each<00:00:38.010> class<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.149> let's<00:00:39.360> get

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
grenades for each class so let's get

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.400 
grenades for each class so let's get
right<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
right into it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
right into it
firstly<00:00:41.070> Titan<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.329> new<00:00:42.480> subclass<00:00:42.960> called

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
firstly Titan the new subclass called

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
firstly Titan the new subclass called
Chris<00:00:43.860> sader<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.820> super<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> called<00:00:45.870> purge

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
Chris sader the super is called purge

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.819 
Chris sader the super is called purge
you<00:00:47.039> shoot<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.520> giant<00:00:48.210> horizontal<00:00:49.140> cylinder

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you shoot a giant horizontal cylinder

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
you shoot a giant horizontal cylinder
basically<00:00:50.660> directly<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.870> front<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> now

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
basically directly in front of you now

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
basically directly in front of you now
you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.460> upgrade<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.030> cylinder<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you can upgrade this cylinder to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
you can upgrade this cylinder to
increase<00:00:55.230> its<00:00:55.469> thickness<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> 200%

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
increase its thickness about a 200%

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
increase its thickness about a 200%
increase<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.079> also<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> column

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
increase you can also have a column

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
increase you can also have a column
shoot<00:00:59.550> behind<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.329> basically<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.960> think

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
shoot behind you so basically just think

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.100 
shoot behind you so basically just think
of<00:01:01.430> how<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.850> basically<00:01:03.030> directly<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of how you can basically directly in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
of how you can basically directly in
front<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.559> shooting<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> giant<00:01:05.519> beam<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
front of you shooting a giant beam of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
front of you shooting a giant beam of
light<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.960> will<00:01:07.200> kill<00:01:07.590> guys<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.159> probably

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
light that will kill guys and probably

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.670 
light that will kill guys and probably
do<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> shit<00:01:09.150> ton<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> damage<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.439> are

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
do a shit ton of damage if they are

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
do a shit ton of damage if they are
within<00:01:11.220> its<00:01:11.700> area<00:01:12.470> now<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
within its area now going over the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
within its area now going over the
grenades<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.790> first<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.330> throws<00:01:15.630> three

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
grenades the first one throws three

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.609 
grenades the first one throws three
small<00:01:16.830> fire<00:01:17.340> grenades<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:18.060> once<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
small fire grenades at once think of a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.820 
small fire grenades at once think of a
very<00:01:19.830> small<00:01:20.220> version<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.630> Warlock<00:01:22.439> void

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
very small version of the Warlock void

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.429 
very small version of the Warlock void
special<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.909> again<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.869> goes<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
special and again this goes with the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.620 
special and again this goes with the
theme<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.220> missing<00:01:26.729> class<00:01:26.970> being<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
theme of the missing class being the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.179
