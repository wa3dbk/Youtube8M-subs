 they will be saying good as you see 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.740
 the architecture of various things of the epp 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.140
 software is different from what was the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.320
 xbox 360 that is to say they are already nine years 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.760
 of technology difference and good this 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.740
 adapter serves for all those who 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.820

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.100
 be turtle wheaton astro whatever 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.410
 these this serves for what is the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.809
 microphone very well not for not of the audio 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
 of game but for the audio of your voice 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.640
 this is used to control so much what 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.829
 what is the volume so you can be 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.940
 already totally your hearing aids and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.910
 you just have to use this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.219
 adapter very well here as they see the left 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.250
 the price I bought it in game planet and 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.530
 I say it because it sponsors me xd xd not what 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.559
 I say because I went to several stores already 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.350
 all that I went they gave it to 50 pesos 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.080
 more expensive here the price is 400 and already 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.320
 you know I do not know 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.220
 very good very well 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.690
 very well let's see what is the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.510
 packaging is very nice this here 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.240
 how can you grab it to burn because they are 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.650
 I'm going to see here the part of a side 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.400

 here it tells us that a 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 update for control and that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.870

 to put the adapter here 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.280

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.330
 manuals that we never read unless 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.430
 let's have a problem it's always the same 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.980

 we can connect them is fine and what 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.170
 functions each one is very nice to me 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.470
 like the green 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.020
 It makes me very nice, very young 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.490
 more information about the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.500
 control update that already 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.110
 I had done and a video but not necessary 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.530
 other videos 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.750
 and what's in the copyright manual 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.210
 of the guarantee was ar - totally 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.900
 save this if I'm not going to activate it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.900
 I going to keep it 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.569
 and then basically that we will do 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.939
 for something else 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.640
 I am very sorry and good, here I am going to 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.610
 go on to teach what all this is 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.340
 here as you see increase in gm to see if 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.930
 focuses well and webcams this symbolic of 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.360
 here from the ex oxman's control is for 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.770
 increase the volume of the game be here 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.250
 down people to increase the 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.290
 volume of the players and here is the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.330
 volume in general increase up 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.730
 or down this in means to 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.790
 mute your microphone this left the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.400
 from shenzhen 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.640
 it connects exactly the same as the control 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.580
 of football and as you see is very divided 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.040
 and it feels does not weigh much 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.040
 let me take it off without breaking anything clear 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.620
 and let's see what the cables that bring 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 included let's open it 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.010
 and we like to also like 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.400
 video to keep bringing you more 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.550
 boxing about useful things things things 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.390
 pretty cool and living 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.920
 ok let's open it to the bad this guy 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.920
 do not want to leave here is 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.460
 this is the auxiliary adapter the truth 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.210
 disappoints me I expected it to be one 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.850
 chad gold plated gold but because 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.220
 well you can ask us everything then 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:13.420
 this you connect here as you can see 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.150
 ready and this goes to your ex sets very 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.710
 good good gang I'm going to do 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.510
 a video of how to install all this 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.330
 chaos but that's going to be in 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.160
 approximately 10 days since as 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.420
 many will know on my facebook and twitter 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.010
 but others do not this one of my dogs 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.110
 unfortunately morros bit bit 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.970
 the power source of my current ex and it 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.520
 broke the cable fortunately is 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.350
 well more electrocuted the dog and macro 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.690
 they are very fortunately behaved very 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.790
 good wave and they will send me a new one 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.350
 with the guarantee but in approximately 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.410
 10 days they will give me and I went to 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.640
 deliver them today by parcel of mine 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.740
 so good when I have everything 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.780
 ready I'm going to bring a tutorial 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.000
 complete so they can install it already 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.890
 that these super necessary and basic for 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.430
 everyone who has headsets does not matter 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.510
 mark this is basic to dry well 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.870
 that a gang I hope there has been 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.400
 liked the video and well this is 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.630
 this 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.810
 I did not forget a cable if I good 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.750
 Well, let's see what this is, this is 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.389
 basically a great cable one look 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.669
 which also includes a mini usb cable 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.590
 I wanted micro usb in case you do not have one 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.000
 to update the control and also if 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.710
 you want to give it a wire shape but 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.930
 he's too young to see let's see the 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.930
 size let's see 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.270
 if it is definitely nothing more for 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.340
 install the control update 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.600
 because it is so small so now 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.860
 gang up here I'll leave the video 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.130
 I hope you liked either a 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.980
 boxing of the hearing aid adapter 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.900
 stereo for the former software the city I 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.240
 like to comment anywhere and we 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.690
 we see syndication think a lot that I 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.690
 changed life
