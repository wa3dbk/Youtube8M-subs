00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 we arrive in a season where is this 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.279
 we want to make big money 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 young people and especially the weekend and a block 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.370
 is typically Quebec something 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.540
 I love since I'm all 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 small and that I love in Corsica and the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 cretons but on the other hand shocked 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.849
 cretons that are found on the market are 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 not always good and are also complained 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.359
 additives when we read the list of 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.340
 ingredients that scares me so I 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.980
 found a grandmother recipe from 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.310
 house cretons that can be done at home 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 are delicious and so much so I 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 tell you the list of ingredients 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.349
 it's minced pork I mixed 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.899
 three quarters of pork and a body of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.059
 turkey for it to be a little lighter a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.079
 little less fat and it's a book here that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.789
 we have 5 250 grams a case of crumb 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 of bread a white onion rap and a cup 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.530
 of milk by the swords are our 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 nutmeg a quarter of q games let's keep 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 cinnamon into quarters 2 tablespoons 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.170
 tea too we will put an 8th 2 spoons 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.090
 cloves and we're going 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.250
 put a grass that I love especially in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 winter the sage the sage that is to be 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 managed the bleachers that it gives a taste 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 as fabulous or creton deliver well 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.270
 sure salt and pepper 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.619
 then you will see success is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.320
 not complicated we will put everything in a 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.450
 cauldron and we'll let it cook 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 slowly for an hour on a low heat 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.280
 we start by putting the meat but 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.390
 you will see o'neal bold 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.729
 eburnie the oil in our cauldron 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 because the port is pretty big like 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.250
 it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 then we add our big price onions 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.480
 we add the spices starting with 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 the musical 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.990
 cinnamon the hardest and sage 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.010
 mix well during a greenhouse 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:46.960
 good amount of weight our mii 's 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.120
 bread and our at the mix just right that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 it's homogeneous and we let it cook 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.060
 gentle fire for one hour 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.590
 1e so an hour later not 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.000
 complicated we put that in molds and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.440
 put you in the fridge all night so 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.790
 it's good to do the night before 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.740
 otherwise it can be a few hours at 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.390
 fridge ch as long as it's frozen like 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.870
 cretons and here is the presentation 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.090
 suggest you unmold it and in a 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.860
 plate with knives or roasts 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 small cucumbers pieces of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.970
 tomatoes you introduce it to your guests or 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.190
 to your farmer with this ministry a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.440
 side it can be kept four days 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.330
 maximum in the fridge but I guarantee you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 that when you're going to put on the head 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.940
 it should go quickly enough otherwise you 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.130
 can put it in smaller ones 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 ramekins and freeze them and take them out 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.440
 on occasion then a recipe that makes 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 about two containers like that orh there 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.560
