about<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.820> Twitter<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.690> why<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.170> call

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
about this on Twitter but why not call

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it the iWatch kind of makes me think

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
it the iWatch kind of makes me think
that<00:00:42.989> Apple<00:00:43.140> might<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:44.250> leaning<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that Apple might be actually leaning to

calling<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> iPhone<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> Apple<00:00:46.920> phone

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
calling the iPhone just the Apple phone

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.209 
calling the iPhone just the Apple phone
I<00:00:47.399> mean<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.539> stretch<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
I mean that's a stretch right but for

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
I mean that's a stretch right but for
the<00:00:50.340> sake<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.789> sanity<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.449> might<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.989> call

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the sake of my sanity I might just call

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
the sake of my sanity I might just call
it<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> i<00:00:52.379> watch<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.890> few<00:00:53.070> times<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.670> video

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it the i watch a few times in this video

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
it the i watch a few times in this video
so<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> watch<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.500> turned<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
