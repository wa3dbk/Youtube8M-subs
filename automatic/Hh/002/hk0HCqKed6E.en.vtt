00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.500 
the mirror right in front of me this
side<00:02:43.360> looks<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:45.790> smooth<00:02:46.209> out

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
side looks like it's more smooth out

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.589 
side looks like it's more smooth out
then<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.489> appearance<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.390> more

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
then the the appearance of it is more

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.900 
then the the appearance of it is more
smoothed<00:02:50.019> out<00:02:50.230> rather<00:02:50.470> than<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.950> Smashbox

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
smoothed out rather than the Smashbox

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.610 
smoothed out rather than the Smashbox
one<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.680> looks<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.480> laurio<00:02:56.049> almost

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
one so it looks like the laurio almost

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.059 
one so it looks like the laurio almost
has<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:57.129> little<00:02:57.519> bit<00:02:58.299> more<00:02:58.569> coverage<00:02:59.170> almost

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
has a little bit more coverage almost

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.119 
has a little bit more coverage almost
and<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:01.060> kind<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.420> evens<00:03:01.780> out<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.410> skin<00:03:02.590> tone<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
and it kind of evens out the skin tone a

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.640 
and it kind of evens out the skin tone a
little<00:03:03.250> bit<00:03:03.670> more<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.930> having<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.440> good

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
cheaper and if I smile and comparing

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.229 
cheaper and if I smile and comparing
around<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.480> eyes<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.410> fine<00:03:39.370> lines<00:03:39.760> around

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
around the eyes the fine lines around

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.809 
around the eyes the fine lines around
the<00:03:40.540> eyes<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:41.109> actually<00:03:41.560> more<00:03:41.769> filled<00:03:42.220> in<00:03:42.519> with

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.750 
the L'Oreal one compared to the Smashbox

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
one so it definitely minimizes fine
