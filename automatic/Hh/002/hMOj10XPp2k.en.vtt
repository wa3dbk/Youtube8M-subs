00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello to all and today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.019
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.130
 of clash of plant and in this video I 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.260
 I'm not alone I'm in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.260
 peps company 95 hi to you 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.110
 it comes to him so it's together we have 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.600
 found a bug so a trophy bug 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.129
 so it's mostly fishing that found at 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.110
 his level there is in the crystal in 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.670
 the three crystal nno there he finds 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.290
 really huge trophy bugs 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.930
 since there was a maintenance 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 today after a basket of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 maintenance actually since had the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.149
 end maintenance what are you going to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 talk right after and a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.390
 second now what they did 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 just after I think it was 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.700
 corrections something like that we go there 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.620
 had some bugs to attack because 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.530
 that in fact I think as they pulled out 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.229
 the boost so the booster for the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 extractors of elixir so not the mines 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 and neither the drills and all the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 barracks and heroes is also the factory 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 to leave so to a I like that and so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.190
 that's why I think there was 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 many attacked and so the servers 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.990
 was not enough anymore they had to do 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.030
 Something 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.200
 not so that we can better attack 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 because there are attacks there are 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 people who attack almost every 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:42.540
 two three minutes like you from everything 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:45.409
 time and so so this morning too they 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.789
 have released the boost 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.030
 yes no we do not care about it because 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.840
 I mean so let's say is that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.340
 pass to the bugue 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.109
 I was told I'll let you explained 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.969
 this low bug and especially you who has it 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.829
 noticed in any case in crystal it's 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.630
 remark a lot more than in master me 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:11.690
 I did not really find his 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:13.730
 proven farm which rejects all that the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.690
 shot he used to drink 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.650
 of epinal against 21 33 euros 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.840
 these 33 15 and 34 same time spent under the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 maximum 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.349
 if now you can find 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.000
 images that goes down from 12.3 of 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.739
 busy screenings to find each other 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.959
 during his research 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.190
 so it can go down to three 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.400
 holes created and it can go up to 36 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.420
 38 40 and I saw one everyone so that's it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.319
 so there are guys team can 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.760
 take 40 points 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.889
 so imagine in defense it's not even 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.359
 a revenge so you see that some 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.599
 screens not the good ones in his writings 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:59.930
 next button nancy does not have the button 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.630
 you see it's true for the viola for 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.430
 buy it is true that sometimes before 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.139
 the hole me I was not when I was 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.579
 mounted champions sometimes we find 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.200
 villages that can be won up to 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.500
 thirty nine trophies I had already found 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.739
 in normal research but frankly the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.569
 especially crystal crystal 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.620
 it's not normal at all, there's even 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.630
 there are people who you too have 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.380
 noticed also we saw in 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.380
 castles stuff like that 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.600
 imagine 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.650
 I normal you take 100% 40 too scared 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.800
 if he does not really have it it's just 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.210
 horrible to say I think they saw me 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.460
 quickly correct it anyway we hope 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.660
 because here it's a little bit 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.990
 good after that can benefit people 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.640
 German public to kick 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.960
 especially since we are in the clan 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.380
 resurrection list we're doing a little 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.670
 dedication to airways and here we are 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.740
 left and so if you want to come 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.319
 you can come rock with us there 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.230
 just need 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.060
 I passed criteria really needed 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.280
 have at least 2000 trophy what has 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.299
 scored in any case but I think a little 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.010
 more is in any case must be hot 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.019
 for really rich and beautiful because we 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.760
 really wants to reach the first 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.560
 places of the French top so we have a 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.930
 goal already top 50 but after I think 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.829
 we can go higher, so here we go 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.910
 that's all I had to say that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.180
 it's because the site still has some 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.180
 something to add 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.550
 that's it and if they had the same 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.080
 problems and also I would just like 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.639
 know the leagues they had because 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.039
 that me in fact I'm in master I 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.690
 not at all this problem so that 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.770
 I would like to know if you too 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.509
 are in master if you find this 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.190
 problem or stuff like that 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.949
 I'm selling to know if this concern is that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.539
 in crystal so here I hope you 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.560

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.930
