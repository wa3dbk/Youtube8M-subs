00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
up with a necklace holder for for this

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.570 
up with a necklace holder for for this
because<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.940> keeps<00:03:38.180> popping<00:03:39.050> up<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.400> now<00:03:40.520> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
because it keeps popping up and now to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.350 
because it keeps popping up and now to
keep<00:03:40.820> losing<00:03:41.150> him<00:03:41.270> it's<00:03:41.810> my<00:03:41.989> third<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:43.360> this

this<00:03:44.780> doesn't<00:03:45.140> pop<00:03:45.290> up<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.650> thought<00:03:45.980> this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
this doesn't pop up so I thought this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.330 
this doesn't pop up so I thought this
would<00:03:46.340> be<00:03:46.489> great<00:03:46.670> but<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:48.230> know<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.860> not<00:03:49.070> the

would be great but you know it's not the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.760 
would be great but you know it's not the
app<00:03:49.520> is<00:03:49.760> not<00:03:49.940> as<00:03:50.060> slick<00:03:50.360> as<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:51.440> the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
app is not as slick as the the the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.270 
app is not as slick as the the the
Xiaomi<00:03:52.220> app<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:54.230> know<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.830> gets<00:03:54.950> all<00:03:55.190> these

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
I like the design of it but it lasts

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.310 
I like the design of it but it lasts
three<00:04:05.720> days<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.110> think<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.770> know<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:08.170> don't<00:04:09.170> like

about<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.600> month<00:04:14.600> I<00:04:14.900> mean<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.260> would<00:04:15.380> charge<00:04:15.590> it

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
about a month I mean I would charge it

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.400 
about a month I mean I would charge it
every<00:04:15.830> three<00:04:16.190> weeks<00:04:16.370> or<00:04:16.669> so<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:18.229> very

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
every three weeks or so and be very

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.440 
every three weeks or so and be very
quiet<00:04:18.709> give<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.100> like<00:04:19.280> ten<00:04:19.549> minutes<00:04:19.910> or<00:04:20.180> 20

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
quiet give you like ten minutes or 20

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.909 
quiet give you like ten minutes or 20
minutes<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.140> this<00:04:21.260> would<00:04:21.410> be<00:04:21.530> done<00:04:21.739> I

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
minutes and and this would be done I

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.790 
minutes and and this would be done I
mean<00:04:22.460> they<00:04:23.360> do<00:04:23.419> make<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.720> easy<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.229> charge<00:04:24.500> I

mean they do make it easy to charge I

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.280 
mean they do make it easy to charge I
guess<00:04:25.070> but<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.330> didn't<00:04:26.540> expect<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.080> last

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
guess but I didn't expect it to last

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.400 
guess but I didn't expect it to last
only<00:04:27.620> three<00:04:27.770> days<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.640> was<00:04:29.360> expecting<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:30.290> know

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
what charge at once a week I guess I'll

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.190
