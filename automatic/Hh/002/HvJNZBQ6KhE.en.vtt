00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
been priced hype I mean price the price

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
been priced hype I mean price the price
I've<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.210> hiked<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> even<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> gold<00:01:31.770> here

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I've been hiked and even the gold here

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
I've been hiked and even the gold here
too<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> hike<00:01:32.430> by<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.820> twenty<00:01:33.090> percent<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
too is hike by about twenty percent I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.030 
too is hike by about twenty percent I
think<00:01:33.990> there's<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.200> apps<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> got<00:01:34.619> hacked<00:01:34.860> by

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
think there's some apps I got hacked by

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
think there's some apps I got hacked by
like<00:01:35.189> fifty<00:01:35.520> percent<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
like fifty percent so that is really

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
like fifty percent so that is really
insane<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.310> happened<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
insane and I think this happened about a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
insane and I think this happened about a
week<00:01:38.909> ago<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.049> reason<00:01:40.200> why<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.500> because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
week ago and the reason why is because

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.499 
week ago and the reason why is because
Apple<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.520> Google<00:01:41.549> they're<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> know

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
Apple and Google they're like you know

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.340 
Apple and Google they're like you know
it's<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.079> currency<00:01:43.560> alright<00:01:44.479> sorry<00:01:45.479> is

if it is the currencies fall they should

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
if it is the currencies fall they should
update<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.229> every<00:01:52.619> week<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
update this every week or so because you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
update this every week or so because you
know<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> currency<00:01:54.270> fluctuates<00:01:54.750> quite<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.470> lot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

know the currency fluctuates quite a lot
and<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.939> thought<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.450> lucky<00:01:57.960> european<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.799> think

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and I thought the lucky european i think

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.130 
and I thought the lucky european i think
i<00:01:59.610> think<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.880> pound<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:00.990> used

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
i think the pound is what they used

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
i think the pound is what they used
right<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.439> ah<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:03.329> UK<00:02:03.750> i<00:02:03.960> used<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.159> pound

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
right in ah the UK i used the pound

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
right in ah the UK i used the pound
pound<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.360> bother<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> pound

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pound right I bother you that the pound

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
pound right I bother you that the pound
is<00:02:07.560> actually<00:02:07.770> doing<00:02:07.979> real<00:02:08.160> good<00:02:08.190> compared<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
is actually doing real good compared to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
is actually doing real good compared to
the<00:02:08.910> dollar<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.229> thought<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.770> euros

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the dollar and I thought the euros

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.470 
the dollar and I thought the euros
actually<00:02:11.400> doing<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> bad<00:02:11.940> too<00:02:12.180> but

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
actually doing that bad too but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
actually doing that bad too but
apparently<00:02:12.540> why<00:02:13.379> not

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
apparently why not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
apparently why not
canadian<00:02:14.640> dollars<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.450> low<00:02:15.600> now

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
canadian dollars actually really low now

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.640 
canadian dollars actually really low now
um<00:02:16.740> he<00:02:16.980> dropped<00:02:17.250> quite<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> bit<00:02:17.640> i<00:02:18.209> wiii<00:02:18.620> about<00:02:19.620> a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
um he dropped quite a bit i wiii about a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.440 
um he dropped quite a bit i wiii about a
year<00:02:19.950> ago<00:02:19.980> or<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.640> two<00:02:20.790> years<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.360> were

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
year ago or like two years that we were

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.830 
year ago or like two years that we were
ahead<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:22.620> were<00:02:22.709> ahead<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:23.940> quite<00:02:24.270> we

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
ahead we were ahead but now we quite we

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.170 
ahead we were ahead but now we quite we
dropped<00:02:25.050> quite<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.850> makes<00:02:27.030> sense

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
dropped quite a bit and that makes sense

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.020 
dropped quite a bit and that makes sense
i<00:02:27.330> guess<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.680> price<00:02:29.280> hike<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> other

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
i guess but the price hike and the other

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
i guess but the price hike and the other
countries<00:02:30.450> i<00:02:30.600> don't<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:30.840> know<00:02:31.110> why

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
countries i don't really know why

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.350 
countries i don't really know why
because<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.190> know<00:02:32.340> some<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.850> wreck<00:02:33.000> like

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
because you know some of the wreck like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.600 
because you know some of the wreck like
currencies<00:02:33.840> are<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.320> like<00:02:34.860> way<00:02:35.280> stronger

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
currencies are going like way stronger

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.650 
currencies are going like way stronger
while<00:02:37.430> some<00:02:38.430> other<00:02:38.580> countries<00:02:39.030> they're<00:02:39.390> going

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
while some other countries they're going

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.690 
while some other countries they're going
down<00:02:39.840> but<00:02:40.500> yeah<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> price<00:02:41.340> hike<00:02:41.550> is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
down but yeah so the price hike is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.930 
down but yeah so the price hike is
because<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.270> Apple<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.319> Google<00:02:43.489> not<00:02:44.489> machines

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
because of Apple and Google not machines

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.360 
because of Apple and Google not machines
own<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.410> basic<00:02:46.680> effect<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.100> basically

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
own and this basic effect that basically

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.820 
own and this basic effect that basically
everything<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.940> their<00:02:48.180> app<00:02:48.989> store<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.680> there

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
everything in their app store so there

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.160 
everything in their app store so there
is<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.880> don't<00:02:51.090> worry<00:02:51.209> guess<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is that so don't worry guess it was a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.930 
is that so don't worry guess it was a
machines<00:02:52.530> own<00:02:52.709> fault<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.280> let's<00:02:53.580> give<00:02:53.730> them<00:02:53.820> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
machines own fault so let's give them a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.360 
machines own fault so let's give them a
break<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.570> quite<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> bit<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.140> yes<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.160> let<00:02:56.280> me

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
break for quite a bit and yes so let me

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.650
