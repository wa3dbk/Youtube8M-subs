00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.560 

and<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.790> see<00:01:48.970> they've<00:01:49.210> actually

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
and we can see they've actually

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.010 
and we can see they've actually
populated<00:01:50.530> with<00:01:51.070> our<00:01:51.250> plugins<00:01:51.870> so<00:01:52.870> we're

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
populated with our plugins so we're

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.510 
populated with our plugins so we're
going<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.170> just<00:01:53.410> select<00:01:53.680> those<00:01:54.040> two<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.430> we

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
going to just select those two that we

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.010 
going to just select those two that we
just<00:01:54.670> added<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:56.250> bulk<00:01:58.260> activate<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.690> that's

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
just added and bulk activate and that's

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
just added and bulk activate and that's
done<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.860> reason<00:02:03.070> why<00:02:03.160> we<00:02:03.280> had<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.490> add

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
done so the reason why we had to add

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190 
done so the reason why we had to add
visual<00:02:04.780> composer<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:07.390> you're<00:02:07.600> creating

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
visual composer is when you're creating

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.360 
visual composer is when you're creating
a<00:02:08.260> page<00:02:08.530> for<00:02:09.130> example<00:02:09.510> I'm<00:02:10.860> editing<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.130> home

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
a page for example I'm editing this home

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.340 
a page for example I'm editing this home
page<00:02:14.220> without<00:02:15.220> visual<00:02:15.640> composer<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:17.110> won't

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
page without visual composer you won't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.780 
page without visual composer you won't
actually<00:02:17.560> be<00:02:17.740> able<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.070> create<00:02:18.490> all<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
actually be able to create all the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
actually be able to create all the
different<00:02:19.120> sections<00:02:19.390> yeah<00:02:22.410> well<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.650> will<00:02:23.830> be

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
different sections yeah well you will be

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.560 
different sections yeah well you will be
able<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.160> do<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.490> won't<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:24.970> easy<00:02:25.000> as

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
able to do it but it won't be as easy as

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.540 
able to do it but it won't be as easy as
if<00:02:25.780> he<00:02:25.900> has<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:27.930> visual<00:02:28.930> composer

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
if he has if you have visual composer

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
if he has if you have visual composer
