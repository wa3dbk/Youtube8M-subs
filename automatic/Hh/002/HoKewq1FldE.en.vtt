napkin<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.470> exactly<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> same

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
napkin but it's exactly the same

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.380 
napkin but it's exactly the same
principle<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> use<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
principle if you want to use a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.040 
principle if you want to use a
disposable<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.719> thing<00:00:33.809> we're

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
disposable one so the first thing we're

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.549 
disposable one so the first thing we're
going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.739> fold<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.070> napkin<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.640> half

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
going to do is to fold a napkin in half

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.389 
going to do is to fold a napkin in half
we're<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> fold<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> half

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
we're then going to fold it in half

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.290 
we're then going to fold it in half
again<00:00:40.520> like<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.270 

now<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> fold<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.260> words<00:00:49.710> but

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
now we're going to fold it up words but

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.639 
now we're going to fold it up words but
keep<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.969> finger<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.930> point<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:54.649> fold

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
keep your finger at that point and fold

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
keep your finger at that point and fold
it<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.339> on<00:00:56.809> one<00:00:57.809> side<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.589> this<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.479> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it down on one side like this this is so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.649 
it down on one side like this this is so
we<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> fold<00:01:01.379> exactly<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> middle

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
we get the fold exactly in the middle

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.520 
we get the fold exactly in the middle
we're<00:01:03.659> now<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.050> do<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> other

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
side can you see how it kind of makes a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
side can you see how it kind of makes a
house<00:01:09.810> shape<00:01:11.840> now<00:01:12.840> turn<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.229> upside<00:01:13.440> down
