00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.410
 as a half mx 5 ballan boxing 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.480
 thanks as always big shaw puntonet 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.480
 for devices in Prometheus limpa 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.010
 purchase at the terminal came from 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.650
 very little indeed is presented by 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.480
 very little but already jas we have here in 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.769
 try this should be the version 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.650
 Chinese 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.810
 however this problem and then one 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.250
 review by i will explain why then 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.750
 obviously we have the phone that 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.829
 already removed because I'm already trying to 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.730
 more than a few days indeed 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.140
 of ignition to charges or immediately thereafter 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.600
 fair paper we fed 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.750
 redouane because for the recharge in short 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 for quick charging 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.550
 one thing 4 the usb micro cable lover 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.390
 usb 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.809
 obviously missing in this version 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.949
 cap beone to the action we say 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.949
 international should should 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.629
 be there or see the phone here 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.309
 so I started as always 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.470
 nice bit of years up for this phone 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.840
 share subscribe to many at 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.189
 canal light up to live turned on 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.329
 unlock with fingerprints like 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.920
 see let's talk immediately about 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.590
 features and design 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.759
 then we'll do review theory up here 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.290
 right for the full review 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.659
 phone entirely in aluminum I see 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.600
 very well except this part with in 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.100
 low it looks and even nab seem 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 more chaste what awaits this part 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.240
 central in which said that even more 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.680
 cold compared to the 2 cable ties 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.500
 whites and blues turning off 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.909
 sweaty hot right bordin obviously 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.250
 well finished as you see the upper part 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.189
 we have input for headphones 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.979
 second microphone left side entrance 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.289
 for sim the pads dual sim 4g phones 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.060
 obviously simi format hand in return 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.920
 of yes in part low we have 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.590
 the first microphone input speaker 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.990
 micro usb on the back lake middle 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.509
 20.7 megapixel camera with 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.229
 autofocus and double flash LED even if it is 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.450
 all in the same if in the same 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.990
 the reborn on two with two shades 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.180
 different fair and laser focus a 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.990
 then we have the flai mi edge 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.940
 interface people 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.180
 used by the maze we talk about 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.440
 characteristics and dimensions 14.9 7.5 cm 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.820
 7 salmonid point while thickness 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.300
 obviously in a subtle camera mode 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.680
 slightly protruding weight 149 stems 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.750
 therefore also beautiful of the geo can be 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.690
 however quite large indeed 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.440
 Display 15.5-inch Full HD 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.150
 401 pixar and superamoled thumbs 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.800
 new technology let's say by means of the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 brave if not the first that uses a 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.670
 I love and it seems to me as far as from 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:54.050
 processor from a media talk opts with mps 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.790
 195 from 2.2 64 bit giger and then to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.940
 understand the same that we will find also 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.600
 on the store and its then one 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.520
 clarification that there is also a gpu is the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.770
 pau and vrg 6.200 mp4 the memory from 16 32 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.750
 or 64 gigabytes depending on the version 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.910
 in this case it is the one with 16 not 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.840
 expandable and 3 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.690
 20.7 megapixel camera sensor sonia 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.120
 of here the same that we will find on the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.800
 suam background to say that these two 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.140
 phones are very similar in terms of 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.420
 technical features some bags 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.180
 difference such as the displays here 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.770
 in full HD on the stonex will be a quad 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.160
 happenings here in a blue car a 5 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.870
 megapixel with 38 of the stonex he had 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.300
 also with expandable memory and 32gb of 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.770
 base memory so this is a bit 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.150
 different however sense is interesting 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.250
 then with a 22.3-inch stroke then 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.650
 big enough to make sense of a 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.930
 of a smartphone and battery not 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.790
 removable, give me 150 million is in 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.250
 in this case the battery is bigger 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.190
 here compared to the stomach 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.490
 in short, a month or so about something 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.260
 less 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.210
 bonn then question features 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.670
 very very interesting as a telephone 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.410
 absolutely we have from notification cup 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.830
 his regular front camera e 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.470
 we have a physical key taking without 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.489
 let's say touching then soft touch 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.670
 feel the same as the back button 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.440
 mendel having as it should be using 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.530
 applications let's go back and 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 anything else with a function 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.830
 very very smart we also have 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.540
 sorry we also have the double tap for 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.389
 block it but in this case not always 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.160
 committed a step and the good of the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.350
 non digital unlocking I must say that it 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.139
 unlocking is really something 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.460
 exceptional therefore includes quoted from 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.870
 mind one of the fastest are the most 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.940
 fast that I never even tried 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 better than the iPhone six 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.139
 absolutely that maybe it was the best 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.450
 until now followed immediately to 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.400
 wheel from ssn and chat etc. 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.200
 so for this unboxing and all a 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.000
 very soon indeed 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.800
 full review I repeat that link with 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.960
 cars are quite a nod to either 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.700
 a few years review to us 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.750
 so the videogame lorenzo pes went there 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.750
 think bye bye now
