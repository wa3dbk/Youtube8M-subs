00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
tried it before because they thought it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
tried it before because they thought it
was<00:00:53.670> too<00:00:53.699> difficult<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
was too difficult to do and I know that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
was too difficult to do and I know that
all<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> people<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.329> who<00:00:57.510> make

that<00:02:28.530> now<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:29.769> not<00:02:29.920> sure<00:02:30.010> whether<00:02:30.700> you're

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
using one or two pumps yet obviously

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.410 
using one or two pumps yet obviously
using<00:02:33.340> two<00:02:33.459> pots<00:02:33.700> increases<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.299> performance

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
using two pots increases the performance

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
using two pots increases the performance
but<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.139> also<00:02:35.260> makes<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.709> louder

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
but it also makes it louder

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.369 
but it also makes it louder

clear flexible tubing also gonna be

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.759 
clear flexible tubing also gonna be
using<00:03:21.250> phobias<00:03:21.879> super<00:03:22.389> Sara<00:03:22.629> Evy<00:03:23.139> red<00:03:23.290> coolant

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
using phobias super Sara Evy red coolant

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.159 
using phobias super Sara Evy red coolant
now<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.250> don't<00:03:24.489> plan<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.909> use<00:03:25.000> UV<00:03:25.389> lights<00:03:25.599> so<00:03:26.049> it

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
now I don't plan to use UV lights so it

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.199 
now I don't plan to use UV lights so it
won't<00:03:26.349> be<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.650> deep<00:03:26.799> red<00:03:26.979> it<00:03:27.099> should<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.180> I

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
won't be the deep red it should be but I

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.039 
won't be the deep red it should be but I
don't<00:03:28.449> mind<00:03:28.629> this<00:03:28.810> pinkish<00:03:29.169> tinge<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.870> that's

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
don't mind this pinkish tinge so that's

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.289 
don't mind this pinkish tinge so that's
all<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.229> parts<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.620> new<00:03:32.769> easing<00:03:33.159> so<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.090> plan

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
all the parts of new easing so the plan

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.729 
all the parts of new easing so the plan
is<00:03:34.329> it's<00:03:34.870> like<00:03:35.229> I<00:03:35.349> said<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
is it's like I said to have the

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.520 
is it's like I said to have the
resonator<00:03:36.099> hair<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.720> get<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> 90<00:03:38.319> degree

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
resonator hair and to get a 90 degree

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.490 
resonator hair and to get a 90 degree
angle<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.790> tube<00:03:40.030> goes<00:03:40.209> straight<00:03:40.989> back<00:03:41.049> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
angle so the tube goes straight back and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.229 
angle so the tube goes straight back and
behind<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.889> Ray<00:03:42.009> jr.<00:03:42.250> straight<00:03:42.909> into<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
behind the Ray jr. straight into the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.969 
behind the Ray jr. straight into the
reservoir<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.049> hopefully<00:03:44.439> most<00:03:44.829> of<00:03:44.919> this

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
reservoir so hopefully most of this

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.369 
reservoir so hopefully most of this
sheep<00:03:45.250> should<00:03:45.430> be<00:03:45.489> hidden<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:46.870> she'd<00:03:47.169> go

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
sheep should be hidden then she'd go

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.020 
sheep should be hidden then she'd go
straight<00:03:47.650> from<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.889> earth<00:03:48.129> reservoirs<00:03:48.609> at

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
straight from the earth reservoirs at

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.479 
straight from the earth reservoirs at
CPU<00:03:49.329> block<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:50.139> strike<00:03:50.620> from<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.919> CPU<00:03:51.280> block

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
CPU block and strike from the CPU block

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.059 
CPU block and strike from the CPU block
to<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.669> radiator<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.650> should<00:03:53.799> look<00:03:53.919> quite

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
to the radiator so it should look quite

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.219 
to the radiator so it should look quite
pretty<00:03:54.250> quite<00:03:54.489> tidy<00:03:54.699> and<00:03:54.939> simple<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:56.079> look

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
pretty quite tidy and simple and look

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.229 
pretty quite tidy and simple and look
quite<00:03:56.379> good<00:03:56.489> now<00:03:57.489> I'm<00:03:57.609> not<00:03:57.790> sure<00:03:57.939> which<00:03:58.060> one

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
quite good now I'm not sure which one

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.580 
quite good now I'm not sure which one
I'm<00:03:58.299> gonna<00:03:58.419> have<00:03:58.479> the<00:03:58.659> flow<00:03:58.840> going<00:03:59.109> yet<00:03:59.379> I'm

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
I'm gonna have the flow going yet I'm

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.309 
I'm gonna have the flow going yet I'm
just<00:03:59.919> pens<00:04:00.159> which<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.459> think<00:04:00.699> looks<00:04:00.879> better<00:04:01.319> but

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
just pens which I think looks better but

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.129 
just pens which I think looks better but
yeah<00:04:02.500> that's<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.859> basic<00:04:03.159> plan<00:04:03.400> in<00:04:04.359> my<00:04:04.659> phobia

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
yeah that's the basic plan in my phobia

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.199 
yeah that's the basic plan in my phobia

so this is part one of what I'd like to
call<00:04:17.349> project<00:04:17.739> run<00:04:17.889> it's<00:04:18.549> not<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.759> best<00:04:18.940> name

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
call project run it's not the best name

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.729 
call project run it's not the best name
but<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.900> just<00:04:20.019> popped<00:04:20.199> into<00:04:20.289> my<00:04:20.469> head<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.680> I

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
but it just popped into my head and I

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.339 
but it just popped into my head and I
liked<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:20.949> so<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:22.210> plan<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.449> after<00:04:22.779> the<00:04:23.020> initial

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
liked it so my plan is after the initial

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.190 
liked it so my plan is after the initial
loop<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.770> might<00:04:24.039> expand<00:04:24.460> on<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.699> some<00:04:24.880> more

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
loop I might expand on it some more

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.410 
loop I might expand on it some more
hit<00:04:25.500> my<00:04:25.590> new<00:04:25.710> dremel<00:04:26.100> out<00:04:26.220> arm<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.300> have

hit my new dremel out arm you just have
to<00:04:27.480> wait<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.690> see<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> guess<00:04:27.930> but<00:04:28.410> that's<00:04:28.530> all

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740
