00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
we see all those icons that we just

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.860 
we see all those icons that we just
added<00:02:30.079> go<00:02:31.079> through<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:32.359> we<00:02:33.359> can<00:02:33.510> edit<00:02:33.690> them

you<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.739> right<00:02:35.220> there<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.440> can<00:02:37.560> go<00:02:37.650> back

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
you know right there and we can go back

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:46.450 
you know right there and we can go back
to<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.100> screen

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.840 

okay<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.570> we<00:02:47.690> wanted<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.990> open<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.410> them<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
okay so we wanted to open up them the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.020 
okay so we wanted to open up them the
stack<00:02:51.340> get<00:02:52.340> straight<00:02:52.670> in

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.140 

so<00:02:57.660> instead<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.410> having<00:02:58.610> four<00:02:59.610> or<00:02:59.700> five<00:02:59.880> pages

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
so instead of having four or five pages

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.870 
so instead of having four or five pages
of<00:03:00.540> stuff<00:03:00.630> now<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.319> can<00:03:02.010> condense<00:03:02.340> all<00:03:02.550> those

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
of stuff now I can condense all those

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.020 
of stuff now I can condense all those
into<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.480> maybe<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.990> don't<00:03:04.110> use<00:03:04.470> too<00:03:04.740> much<00:03:05.030> of

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
into one maybe I don't use too much of

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.550 
into one maybe I don't use too much of
the<00:03:06.209> stock<00:03:06.540> applications<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the stock applications like the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.360 
the stock applications like the
calculator<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> clock<00:03:09.060> or<00:03:09.510> photos<00:03:10.370> just

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
calculator and the clock or photos just

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.910 
calculator and the clock or photos just
throw<00:03:11.640> those<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.030> there<00:03:12.330> I'm<00:03:13.080> condensed<00:03:13.709> into

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
throw those on there I'm condensed into

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.959 
throw those on there I'm condensed into
one<00:03:14.750> alright<00:03:15.750> Khan
