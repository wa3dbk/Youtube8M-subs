George<00:00:29.070> where<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.849> pretty<00:00:30.060> close<00:00:30.269> if<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
George where I was pretty close if you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
see my video that I did predict him what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
see my video that I did predict him what
it'd<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.360> said<00:00:33.809> he'd<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.050> 90<00:00:34.440> overall

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it'd be like I said he'd have 90 overall

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.549 
it'd be like I said he'd have 90 overall
he<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.010> 89<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.670> said<00:00:36.090> I'd<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.270> 92<00:00:36.600> Pacey<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.110> 93

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
he was 89 I said I'd have 92 Pacey at 93

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.080 
he was 89 I said I'd have 92 Pacey at 93
is<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:37.890> close<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.940> his

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is pretty close but as you can see his

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.200 
is pretty close but as you can see his
main<00:00:39.270> attributes<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:39.989> 85<00:00:40.410> dribbling<00:00:41.210> 86

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
main attributes I was 85 dribbling 86

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
main attributes I was 85 dribbling 86

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
shooting an 85 head in so he's a pretty

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
shooting an 85 head in so he's a pretty
decent<00:00:45.180> card<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:46.110> perfect<00:00:46.590> where<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
decent card has got perfect where it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
decent card has got perfect where it
rates<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.600> freestyle<00:00:48.600> wafers<00:00:48.930> with

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
rates as well freestyle wafers with

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.319 
rates as well freestyle wafers with
disappointing<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.820> four-star<00:00:50.820> skill<00:00:51.090> moves

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
disappointing and four-star skill moves

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
disappointing and four-star skill moves
but<00:00:51.480> he'll<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.989> absolute<00:00:52.559> monster<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.129> use

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
but he'll be an absolute monster to use

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.170 
but he'll be an absolute monster to use

shooting<00:02:40.020> as<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.530> mean<00:02:40.740> he's<00:02:40.830> got<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.980> high

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
shooting as well I mean he's got a high

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.530 
shooting as well I mean he's got a high
overall<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.760> probably<00:02:41.940> will<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.450> be
