00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.869 
they were on Yamaha hubs on I got the
ones<00:00:52.170> AB<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:57.649> they're<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:59.309> hard<00:00:59.550> tires

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
ones AB and they're really hard tires

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.750

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
monopoly on tires at these take the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.200 
monopoly on tires at these take the
bumps<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.689> better<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:08.909> get

really<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.540> traction<00:01:09.780> too<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.350> they

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really good traction too because they

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
really good traction too because they

the front

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.670 
the front
I'm<00:03:40.480> gonna<00:03:40.630> put<00:03:40.900> new<00:03:41.020> wheel<00:03:41.170> bearings<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
I'm gonna put new wheel bearings in it

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.040 
I'm gonna put new wheel bearings in it
because<00:03:41.860> they're<00:03:42.040> very<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.670> shot<00:03:43.030> I'm<00:03:43.660> gonna

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
because they're very very shot I'm gonna

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.350 
because they're very very shot I'm gonna
put<00:03:44.230> good<00:03:44.440> brakes<00:03:44.709> in<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.920> front<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:48.360> would

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
put good brakes in the front and I would

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.729 
put good brakes in the front and I would
imagine<00:03:49.540> more<00:03:49.959> people<00:03:50.290> probably<00:03:50.470> want<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
imagine more people probably want to

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.960 
imagine more people probably want to
ride<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.010> thing<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.459> want<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:51.850> write

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
ride this thing I know I want to write

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.270 
ride this thing I know I want to write
it<00:03:52.090> more<00:03:52.209> because<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.900> front<00:03:53.770> suspension<00:03:54.220> is

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
it more because that front suspension is

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.540 
it more because that front suspension is
just<00:03:54.430> gonna<00:03:54.520> make<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.760> world<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.270> difference

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
just gonna make a world of difference

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.790 
just gonna make a world of difference
it's<00:03:57.550> gonna<00:03:57.670> be<00:03:57.820> slow<00:03:58.120> because<00:03:58.989> it's<00:03:59.650> gonna

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
it's gonna be slow because it's gonna

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.440 
it's gonna be slow because it's gonna
feel<00:04:00.040> like<00:04:00.100> it<00:04:00.220> should<00:04:00.370> be<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> 200<00:04:00.910> s<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.300> it's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
feel like it should be a 200 s but it's

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.690 
feel like it should be a 200 s but it's
steep<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.170> that's<00:04:02.350> gonna<00:04:02.530> have<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.860> six

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
steep and that's gonna have the six

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.590 
steep and that's gonna have the six
horsepower<00:04:04.000> 10<00:04:04.959> horsepower<00:04:05.230> or<00:04:05.500> whatever

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
horsepower 10 horsepower or whatever

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.020 
horsepower 10 horsepower or whatever
whatever<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:09.040> reverse<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.520> gonna<00:04:09.700> make<00:04:09.850> up

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
whatever the reverse is gonna make up

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.760 
whatever the reverse is gonna make up
for<00:04:10.180> everything<00:04:10.980> so

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770

t-rex 125 motor which doesn't have high

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.250 
t-rex 125 motor which doesn't have high
and<00:04:28.850> low<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.210> it's<00:04:29.330> got<00:04:29.450> five<00:04:29.690> gears<00:04:29.990> in

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
and low but it's got five gears in

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.650 
and low but it's got five gears in
Reverse<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:31.640> bolts<00:04:31.940> right<00:04:32.090> up<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.420> just<00:04:32.570> have

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
Reverse it bolts right up you just have

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.890 
Reverse it bolts right up you just have
to<00:04:32.840> switch<00:04:33.050> out<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.270> there's<00:04:35.270> wire<00:04:35.570> length

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
to switch out the there's wire length

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.540 
to switch out the there's wire length
issue<00:04:36.200> so<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:36.890> have<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.130> switch<00:04:37.370> out

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
issue so you just have to switch out

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.050 
issue so you just have to switch out
some<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:38.030> your<00:04:38.120> wires<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.720> think<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:40.700> just<00:04:40.850> so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
some of your wires I think it's just so

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.690 
some of your wires I think it's just so
freakin<00:04:41.420> easy<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.750> switch<00:04:41.960> out<00:04:42.520> like<00:04:43.520> the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
freakin easy to switch out like the

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.050 
freakin easy to switch out like the
pickup<00:04:44.180> wire<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:45.050> then<00:04:45.470> 200<00:04:46.010> s<00:04:46.100> forks<00:04:46.520> you

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
pickup wire and then 200 s forks you

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.240 
pickup wire and then 200 s forks you
know<00:04:47.180> if<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:47.660> can<00:04:47.780> find<00:04:48.020> them<00:04:48.170> use<00:04:48.800> somewhere

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
know if you can find them use somewhere

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.220 
know if you can find them use somewhere
then<00:04:50.150> you're<00:04:50.270> gonna<00:04:50.360> have<00:04:50.480> front<00:04:50.720> suspension

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
then you're gonna have front suspension

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.230 
then you're gonna have front suspension
and<00:04:51.410> that's<00:04:51.920> gonna<00:04:52.100> make<00:04:52.670> another<00:04:52.910> world<00:04:53.120> of

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
and that's gonna make another world of

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.630 
and that's gonna make another world of
difference<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.890> would<00:04:54.890> say<00:04:55.130> get<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.430> with<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
difference I would say get it with the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.060 
difference I would say get it with the
200s<00:04:56.180> headlight<00:04:56.570> assembly<00:04:57.170> that's<00:04:57.710> easy<00:04:57.890> to
