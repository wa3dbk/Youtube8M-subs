00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
anything like that I just didn't care

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.710 
anything like that I just didn't care
for<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:45.110> all<00:04:45.200> that<00:04:45.380> much<00:04:45.560> but<00:04:46.550> what<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.360> still

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
for it all that much but what it still

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.300 
for it all that much but what it still
had<00:04:47.900> its<00:04:47.930> funny<00:04:48.290> moments<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:48.980> like<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:49.250> said

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
had its funny moments and like I said

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.310 
had its funny moments and like I said
it's<00:04:49.610> very<00:04:49.670> hard<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.150> them<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.720> do<00:04:50.810> an<00:04:50.930> episode

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
it's very hard for them to do an episode

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.190 
it's very hard for them to do an episode
that<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.590> absolutely<00:04:52.070> hate<00:04:52.730> Tory<00:04:53.240> gets<00:04:53.480> Tory

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880
