00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.380 
being able to do that D strumming quite
a<00:02:07.810> few<00:02:08.050> times<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.530> row<00:02:08.709> she<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.610> move<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:10.179> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
a few times in a row she can move on to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.580 
a few times in a row she can move on to
the<00:02:10.509> G<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.440> you're<00:02:12.280> doing<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.760> G<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.319> third

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
the G so you're doing a G with the third

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.650 
the G so you're doing a G with the third
finger<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.160> remains<00:02:15.550> rooted<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.180> from<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> D

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
finger that remains rooted so from the D

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.810 
finger that remains rooted so from the D
that<00:02:17.470> one<00:02:17.590> stairs<00:02:17.890> there<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.310> then<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.580> make

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
that one stairs there and then you make

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.780 
that one stairs there and then you make

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the G like this a big G these are

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.350 
the G like this a big G these are
censoring<00:02:22.300> my<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.840> minor<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.610> do<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.970> you

second fret on the a string and then you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.520 
second fret on the a string and then you
move<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.420> second<00:02:34.810> thing<00:02:34.989> you're<00:02:35.110> down<00:02:35.260> onto

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the D string on the second fret you do

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:49.270 
the D string on the second fret you do
the<00:02:37.030> E<00:02:37.060> minor

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800 

and<00:02:49.670> that's<00:02:49.850> as<00:02:49.970> far<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.180> we're<00:02:50.360> going<00:02:50.660> this

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and that's as far as we're going this

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.780 
and that's as far as we're going this
time<00:02:51.170> because<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.100> as<00:02:52.340> far<00:02:52.490> as<00:02:52.550> we<00:02:52.670> got

time because that's as far as we got

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.180 
time because that's as far as we got
with<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.060> lesson<00:02:53.420> but<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.890> do<00:02:55.010> get

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.820 
it sounds like so now if you watch all
your<00:03:17.030> downs<00:03:17.630> shouldn't<00:03:18.290> go<00:03:18.380> into<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> click

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820 
I believe if she achieves the first part
