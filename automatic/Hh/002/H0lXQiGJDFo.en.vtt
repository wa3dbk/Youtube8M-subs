00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.560
 I as well am glad we did not me 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.910
 spent shovel do not worry at least since 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.880
 I come to explain the changes that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.349
 there were four awards in the patch 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 link laws so that you do not have to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.150
 bother to make them and you have to warn 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 in this patch there is a journey of change 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.830
 huge is huge is gendarme that said of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.450
 she will start with the most basic 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.700
 changes in the champions in this patch 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
 there have been two reviews of ringer and 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.300
 the one of serious the one of rank also not 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.490
 we know and simba has returned to kill 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 scar but whose month is interesting the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 changes that have made the renga as 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.679
 you know the revisions are changes by 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.179
 complete is to say all the skills 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.249
 and the way the champions of 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.600
 work the object also the fang 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.600
 I had to buy you as a hostage gar 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.190
 to operate at your maximum utility for 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 say it somehow you no longer have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.579
 that buying it is a free trinket 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.140
 but the one I liked the most was 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.120
 the changes that you have made add 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.359
 because he has gone from being a fat man with a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.159
 magic hat that says or threw you two 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.440
 barrels and they 're dead because I'm like that 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.269
 from pimps to be a fighter with a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.979
 little bit of overweight he says he threw me 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.600
 on top of you I have much more use with 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.970
 the skills a little bit of damage 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.950
 magical but more 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.280
 I focused on it being half a half tank 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 magical fight as I just said total 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.780
 I really like the idea I can not tell you 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.570
 still if it's going to be better or worse than what 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.820
 that there was before blah blah blah but the idea 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.200
 itself I love the new great gas that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.000
 there are later with the most changes 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 punctual and small to lioness land 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.710
 softened the shield the w to leasing 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.660
 they have also changed their respective w 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.690
 if you put the shield on you 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.370
 The same thing about an ally does not change anything 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.100
 you have less cooling I even think 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.920
 but if you throw yourself with the shield or with 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.540
 the w in jump to a totem you have more 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.670
 cooling it had before 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 this patch why because it's the way 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.300
 that have to punish a character 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.060
 have a free flash every 10 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.340
 seconds that a good leasing is a whore 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.140
 nightmare so basically you keep 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.300
 having a lot of mobility with design this 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.100
 the other but now when you jump towards 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.950
 a totem you have more cooling in that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.570
 jump and neither receive the shield almost 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.979
 has a space now jiffy 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.080
 between the two times he uses the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.959
 last and if you improve the last 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.910
 no longer make you less damage to towers 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.050
 student ability power to call her 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.390
 that way he talks 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.580
 quite the student support that the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.380
 style that I like to me of 1 is worth 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.690
 a little less damage but good to the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.100
 fucking fatigue that greetings from 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.200
 skill in media and that fucks them more 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.600
 but good you're going to suck it because that 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.400
 character played that way is disgusting 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.530
 ay melvyn grant talking to the turrets 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.830
 in general and every time you throw the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.530
 elite turret no longer appears with a 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 This fucking shit that says how the fuck 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.030
 the dwarf of the balls is killing me 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.100
 Well, he's not going to keep giving you that ass 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.560
 and will continue without seeing it come but with 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.390
 a little less radio out there or with 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.010
 apparently you split a couple to see you 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.290
 for less now so it 's fine that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.730
 and if he has less range with his attacks 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.320
 basic reminds me a lot of the change that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.030
 they made a trip of the century to 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.010
 who then more or less more of the same 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.660
 they have been softening little by little 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.550
 until leaving it in a middle place now 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.380
 there were also small helps to certain 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.150
 Fortune characters have retouched him 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.740
 basically the numbers in all the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.510
 but still it works the same skills 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.800
 more or less so it's a matter of 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.900
 Take a look at what you do 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.300
 boy to serious also helps a little to 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.610
 level to stick stick too and they do this 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.610
 you have changed your with and now to 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.070
 principle the last king net are in less 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.200
 dangerous than before but as 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.850
 you level up is more dangerous than 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.860
 before it does more damage it gives you a little bit more 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.510
 of such life and get curious what 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.340
 who have done the following the other 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.350
 huge section of changes that there was a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.940
 this patch changed in the objects the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.760
 first of all I'm going to read it because it's 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.610
 that is a jewel says we keep trying 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.170
 the blue talismans result for 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.959
 not sad 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.970
 and then fuck you can you tell me 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.890
 that at a specific moment in the game 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.920
 in a certain situation it is useful 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.690
 but the object is crap has a 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.080
 little more of scope and the vision that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.840
 contributes hard passes 2 seconds instead of 1 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.970
 but it's still a leg those with the 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.620
 spirit of the lizard 10% less 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.000
 of hurting monsters as I said 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.080
 there are a lot of new objects the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.430
 first is the next object with the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.940
 more aggressive name after the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.829
 bravura is an object that is formed 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.269
 from the restless lamp but you do not have 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.870
 to buy it you just have to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.060
 kill 25 giant monsters is to say to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.060
 what's in the jungle and it transforms 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.360
 another object new ether breeze is 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.850
 basically a new icon in the store 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.410
 there is already nothing super drastic with 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.240
 this simply causes the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.919
 recipe in a couple of objects but what 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.810
 yes it has made it change quite is the 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.760
 idol banned the other new object that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.160
 there is the generation of blablabla mana 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.900
 cooling but has also done that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.639
 change both the model I do not with as the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.930
 emblem of the ascension and this is when 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.060
 already begin to put change in the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.190
 support objects because apart from the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.690
 emblem of the ascension that is more expensive 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.030
 but it gives a little more statistics 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.620
 they have done the same with the other two the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.600
 edge of the ice queen and the breastplate of 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.130
 ride will cost a little bit more but 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.990
 also the statistics they give are a 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.270
 little better the will of the ancients 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.680
 masks no longer mana regeneration and 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.840
 more can the shield's ability 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.660
 legion and the solar and have stopped giving 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.460
 mature they no longer give anything of armor but 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.810
 I really did not buy it 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.160
 If you wanted armor, I bought it for you 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.710
 when I wanted magical resistance that is 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.690
 that makes sense and how they have done 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.490
 changes that I will explain later with 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.740
 the armor in this patch have said 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.690
 let's remove it from here because it was the 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.790
 glacial shroud less money less 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.980
 armor menu manna the magic of the guardian 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.260
 just change the recipe but are no longer 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.390
 small armor let's say is the vest 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.950
 this one of powerful armor plus a 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.170
 little gold the ice gauntlet 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.240
 now it costs less but it also gives less 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.120
 Armor and the heart of ice costs 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.310
 less but gives a little more armor 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.930
 although the speed of attack that 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.330
 reduce the people who are close to you 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.330
 when you buy the subject is 5% 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.130
 smaller than before is if everything that has 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.080
 armor in this game have changed it 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.240
 the last patch another thing that they have 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.580
 changed enchantment for the boots you 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.590
 and I anybody in most of the 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.450
 cases they bought you only one 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.670
 enchantment to get fucked from 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.620
 the base with lightning coming out of your ass 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.240
 which I like more about the circle that is 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.520
 what they have basically done that 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.650
 enchantment the one of safe have it 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.270
 reduced a little bit and everyone else 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.280
 they have improved them slightly so that 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.260
 be a little more attractive to catch you is 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.580
 another enchantment for the boots that 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.800
 simply the one that is caught all the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.050
 world plus change we leave gestures to 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.790
 move on to summoned spells 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.320
 both the new one and the priest have 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.510
 slightly improved it will have to be 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.940
 an eye is quite curious now and 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.740
 learn another very funny thing now 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.240
 as you put fire on someone 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.770
 you are also seeing him 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.449
 so if you throw the light on 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.860
 someone and gets into a grass or bend 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.349
 a corner you will be able to continue seeing 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.870
 as long as you have the active power on and what 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.030
 more important that there is in that patch the 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.210
 lava color the changes in the runes 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.190
 both the yellow ones and the blue ones like 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.139
 the fifth essence have changed since 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.150
 the only valid yellows that had 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.160
 really they were the armor ones have 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.560
 said the armor loosen them a 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.330
 little and those of life and regeneration of 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.970
 life and we are going to increase them so that 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.669
 You can experiment with different things 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.620
 the blues have not changed but those of 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.539
 cooling give more cooling the 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.430
 magic resistance by level give a 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.340
 little bit more than mana regeneration 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.389
 same etcetera etcetera the quintessence 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.039
 basically more of the same the 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.990
 cooling reduction goes more 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.610
 cooling reduction the 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.710
 Attack speed gives more speed than 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.539
 attack and those that most had with a 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.729
 character of the physical year that were those of 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.020
 stealing life give a little less stealing 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.669
 of life so there is a little more 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.440
 variety and not only there are two or three 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.020
 that are better than the rest and with that 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.210
 after the changes in the moons the 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.070
 invoker spells a couple of changes 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.300
 in master's degrees that have not named the 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.389
 new objects 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.460
 I change the object in the armor 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:53.860
 reviews of champions and the changes of 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.020
 the champions you finished patch I 've 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.819
 explained everything I'm sweating I have the 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.710
 dry mouth and I'm going to go because I've 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:01.710
 stayed and this clothes does not take away from me alone
