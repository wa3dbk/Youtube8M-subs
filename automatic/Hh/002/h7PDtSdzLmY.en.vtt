00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:14.949 

I<00:00:11.690> think<00:00:12.690> Britain's<00:00:12.990> songs<00:00:13.260> are<00:00:13.500> very<00:00:13.530> um

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
I think Britain's songs are very um

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.140 
I think Britain's songs are very um
singular<00:00:15.959> in<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.470> they<00:00:16.699> they<00:00:17.699> stand<00:00:18.000> very

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
singular in that they they stand very

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.540 
singular in that they they stand very
firmly<00:00:18.510> within<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> German<00:00:20.689> leet<00:00:21.689> tradition

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
firmly within the German leet tradition

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.120 
firmly within the German leet tradition
I<00:00:23.550> mean<00:00:24.060> Britain<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.779> his<00:00:25.619> partner<00:00:25.980> Pete

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
I mean Britain and his partner Pete

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
I mean Britain and his partner Pete
appears<00:00:26.429> with<00:00:26.580> whom<00:00:26.699> he<00:00:26.869> performed<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
appears with whom he performed a lot and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.179 
appears with whom he performed a lot and
for<00:00:28.470> whom<00:00:28.589> he<00:00:28.710> wrote<00:00:28.949> his<00:00:29.189> songs<00:00:29.570> most<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> them

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
for whom he wrote his songs most of them

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
for whom he wrote his songs most of them
they<00:00:32.189> performed<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> lead

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
they performed a lot of the lead

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
they performed a lot of the lead
repertoire<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.500> performed<00:00:34.950> vinter<00:00:35.310> Heiser

a lot of Schubert songs shoe man evolved

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.570 
a lot of Schubert songs shoe man evolved
and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.180> think<00:00:39.770> Britain's<00:00:40.770> songs<00:00:41.040> come<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
and I think Britain's songs come out of

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.550 
and I think Britain's songs come out of
that<00:00:41.610> tradition<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> same<00:00:43.140> time<00:00:43.380> they

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
that tradition but at the same time they

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.550 
that tradition but at the same time they
are<00:00:43.650> also<00:00:43.830> setting<00:00:44.840> wonderful<00:00:45.840> English<00:00:46.760> texts

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
are also setting wonderful English texts

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.370 
are also setting wonderful English texts
not<00:00:49.560> easy<00:00:50.430> text<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.240> often<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:52.230> often

not easy text very often very often

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.310 
not easy text very often very often
unusual<00:00:53.100> texts<00:00:53.730> texts<00:00:54.630> which<00:00:54.810> one<00:00:55.020> barely

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
unusual texts texts which one barely

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.950

it was sort of in my in my blood in some
sort<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.690> way<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.870> think<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:44.140> know<00:01:45.140> there's

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
sort of way I think I know there's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.990 
sort of way I think I know there's
always<00:01:45.620> been<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.860> close<00:01:46.070> link<00:01:46.250> between<00:01:46.370> British

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
always been a close link between British

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.490 
always been a close link between British
life<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.390> Hamburg<00:01:47.720> life<00:01:47.930> because<00:01:48.260> of<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
life and Hamburg life because of the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.120 
life and Hamburg life because of the
merchant<00:01:49.250> class<00:01:49.790> in<00:01:50.090> in<00:01:50.360> Hamburg<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:51.200> think

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
merchant class in in Hamburg and I think

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.660 
merchant class in in Hamburg and I think
that's<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.480> also<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.050> seafaring<00:01:54.530> thing<00:01:54.890> in

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that's a and also the seafaring thing in

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.690 
that's a and also the seafaring thing in
Britain<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.150> very<00:01:56.480> much<00:01:56.810> he's<00:01:57.680> from<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.280> little

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
Britain is very much he's from a little

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.320 
Britain is very much he's from a little
a<00:01:59.000> little<00:01:59.690> rather<00:02:00.410> unglamorous<00:02:00.950> our<00:02:01.730> sea<00:02:02.120> town

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
a little rather unglamorous our sea town

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.610 
a little rather unglamorous our sea town
on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:03.140> english's<00:02:03.560> east<00:02:03.950> coast<00:02:04.360> lowestoft

on the english's east coast lowestoft

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.980 
on the english's east coast lowestoft
and<00:02:06.620> Hamburg<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.340> obviously<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.850> big<00:02:08.180> big

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and Hamburg is obviously the big big

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.410 
and Hamburg is obviously the big big
port<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.560> mural

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
