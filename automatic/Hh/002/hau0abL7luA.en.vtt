00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.220
 when moving the rock wet ground 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.590
 the road is better to use the top row 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.780
 transfer case block 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.550
 the differential is only up and down 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
 descents in other cases 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.640
 marking will only complicate handling 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.440
 chevrolet niva get under way and accelerate 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.440
 smoothly avoiding wheel spin 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.129
 try to move to fit without 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.129
 slip on possible high gear 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.040
 brake smoothly without locking the wheels 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.400
 combined with gear changes in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.400
 month 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.550
 broken road differential is better 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.950
 block as it appears 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.170
 possibility of significant unloading 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.450
 one of the wheels that can lead to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.450
 slip and reduce traction 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 so you're on a blurred road with 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.870
 track follow the scheme include 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.340
 reduced transfer case row and 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.340
 differential lock 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.460
 small areas run out better 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.200
 without turning rectilinear classic 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.370
 mode of movement reduced row 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.590
 transfer case 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.510
 second or third gear in the box 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.510
 gear and the smallest gas 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.759
 dynamic mode of movement alternation 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.189
 smooth addition of gas with its discharge 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.350
 allows you to grope how slippery 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.929
 ground move with a margin of speed and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 go through difficult areas when 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.609
 need to pave the way 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.859
 short throws using your rut 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.079
 front wheels should steer 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.869
 car on track or stay in 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.479
 position is straight and if it does not move with 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.280
 places anybody essentially better resort to 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.280
 help shovels and either
