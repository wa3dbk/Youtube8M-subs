homebrew gadget one of the problems we

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.360 
homebrew gadget one of the problems we
have<00:00:11.240> down<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:11.900> in<00:00:12.019> Southeast<00:00:12.530> Texas<00:00:12.889> in<00:00:13.280> the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
have down here in Southeast Texas in the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.790 
have down here in Southeast Texas in the
summertime<00:00:13.700> is<00:00:14.120> it's<00:00:14.719> very<00:00:14.929> difficult<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.650> get

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
summertime is it's very difficult to get

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.730 
summertime is it's very difficult to get
our<00:00:16.000> tap<00:00:17.000> water<00:00:17.029> down<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.200> low<00:00:18.470> enough

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
our tap water down to a low enough

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.010 
our tap water down to a low enough
temperature<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.340> run<00:00:20.180> through<00:00:20.390> our<00:00:20.449> chilling

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
temperature to run through our chilling

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.920 
temperature to run through our chilling
coil<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.680> get<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.920> warp<00:00:22.250> down<00:00:22.550> low<00:00:23.390> enough<00:00:23.539> so

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
coil to get the warp down low enough so

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.960 
coil to get the warp down low enough so
what<00:00:24.410> we're<00:00:24.560> going<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.949> do<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.220> basically<00:00:25.460> make

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
what we're going to do is basically make

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.500 
what we're going to do is basically make
a<00:00:26.240> pre<00:00:27.199> chiller<00:00:27.590> out<00:00:27.859> of<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.189> five-gallon<00:00:29.000> corny

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
a pre chiller out of a five-gallon corny

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.450 
a pre chiller out of a five-gallon corny
keg<00:00:29.779> we're<00:00:30.380> going<00:00:30.680> to<00:00:30.800> run<00:00:30.980> our<00:00:31.099> tap<00:00:31.430> water

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
keg we're going to run our tap water

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.939 
keg we're going to run our tap water
through<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.419> keg<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.989> then<00:00:33.470> through<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
through the keg and then through the

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.340 
through the keg and then through the
coils<00:00:34.400> and<00:00:34.750> hopefully<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:35.960> will<00:00:36.050> help<00:00:36.200> us

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
coils and hopefully that will help us

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.170 
coils and hopefully that will help us
bring<00:00:36.649> that<00:00:36.860> temperature<00:00:37.399> down<00:00:37.610> of<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.910> ward

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
bring that temperature down of the ward

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.780 
bring that temperature down of the ward

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.389 
temperature of the tap water and it's 90
degrees<00:00:47.500> here<00:00:48.500> are<00:00:48.620> some<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.860> parts<00:00:49.219> we're

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
degrees here are some of the parts we're

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.930 
degrees here are some of the parts we're
going<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.910> need<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:51.309> connect<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.399> water<00:00:52.670> hose

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
going to need to connect the water hose

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.439 
going to need to connect the water hose
to<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.480> keg<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:55.610> can<00:00:55.699> see<00:00:55.820> we've<00:00:56.000> got<00:00:56.030> several

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
to the keg you can see we've got several

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.290 
to the keg you can see we've got several
different<00:00:56.930> types<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.649> quick<00:00:58.219> disconnects<00:00:58.820> we

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
different types of quick disconnects we

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.090 
different types of quick disconnects we
also<00:00:59.510> have<00:00:59.690> fittings<00:01:00.260> for<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.620> water<00:01:00.829> hose

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
also have fittings for the water hose

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.090 
also have fittings for the water hose
and<00:01:01.520> some<00:01:01.760> clamps<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.390> I'm<00:01:02.870> using<00:01:03.170> three

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
and some clamps and I'm using three

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.260 
and some clamps and I'm using three
eighths<00:01:04.369> inch<00:01:04.960> braided<00:01:05.979> tubing<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.549> cut<00:01:08.060> into

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
eighths inch braided tubing I cut into

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.149 
eighths inch braided tubing I cut into
four<00:01:08.510> foot<00:01:08.780> lengths<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.500> we're<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.130> to

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
four foot lengths and we're going to

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.370 
four foot lengths and we're going to
connect<00:01:10.490> all<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.909> together<00:01:11.260> one<00:01:12.260> of<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
connect all that together one of the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.070 
connect all that together one of the
problems<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:12.799> have<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.330> connecting<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
problems we have is connecting the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.039 
problems we have is connecting the
three-eighths<00:01:15.830> inch<00:01:16.130> tubing<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.479> barbed

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
three-eighths inch tubing to a barbed

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.380 
three-eighths inch tubing to a barbed
fitting<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.770> quick<00:01:19.100> disconnect<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.210> a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
fitting on the quick disconnect it's a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.700 
fitting on the quick disconnect it's a
it's<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.720> little<00:01:20.930> large<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.439> barb

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's a little large for the barb

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.740 
it's a little large for the barb
disconnect<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.610> think<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:23.240> quarter

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
disconnect this is I think a quarter

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.440 
disconnect this is I think a quarter
inch<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.259> obviously<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.250> 38<00:01:25.729> so<00:01:26.330> it's

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
inch and obviously this is 38 so it's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.300 
inch and obviously this is 38 so it's
very<00:01:26.720> difficult<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.259> use<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.009> what<00:01:28.159> I've<00:01:28.280> done

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
very difficult to use so what I've done

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.810 
very difficult to use so what I've done
is<00:01:28.520> I've<00:01:28.759> taken<00:01:28.820> some<00:01:29.360> eighth<00:01:29.570> inch<00:01:30.820> tubing

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
is I've taken some eighth inch tubing

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.330 
is I've taken some eighth inch tubing
cut<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.720> put<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.290> on<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.590> barbed<00:01:33.860> fittings

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
cut it and put it on the barbed fittings

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.050 
cut it and put it on the barbed fittings
to<00:01:34.820> give<00:01:34.970> me<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.180> little<00:01:35.450> bit<00:01:35.630> more<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:37.100> guess

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
to give me a little bit more I guess

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.780 
to give me a little bit more I guess
meet<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:38.900> bar<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.979> i<00:01:40.009> can<00:01:40.310> connect<00:01:40.640> them

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
meet to this bar so i can connect them

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.670 
meet to this bar so i can connect them
together<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.900> first<00:01:42.079> thing<00:01:42.170> I'm<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.590> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
together so the first thing I'm going to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.460 
together so the first thing I'm going to
do<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.659> put<00:01:44.810> my<00:01:46.780> hose<00:01:47.780> clamp<00:01:48.200> on

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
do is I'm going to put my hose clamp on

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.109 
do is I'm going to put my hose clamp on
there<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:51.530> should<00:01:51.740> connect<00:01:52.159> rather

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
there and that should connect rather

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
there and that should connect rather
easily<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:53.990> end<00:01:55.450> you'll<00:01:56.450> see

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850 

you<00:02:06.070> can<00:02:06.280> see<00:02:06.400> that's<00:02:06.610> connected<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.180> there

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you can see that's connected on there

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.930 
you can see that's connected on there
now<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.040> I've<00:02:09.160> got<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.430> connected<00:02:09.820> all

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
now that I've got it connected all

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.960 
now that I've got it connected all

connectors they just go on basically the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.610
