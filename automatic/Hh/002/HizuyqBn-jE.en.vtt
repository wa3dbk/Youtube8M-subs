00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.290
 i a good designer is a factory 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.719
 ideas and freedom with dash to release 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.179
 hand and light these ideas is the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.779
 differentiate experienced art from a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.090
 beginner 's real presence may have 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.099
 an idea at any time 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.599
 I felt a compelling need to 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.119
 put that on paper 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.550
 and this is where the material comes into play 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 more fun and personalized from a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 artist a sketchbook the translation for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.830
 sketchbook would be sketchbook 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.930
 but I do not take meaning from the letter 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.900
 way I would call it a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.990
 free drawings ie without drawing 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.670
 commitment to free 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.950
 It was then that you give me the tile at the moment. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.770
 a drawing has the habit of walking with a 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.710
 of them all the time and always 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.160
 when you see a gap sketchbook bag and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 they send the drawing there are no rules and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 standards for sketchbooks there are people 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.039
 which are large and other notebooks 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.899
 small 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.049
 I particularly like the little ones. 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.270
 because they are easier to carry 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 handle and fit in any pocket 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 notebooks in question serves but not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.810
 always what is in stationery 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 has a good role to play for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.100
 some use very thin sheets or 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.420
 wimps that will rip or erase the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.890
 back page 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 You can buy a notebook that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 find it cool or make your own 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.679
 sketchbook and there's a suggestion that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.810
 you can do yourself at home I will 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.399
 model with the easiest model 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.859
 so that anyone can have their 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.060
 value for the island closest to your home 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.960
 and bought a block of sulphite paper a4 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.400
 90 grams 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 but attention grab the 90 grams existed from 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.520
 75 but this one for drawing is very thin 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.850
 separates around a light 30 leaves 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.920
 on the nearest printer or copier 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 piece to cut the leaves in four 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.229
 equal parts 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.540
 so the 30 sheets became 120 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.000
 this one then playing with nothing else puts 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.730
 spiral at one of the smaller ends 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.190
 to take better advantage of the role and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.000
 You have a little book and 120 pages 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.580
 for drawing 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.650
 if you want to find you can buy 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.769
 a thicker sheet of paper had a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.989
 card or triplex and I will use the car 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 looking so he looks pretty dull 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.760
 not 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.840
 But that's where the fun begins. 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.360
 customizing sketchbooks is one of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.360
 More Fun Stuff process or 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 on the cover the verse in all places that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.819
 have the right idea is that you draw 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.709
 uncompromised and simply let 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.430
 flow has drawings that have become more 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.400
 cool 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 others not so much and when they will get bad 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.680
 you just turn the page and start 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.680
 another does not rip the pages of your 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.010
 sketchbook save all drawings and 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.110
 Incomprehensible scribblings also make 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.850
 part of the creation process 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.860
 you can then draw in any 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.380
 place and this gives a very 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.049
 great with the passage of time to seek 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.450
 become as natural as walking. 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.250
 there are still several types of paper 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 that you can switch to use in the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.060
 Knee Your Skate Book Like Pollen Art 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.920
 Marrakesh tired you. 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.769
 each has a different characteristic 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.989
 and you can ride one to your liking yet 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.600
 we'll talk more paper goals and 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
 your chances ok for the comments 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.739
 I know that many people find it difficult to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 find drawing materials know 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.329
 that we are working out a way to 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.880

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.290
