00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello dear friends we are in 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.209
 store base and in front of us is brand new 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.010
 fresh technics player on 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.449
 an example of which I will show how to 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.600
 tune dj needles 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.690
 scratching 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.830
 and just listening here this detail 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.739
 this is called the complete arm assembly 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.550
 this thing this is called an arrow 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.149
 tonearm she's from here to here right 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.899
 arrow 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:44.079
 right tonearm attached here hit show 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.379
 with a needle cartridge on the other side 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.250
 counterweight mounted rotating weight 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.370
 which the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:58.180
 loads or weakens 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 system load this is called a clip 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.090
 or latch for fixing tonearm here it is 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.990
 lift foot that allows you to lift 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.799
 and lower smoothly the arm if we 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.039
 use expensive needles and are not sure 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:25.060
 the strength of our hands also we have great 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.979
 the system for raising the arm 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.279
 height depending on the height of the cartridge 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.669
 with the vast majority of cases 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:40.539
 DJ needles need to be installed on 

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:44.560
 0 for example, take the standard wanted 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.310
 technics with standard jim map 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.939
 and needle 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.039
 also technics is a rare guest in our 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.659
 latitudes but nonetheless it is 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:59.289
 standard for technics players 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:04.869
 very simple fixing system 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:09.399
 bayan it well and insert the end into the groove 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.569
 Hyjal and quite tight but surely 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.650
 without fanaticism 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:18.879
 we twist it to the limit and now our 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.150
 the main task is to catch zero 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.150
 position 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.269
 tonearm is he the balance we have now 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.269
 bully tonearm need him a little 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.269
 to load 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:55.420
 now the hole is parallel it is not loaded 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:58.960
 and not overloaded if we pay attention 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 then our counterweight consists of two 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.500
 details the first part is the load with 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.700
 rubber grip and whatever 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.130
 spinning risk display 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.520
 when we caught zero position us 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:24.490
 you need to put the number 0 on 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:29.070
 at risk of an arrow tonarm so we noted 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.650
 provisions but usually in the passport needles 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.280
 indicates the nominal pressure on the needle 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.130
 when the needle is new but usually in the process 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.790
 games and the chapter is sewn it has to 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.220
 load a little assume that 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 our needle requires a load of two s 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:56.140
 half gram turn clockwise 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.970
 arrow 1 gram and a half two two s 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.660
 by half 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.400
 that's for sure and the division and our needle on 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.820
 currently loaded for two s 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.290
 half a gram if we are only 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.060
 play records 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.030
 do backspin and hide or just 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.370
 study is very important for us 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:24.730
 on this whaling which should 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:28.030
 being in zero why in on us not 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.640
 need a compensating power because we 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.630
 it is important that the needle did not try 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.550
 jump from one track to another 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:42.870
 so we always set to 0 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.870
 often when we use 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:52.780
 for example needle system 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.819
 concord or suppose classic 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.759
 needles shu-ta 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:01.750
 our tonearm height is always on 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.169
 zero on this whipping is also on 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.889
 nol 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:10.900
 but if we shoot a dj corner 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.599
 which is meant for exactly 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.599
 dj use and set 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:24.160
 Needle suppose for listening 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.849
 haifa and records and we just want not from 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.889
 don't spoil the record then we 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:35.099
 have to do a little different 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:38.169
 manipulations we have to re-look 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:42.759
 zero mark because all needles 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:47.340
 have different weight and see i set on 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.340
 mark zero as a ride up and club 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.279
 now 0 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:14.750
 don't forget to put at risk the display with 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.800
 zero and load up to 2 grams for this 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.700
 needles 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.440
 load of 2 grams is necessary but we are 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.960
 we are not going to play on it 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.590
 going to listen to her how to be santa 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.560
 skating 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.230
 on this heating we set exactly 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.170
 in proportion to the load, that is, if 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.920
 us load 2 grams the rescue on 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.570
 on this kiting display we turn 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:48.190
 by division 2 and if we assume 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:51.530
 load not required 218 then we become 18 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:57.050
 if load is required one and a half 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.290
 we put a half it's all easy 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:05.120
 remember and understand the main thing to understand 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.870
 process and essence of things when using 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.700
 hi fi 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:14.320
 needles are recommended to use the elevator 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:21.160
 because with him it is easier to put and 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.160
 put the needle on the desired track
