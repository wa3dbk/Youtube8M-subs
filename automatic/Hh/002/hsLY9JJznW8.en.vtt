00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, and we continue to do 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 our strategy and today we will deal with those 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.429
 that we are going so that on these units 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.540
 Couldn't merge like this 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.950
 see right now 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.599
 and today we will do so for us 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 each unit and the sky its amount 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 lives and also a million so that when 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.449
 we will encircle them here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.210
 there were such crumbs 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.100
 well then let's start the first thing we 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 do it so that they can not 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.150
 so here we merge for this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.540
 go to settings 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.780
 we are going to take such an event 6 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.780
 touches 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.739
 sprite 6 then our will collect 6 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.030
 avoid sprite 6 meaning we are here 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.700
 choose this one to avoid this sprite 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.110
 so avoid this object here too 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.899
 choose to collect 6 and the sense that we have from 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 this happened we can enter 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.590
 point to one point and that's what's here 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.229
 they do not merge with us as merged to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.040
 This is a very good thing. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.049
 with us they drown touch each other 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.670
 up to a friend but if it is played like they are so 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.400
 touch you can do so 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.509
 so that they would not merge at all 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.960
 we have to choose here this is not here 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.420
 also remove nastrat 6 and see here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 as you can see they are not filmed at all 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 so not at all the terrace is not quite so 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.900
 bad not so not nice so here I am 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 I put it so that one each other 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:44.460
 be avoided as well, like this review 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 OK well, that are now going so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 each strike had its quantity 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 lives and here from above we would have 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 sprite that will show 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 the number of lives of our here these 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 units 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.820
 well let's start for this we must 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.710
 let's add this red 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.590
 sprite just make red straight 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:15.510
 we reduce to the necessary sizes well we admit 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:19.680
 Here such here and carry on 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.100
 layer 3 is valid but before proceeding 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.380
 events we will have to add more 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.530
 our life in a container in a container with 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.770
 object 56 if you click on our 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 interior go to a construction container container 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.600
 make sure now our sprite 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.510
 totally tied to ours 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.269
 life well now let's continue 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.620
 destroy our lives imagine that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.459
 there is in the attributes we put here 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.700
 tick to start or at us 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.450
 destroyed and make such an event 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:02.340
 if we beat them 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:06.350
 i.e. the choice is 1 then our spray 24 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.350
 that is, our life becomes visible and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.130
 if choice 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.980
 equals 0 that is, if we clicked on 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.799
 grass mouse button then our lives 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.230
 become invisible and let's tie 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.540
 our lives to our main character for 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:29.340
 this make such an event is always ours 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.739
 life determines its position here 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.620
 write the coordinates of our units that is 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:42.560
 six define x 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:50.239
 well let's say we write -10 here and 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.239
 we define and y only here we write y 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.439
 and see what we did it 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.269
 now so you see our units have 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.379
 lives that are a little crooked 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.379
 let 's fix it 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.430
 Well, what I am now, our here these 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.970
 lines are attached to our units and now 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.560
 they are not going anywhere 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.210
 well life we ​​will start doing next 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.470
 lesson and now we go so that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.190
 so that when we introduce our 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.639
 units then we appeared here 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.940
 such here 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.069
 pass such here circles around them this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.960
 we will allow and their radius of action 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.780
 let's say if someone enters this circle 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.789
 then they will attack them well let's say 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.199
 for this we will have to do such 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:02.759
 here's a sprite 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:09.680
 let's say green and puts the center 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.680
 midpoint radius we will have this 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.099
 you can change this size 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.919
 add this sprite to our container 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.919
 units and made exactly the same events 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:36.270
 so and we go such events are always ours 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:42.900
 This circle of ours had a position on 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:45.210
 sprite 6 action movies bx only here 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.469
 remove -10 and see what we have from this 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.509
 it turned out that's how you see well let's 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.699
 do so that our sprites be 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.569
 would be visible if we chose these sprites 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.919
 we go this way 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:05.930
 if you choose this sprite then these 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.930
 green circles become visible 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.310
 become visible and if we don’t 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.969
 chose then our circle becomes 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.969
 invisible 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:21.430
 and see what we have out of this why so 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.880
 we lead somewhere we send 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.820
 units and see what we have our circles 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.080
 appeared in life also appeared 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.290
 click on the right mouse button we have them 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.600
 no so my now chose us not yet 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.120
 sent closet our cats will not appear 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.010
 so she want to make them with us 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.770
 you appeared immediately when we choose 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:48.610
 our units here so I clean the toys 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:55.270
 appeared the same thing we have to do 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:58.270
 and life so well, that's where I am now 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.850
 I turn on the game, they are mine and therefore 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.240
 I can even send them from the election 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.850
 I won't do it anywhere 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:10.750
 so here's how you see we have it all 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.880
 it works correctly can be done 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.240
 these pebbles are more invisible and 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.410
 make m more big well are we waiting 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.810
 in the next lesson 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.640
 well and on this i think mouth we will finish 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.530
