00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 the iphone 5 is thinner lighter and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.500
 globally better equipped than the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.900
 previous model 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 apple has also slightly revised the design 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 of his smartphone with a particular 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.060
 bigger screen 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 but deserves all the attention 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.490
 brings him first impressions before 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.560
 our laboratory laboratory generation 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 after generation the iphone has lengthened 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 and refined this time he loses 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.510
 also a few grams and suddenly done 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.579
 a little less bricks when you hold it 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.200
 in hand for the first time apple 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 changes the size of the screen and adopts a 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 format 16 9th the diagonal goes to 4 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.340
 inch instead of 3.5 visual comfort 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.780
 is necessarily affected but the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.070
 developers must now adapt 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.379
 their applications otherwise they 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 appear with black stripes 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.710
 apple chose not to expand his 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 smartphone for he explains he 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 remains easily manipulated with a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 only one hand this argument aims to counter 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 samsung and its galaxy s iii that is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 certainly wider but whose screen is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 still significantly larger the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 most notable change comes from the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.360
 connector since 2003 apple was using 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 the same 30-pin connector become there 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.650
 is true too bulky apple has it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.869
 greatly reduced but instead 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 to adopt the standard micro usb as 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.280
 his competitors he developed his 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 own lightning format so agree 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.159
 it is reversible 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 no more need to look for common sense for 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 connect the cable but you have to buy 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.890
 an adapter to continue using 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 its docking station where its charger 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 cigar lighter a mercantile attitude 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.540
 not really very fair play for 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.640
 apple customers 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 once lit no major change 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.570
 regarding the interface the overall look 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.130
 is by the way the same since all 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
 first iphone in 2007 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 we could almost blame him for being 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 a little aging especially when we 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.860
 see what microsoft is preparing with its 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.960
 windows phone interface 8 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.370
 a little graphical facelift and some 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 functions still improves 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.910
 the new version of the system 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.710
 operating ios the mailbox 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.450
 for example, group all messages 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.940
 with flags and new options 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.440
 manage an incoming call on 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.060
 can also post directly 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.700
 messages on social networks since 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.530
 the notification center in bones 6 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 apple is also happening services 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.330
 google maps it is backed by tomtom 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.520
 to propose his own cards the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 location and fast and accurate and 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.060
 we can visualize a route in 3d 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.160
 option that is not 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.720
 available everywhere but this news 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
 home application is for now 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.170
 very much criticized by the first 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.300
 apple users also incorporates a 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.950
 road navigation solution that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.950
 can do without a car gps 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.350
 the photo sensor do not evolve but the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.870
 delay between two shots was 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.489
 greatly shortened the device 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.030
 also has a pretty panorama mode 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.030
 convincing 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 apple also promises that the voice assistant 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.360
 siri has been improved and offers 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 the application goes to collect book 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.959
 in the same folder coupons of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.760
 discount or airline tickets in 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.860
 the absence of a difficult partner for 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.209
 the moment to evaluate this function for 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.740
 that navigation is fluid 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.630
 apple to equip the iphone 5 with a 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.910
 new generation of processors the a6 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 our lab tests will evaluate its 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.690
 real performances we will also see if 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.480
 the sound quality has been improved as 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.190
 the Apple promises to summarize the iphone 5 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.020
 offers a good camera and some 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.250
 new functions but there nothing 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.720
 revolutionary 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.820
 remains to be seen if it will allow apple to 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.820
 regain his place of number 1 in our 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.500
 ranking for the moment samsung galaxy 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.500
 s iii are firmly installed
