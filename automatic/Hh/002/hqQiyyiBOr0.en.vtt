00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
guess they have to call them for the
rear<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.760> you're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.539> assemble

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
rear and then you're going to assemble

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.310 
rear and then you're going to assemble
up<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.070> rear<00:00:26.640> hubs<00:00:26.970> let<00:00:27.390> me<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.570> ahead<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.990> get

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
up the rear hubs let me go ahead and get

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.150 
up the rear hubs let me go ahead and get
started<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.789> CBA<00:00:30.179> assembly<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
started on that the CBA assembly is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.260 
started on that the CBA assembly is
pretty<00:00:32.160> much<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:32.910> expect

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty much just what you would expect

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
pretty much just what you would expect
nothing<00:00:33.660> special<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> standard<00:00:35.550> way

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
nothing special there the standard way

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.100 
nothing special there the standard way
of<00:00:35.760> putting<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:36.360> together<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.840> we've

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of putting those together that we've

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
of putting those together that we've
seen<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.620> many<00:00:37.890> many<00:00:38.280> many<00:00:38.520> years<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
seen for many many many years and the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
seen for many many many years and the
rear<00:00:39.690> hub<00:00:39.930> carriers<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.590> super<00:00:41.280> super

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
rear hub carriers are super super

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
rear hub carriers are super super
heavy-duty<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.629> things<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.200> thick

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
heavy-duty these things are thick

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
heavy-duty these things are thick
they're<00:00:44.610> also<00:00:44.789> fairly<00:00:45.629> small<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
they're also fairly small so all the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
they're also fairly small so all the
material<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> compacted<00:00:48.390> into<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> small<00:00:49.140> area

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
material is compacted into a small area

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.220 
material is compacted into a small area
and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.730> five<00:00:51.090> by<00:00:51.300> ten<00:00:51.629> bearings

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and then they use five by ten bearings

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.979 
and then they use five by ten bearings
five<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.250> ten<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.850> bearings<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
five by ten but for bearings on the

five by ten but for bearings on the
inside<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.640> crush<00:00:57.059> spacer<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
inside you have a little crush spacer in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to be able to take so much force I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
going to be able to take so much force I
mean<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> largest<00:01:09.780> outer<00:01:10.710> bushing<00:01:11.400> or

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
mean that's the largest outer bushing or

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
mean that's the largest outer bushing or
outer<00:01:12.119> bearing<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> I've<00:01:12.810> seen<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.350> any

that large on the inside large on the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
that large on the inside large on the
outer<00:01:20.970> diameter<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.290> never<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that thick in these hubs so that is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
that thick in these hubs so that is
definitely<00:01:26.430> designed<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.570> maximum

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
definitely designed for maximum

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.039

durability<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.159> taken<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.759> big<00:01:29.790> hits<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
durability and taken some big hits so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.340

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
big ups to low C for going above and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
big ups to low C for going above and
beyond<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> strength<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
beyond with the strength there because

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
beyond with the strength there because
we<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:37.079> buggies<00:01:37.970> something

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
we all know that on buggies something

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
we all know that on buggies something
that's<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.479> common<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.439> bad<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.740> these

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that's very common to go bad on these

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's very common to go bad on these
things<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.729> anything<00:01:42.689> towards<00:01:43.140> the

things would be anything towards the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
all those kinds of things I don't think

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
all those kinds of things I don't think
you're<00:01:52.110> gonna<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> lot<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.100> braking

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you're gonna see a lot of these braking

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
you're gonna see a lot of these braking
now<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> first<00:01:54.600> assembled<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> axles

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
now when I first assembled the axles

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.389 
now when I first assembled the axles
into<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> hub<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.740> immediately<00:01:58.740> felt<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
into the hub I immediately felt the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.499 
into the hub I immediately felt the
tell-tale<00:02:00.240> signs<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:02.180> bearing<00:02:03.180> being

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
tell-tale signs of a bearing being

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.859 
tell-tale signs of a bearing being
crushed<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> could<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.280> feel<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
crushed or you could actually feel the a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.809 
crushed or you could actually feel the a
little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.700> wobble<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:09.030> there

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
little bit of wobble in there

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.479 
little bit of wobble in there
the<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.899> balls<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.799> ball<00:02:11.980> jointer

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the the balls in the ball jointer

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.479

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
in as far as it will go push it in with

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.220 
in as far as it will go push it in with
a<00:02:34.090> little<00:02:34.180> bit<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.510> force<00:02:34.810> when<00:02:35.109> you're

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
a little bit of force when you're

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190 
a little bit of force when you're
initially<00:02:35.650> inserting<00:02:36.189> it<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.659> one<00:02:37.959> side

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
initially inserting it on on one side

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.280 
initially inserting it on on one side
that<00:02:38.530> gave<00:02:38.769> me<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.219> nice<00:02:39.579> smooth<00:02:40.150> feel<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that gave me a nice smooth feel on the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
that gave me a nice smooth feel on the
other<00:02:41.439> side<00:02:41.680> even<00:02:41.859> after<00:02:42.220> pushing<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.639> in<00:02:42.760> all

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
other side even after pushing it in all

other side even after pushing it in all
the<00:02:43.209> way<00:02:43.359> I<00:02:43.389> still<00:02:43.930> had<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.680> lot<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.280> tightness

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
the way I still had a lot of tightness

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.250 
the way I still had a lot of tightness
in<00:02:45.939> there<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.299> was<00:02:46.450> not<00:02:46.689> comfortable<00:02:47.109> with

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
in there and it was not comfortable with

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.990 
in there and it was not comfortable with
it<00:02:47.409> at<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.919> took<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.459> whole<00:02:48.549> thing<00:02:48.609> back

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it at all I took the whole thing back

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.629 
it at all I took the whole thing back
apart<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:49.540> actually<00:02:49.629> just<00:02:50.019> very<00:02:50.859> very<00:02:51.099> very

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
apart and actually just very very very

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.289 
apart and actually just very very very
ever<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.720> lightly<00:02:53.010> Dremel<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.340> slight<00:02:54.849> bit

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
ever so lightly Dremel just a slight bit

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.569 
ever so lightly Dremel just a slight bit

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
outer bearing seats in so that they

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.640 
outer bearing seats in so that they
could<00:03:00.609> go<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.419> slight<00:03:01.870> bit<00:03:02.139> more<00:03:02.379> just

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
could go in just a slight bit more just

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.539 
could go in just a slight bit more just
a<00:03:02.769> tiniest<00:03:03.549> fraction<00:03:03.909> of<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.269> millimeter

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
a tiniest fraction of a millimeter

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.190 
a tiniest fraction of a millimeter
probably<00:03:06.549> Oh<00:03:06.879> point<00:03:07.209> one<00:03:07.269> point<00:03:07.959> two

probably Oh point one point two

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.909 
probably Oh point one point two
millimeters<00:03:08.799> at<00:03:09.430> most<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:11.349> now<00:03:11.620> that's

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
millimeters at most and now that's

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.189 
millimeters at most and now that's
actually<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.730> lot<00:03:13.120> smoother<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.049> can

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
actually a lot smoother and it can

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.170 
actually a lot smoother and it can
actually<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:15.190> rotate<00:03:15.579> freely<00:03:15.879> without

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
actually just rotate freely without

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
there being play back and forth I mean I

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.409 
there being play back and forth I mean I
can<00:03:18.879> feel<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:20.560> very<00:03:20.979> slightest<00:03:21.819> amount

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
can feel just the very slightest amount

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.170 
can feel just the very slightest amount

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
of play barely if I really pay attention

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.719 
of play barely if I really pay attention
to<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.870> lot<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.680> watch<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.609> and

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
to it a lot so watch out for that and

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.360 
to it a lot so watch out for that and
make<00:03:27.879> sure<00:03:27.909> that<00:03:28.209> when<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.449> assemble<00:03:28.750> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
make sure that when you assemble this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.020 
make sure that when you assemble this
the<00:03:30.370> rear<00:03:30.639> hubs<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.120> don't<00:03:31.449> have<00:03:31.720> an

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
if it doesn't feel smooth then you're

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.879

everything<00:04:32.650> goes<00:04:32.830> together<00:04:33.070> pretty<00:04:33.490> well<00:04:33.760> but

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
everything goes together pretty well but

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.380 
everything goes together pretty well but
there<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.570> one<00:04:34.960> little<00:04:35.200> detail<00:04:35.560> here<00:04:36.300> in<00:04:37.300> the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
there is one little detail here in the

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.980 
there is one little detail here in the
form<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:38.020> tiny<00:04:38.740> tiny<00:04:39.100> screw<00:04:39.580> which<00:04:39.910> is

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
form of this tiny tiny screw which is

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.750 
form of this tiny tiny screw which is
pretty<00:04:40.990> much<00:04:41.140> just<00:04:41.830> used<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.370> hold<00:04:42.580> things

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
pretty much just used to hold things

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.990 
pretty much just used to hold things
together<00:04:43.470> while<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.950> go<00:04:45.160> off<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.370> do<00:04:45.760> other

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
together while you go off and do other

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.440 
together while you go off and do other
steps<00:04:46.600> it's<00:04:46.930> just<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.260> keep<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.890> whole<00:04:48.450> rear

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
steps it's just to keep the whole rear

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.410 
steps it's just to keep the whole rear
clip<00:04:49.990> from<00:04:50.290> falling<00:04:50.830> off<00:04:51.010> as<00:04:51.910> you<00:04:52.090> do<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
clip from falling off as you do the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.260 
clip from falling off as you do the
transmission<00:04:53.020> at<00:04:53.110> all<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.790> problem<00:04:55.150> is

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
transmission at all and the problem is

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.470 
transmission at all and the problem is
that<00:04:55.480> I<00:04:55.720> don't<00:04:56.440> know<00:04:56.560> how<00:04:56.740> large<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.550> hex

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
that I don't know how large that hex

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.810 
that I don't know how large that hex
head<00:04:58.750> is<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.650> it's<00:04:59.770> tiny<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.370> it's<00:05:00.490> smaller

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
head is but it's tiny and it's smaller

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.000 
head is but it's tiny and it's smaller
than<00:05:00.940> anything<00:05:01.510> that<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.720> had<00:05:02.020> as<00:05:02.560> far<00:05:02.770> as<00:05:02.920> a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
than anything that I had as far as a

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.570 
than anything that I had as far as a
driver<00:05:03.340> is<00:05:03.610> concerned<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.920> just<00:05:05.920> watch<00:05:06.370> out

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
driver is concerned so just watch out

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.220 
driver is concerned so just watch out
for<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.880> I<00:05:06.940> ended<00:05:07.300> up<00:05:07.420> using<00:05:07.600> fortunately

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
for that I ended up using fortunately

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.170 
for that I ended up using fortunately
like<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.470> said<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:08.770> not<00:05:08.980> a<00:05:09.180> structural

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
like I said it's not a structural

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.070 
like I said it's not a structural
component<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.900> ended<00:05:11.470> up<00:05:11.560> using<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:13.450> very

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
component I ended up using a a very

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.650 
component I ended up using a a very
small<00:05:14.590> jeweler's<00:05:15.630> flat-head<00:05:16.630> screwdriver

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
small jeweler's flat-head screwdriver

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.710 
small jeweler's flat-head screwdriver
that<00:05:17.560> just<00:05:17.830> fit<00:05:18.130> across<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.480> was<00:05:19.630> able

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
that just fit across it and I was able

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.780 
that just fit across it and I was able
to<00:05:19.870> tighten<00:05:20.230> it<00:05:20.320> down<00:05:20.350> enough<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.340> used<00:05:21.670> a

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
to tighten it down enough and I used a

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.670 
to tighten it down enough and I used a
little<00:05:21.970> bit<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.210> Loctite<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:23.110> make<00:05:23.410> sure<00:05:23.560> it

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
little bit of Loctite to make sure it

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.910 
little bit of Loctite to make sure it
doesn't<00:05:23.860> fall<00:05:24.430> out<00:05:24.460> but<00:05:25.150> man<00:05:26.140> what<00:05:26.710> were<00:05:26.800> they

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
doesn't fall out but man what were they

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.380 
doesn't fall out but man what were they
thinking<00:05:29.280> there's<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.370> rear<00:05:30.700> assembly<00:05:30.940> coming

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
thinking there's a rear assembly coming

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.390 
thinking there's a rear assembly coming
together<00:05:31.480> a<00:05:31.690> little<00:05:32.050> bit<00:05:32.170> more<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
together a little bit more this is the

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.990 
together a little bit more this is the
back<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.660> battery<00:05:35.200> box<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.490> battery<00:05:36.760> tray

back of the battery box the battery tray
so<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.360> speak<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.620> also<00:05:38.770> has<00:05:38.980> a<00:05:39.010> little<00:05:39.280> bit

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
so to speak and it also has a little bit

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.060 
so to speak and it also has a little bit
of<00:05:39.570> bracing<00:05:40.570> so<00:05:40.810> that's<00:05:41.140> going<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.590> ultimately

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
of bracing so that's going to ultimately

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.830 
of bracing so that's going to ultimately
help<00:05:43.200> deal<00:05:44.200> with<00:05:44.230> strains<00:05:45.040> from<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.840> shock

wide horizontal base to it and gives it
enough<00:06:08.890> enough<00:06:09.460> bracing<00:06:09.940> because<00:06:10.090> it<00:06:10.150> has<00:06:10.270> a

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
enough enough bracing because it has a
