now I'm going to show you how to place
in<00:00:20.690> some<00:00:20.990> distant<00:00:21.440> mountains<00:00:22.240> using<00:00:23.240> a

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
in some distant mountains using a

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.260 
in some distant mountains using a
one-inch<00:00:23.930> landscape<00:00:24.560> brush<00:00:24.910> I've<00:00:25.910> already

one-inch landscape brush I've already
placed<00:00:26.540> in<00:00:26.780> a<00:00:26.900> sky<00:00:27.440> with<00:00:27.830> adding<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.760> little<00:00:28.910> bit

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
placed in a sky with adding a little bit

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.470 
placed in a sky with adding a little bit
of<00:00:29.180> blue<00:00:29.450> and<00:00:29.600> black<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.170> some<00:00:30.620> white<00:00:31.480> one

of blue and black and some white one
thing<00:00:32.660> about<00:00:32.840> mountains<00:00:33.380> are<00:00:33.650> there<00:00:34.100> are<00:00:34.160> so

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
thing about mountains are there are so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.770 
thing about mountains are there are so
many<00:00:34.430> different<00:00:34.910> mountains<00:00:35.239> out<00:00:35.420> there<00:00:35.660> you

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
many different mountains out there you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.560 
many different mountains out there you
can't<00:00:36.020> do<00:00:36.170> anything<00:00:36.410> wrong<00:00:36.710> with<00:00:36.950> creating

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
can't do anything wrong with creating

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.090 
can't do anything wrong with creating
you<00:00:38.570> know<00:00:38.690> any<00:00:38.900> shape<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.440> put<00:00:39.770> on<00:00:39.920> your

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
you know any shape that you put on your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.940 
you know any shape that you put on your
canvas<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.180> going<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.450> look<00:00:41.630> like<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:42.320> beautiful

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
canvas is going to look like a beautiful

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.280 
canvas is going to look like a beautiful
mountain<00:00:43.130> in<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> background<00:00:44.090> as<00:00:44.750> long<00:00:45.080> as

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
mountain in the background as long as

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.200 
mountain in the background as long as
the<00:00:45.440> color<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.980> similar<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.790> color<00:00:47.059> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
the color is similar to the color a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.329 
the color is similar to the color a
little<00:00:47.360> bit<00:00:47.540> darker<00:00:48.170> or<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:49.040> could<00:00:49.190> be<00:00:49.309> a

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
little bit darker or it could be a

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.430 
little bit darker or it could be a
little<00:00:49.550> bit<00:00:49.760> lighter<00:00:50.030> than<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.629> value<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
little bit lighter than the value of the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.490 
little bit lighter than the value of the
sky<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:52.100> you're<00:00:52.339> placing<00:00:52.940> on<00:00:53.059> top<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.660> you're

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
sky that you're placing on top of you're

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.600 
sky that you're placing on top of you're
doing<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:54.949> fine<00:00:55.070> now<00:00:55.640> I'm<00:00:55.940> angling<00:00:56.870> my<00:00:57.199> brush

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
doing just fine now I'm angling my brush

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.899 
doing just fine now I'm angling my brush
so<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.670> can<00:00:59.120> start<00:00:59.720> at<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.900> diagonal<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.949> wiggle

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
so I can start at a diagonal and wiggle

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.340 
so I can start at a diagonal and wiggle
or<00:01:02.210> move<00:01:02.750> my<00:01:02.780> arm<00:01:03.500> up<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:04.040> down<00:01:04.129> as<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:06.080> come

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
or move my arm up and down as I come

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.430 
or move my arm up and down as I come
over<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.510> left<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:09.680> raising<00:01:10.130> my<00:01:10.880> arm<00:01:11.510> to

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
over to the left I'm raising my arm to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.969 
over to the left I'm raising my arm to
create<00:01:12.800> different<00:01:13.100> Peaks<00:01:14.680> different<00:01:15.680> heights

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
create different Peaks different heights

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.200 
create different Peaks different heights
of<00:01:16.400> Peaks

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.150 

now<00:01:20.210> usually<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.960> mountains<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
now usually the mountains in the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.380 
now usually the mountains in the
distance<00:01:23.830> take<00:01:24.830> on<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.400> beautiful<00:01:26.030> sky

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
distance take on the beautiful sky

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.170 
distance take on the beautiful sky
colors<00:01:26.980> that's<00:01:27.980> why<00:01:28.190> they<00:01:28.370> look<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.760> far<00:01:29.030> away

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
colors that's why they look so far away

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.870 
colors that's why they look so far away
now<00:01:29.630> once<00:01:30.530> I've<00:01:30.770> created<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.430> different

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
now once I've created the different

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.260 
now once I've created the different
heights<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.630> Peaks<00:01:33.760> different<00:01:34.760> widths

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
heights of Peaks different widths

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.680 
heights of Peaks different widths
between<00:01:35.900> them<00:01:36.530> I<00:01:36.770> know<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.300> going<00:01:38.600> to

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
between them I know that it's going to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.930 
between them I know that it's going to
look<00:01:38.870> natural<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.620> all<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.070> doing<00:01:40.460> now<00:01:40.670> is

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
look natural and all I'm doing now is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.900 
look natural and all I'm doing now is
just<00:01:41.150> blending<00:01:41.890> going<00:01:42.890> from<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.310> bottom<00:01:43.520> of

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
just blending going from the bottom of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.100 
just blending going from the bottom of
my<00:01:43.940> shape<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.700> side-to-side<00:01:46.810> strokes<00:01:47.810> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
my shape and side-to-side strokes to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.380 
my shape and side-to-side strokes to
blend<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.590> sky<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:56.210> whether

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
blend it in to the sky and whether

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.540 
blend it in to the sky and whether
you're<00:01:56.600> left<00:01:56.870> or<00:01:57.080> right-handed<00:01:57.770> because<00:01:58.400> I'm

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're left or right-handed because I'm

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.750 
you're left or right-handed because I'm
right-handed<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:59.240> go<00:02:00.190> because<00:02:01.190> I'm<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.580> far

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
right-handed I go because I'm so far

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.930 
right-handed I go because I'm so far
left<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.450> all<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.260> can<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.980> I'm<00:02:04.280> going

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
left it all you can see this I'm going

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.440 
left it all you can see this I'm going
from<00:02:05.150> right<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.390> left<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.790> doesn't<00:02:08.239> matter

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
from right to left but it doesn't matter

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.779 
from right to left but it doesn't matter
whatever<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.959> comfortable<00:02:09.289> for<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.729> I

whatever is comfortable for you and I

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.250 
whatever is comfortable for you and I
just<00:02:11.000> want<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.239> show<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> something<00:02:11.989> if<00:02:12.110> I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
just want to show you something if I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.009 
just want to show you something if I
pull<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> left<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.400> blend<00:02:13.900> hopefully<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
pull to the left to blend hopefully you

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.820 
pull to the left to blend hopefully you
can<00:02:15.170> see

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
can see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.630 
can see
get<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:16.460> bit<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.850> darker<00:02:17.270> color<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:19.430> I

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
get a little bit of a darker color if I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.420 
get a little bit of a darker color if I
pull<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> left<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.830> gives<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.310> illusion

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
pull to the left it gives the illusion

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.250 
pull to the left it gives the illusion
that<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.600> angle<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.540> slope<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that the angle or the slope of the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
that the angle or the slope of the
mountain<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.800> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> right<00:02:28.580> if<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.420> pull

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
mountain is going to the right if I pull

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.460 
mountain is going to the right if I pull
on<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> right<00:02:30.440> side<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> peak<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.700> this

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
on the right side of the peak like this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230 
on the right side of the peak like this
gives<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.710> illusion<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> angle<00:02:35.060> of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
gives the illusion that the angle of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.150 
gives the illusion that the angle of
that<00:02:35.930> slope<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:37.120> angling<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.540> right<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
that slope is angling to the right and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.740 
that slope is angling to the right and
whether<00:02:40.400> you're<00:02:40.610> left<00:02:40.880> or<00:02:41.120> right-handed

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
whether you're left or right-handed

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.270 
whether you're left or right-handed
you'll<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.050> doing<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> same<00:02:42.650> thing<00:02:45.280> now

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
you'll be doing the same thing now

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.550 
you'll be doing the same thing now
because<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:46.970> darker<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.050> looks<00:02:48.350> like

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
because this is darker this looks like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.460 
because this is darker this looks like
it's<00:02:49.000> closer<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.450> us<00:02:50.660> than<00:02:50.930> this

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
it's closer to us than this

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.000 
it's closer to us than this
one<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> distance<00:02:52.490> or<00:02:52.850> behind<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.830> I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
one in the distance or behind it if I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.410 
one in the distance or behind it if I
make<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> little<00:02:55.670> bit<00:02:55.850> darker<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> little

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
make this a little bit darker a little

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.710 
make this a little bit darker a little
bit<00:02:56.690> more<00:02:56.930> blue<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.630> black<00:03:01.540> hopefully<00:03:02.540> you'll

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
bit more blue and black hopefully you'll

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.120 
bit more blue and black hopefully you'll
be<00:03:02.750> able<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.110> see<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:05.560> that's<00:03:06.560> all<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:06.980> is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
be able to see this that's all there is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.380 
be able to see this that's all there is
to<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.550> you're<00:03:07.850> just<00:03:08.060> blending<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:11.240> the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
to it you're just blending it in to the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.030 
to it you're just blending it in to the
surrounding<00:03:12.110> sky<00:03:13.630> now<00:03:14.630> if<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.020> add<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.710> little

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
surrounding sky now if I add a little

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.340 
surrounding sky now if I add a little
bit<00:03:16.220> more<00:03:16.330> paint<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.690> brush<00:03:20.080> still<00:03:21.080> blue

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
bit more paint to my brush still blue

black and a little bit of white and I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.690 
black and a little bit of white and I
come<00:03:24.170> down<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.860> another<00:03:25.160> row<00:03:25.459> maybe

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
come down to do another row maybe

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.110 
come down to do another row maybe
there's<00:03:25.970> another<00:03:26.560> big<00:03:27.560> mountain<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.790> lives

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
there's another big mountain that lives

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.590 
there's another big mountain that lives
right<00:03:29.570> here<00:03:34.480> these<00:03:35.480> are<00:03:35.660> my<00:03:35.900> mountains

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
right here these are my mountains

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.230 
right here these are my mountains
because<00:03:38.600> I'm<00:03:38.780> creating

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.070 

see<00:03:42.930> I'm<00:03:43.110> pulling<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.860> right<00:03:44.840> from<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
see I'm pulling to the right from the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640 
see I'm pulling to the right from the
peak<00:03:46.730> angling<00:03:47.730> my<00:03:47.760> brush<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.690> angle<00:03:49.440> or

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
peak angling my brush to the angle or

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.320 
peak angling my brush to the angle or
edge<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.970> shape<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.480> I've<00:03:51.570> created<00:03:53.330> going

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
edge the shape that I've created going

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.390 
edge the shape that I've created going
back<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.870> forth<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.470> blend<00:03:55.800> with<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.070> wet

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
back and forth to blend with the wet

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.760 
back and forth to blend with the wet
paint<00:03:56.700> these<00:03:56.970> are<00:03:57.150> oil-based<00:03:57.540> paints<00:03:57.990> and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
paint these are oil-based paints and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.840 
paint these are oil-based paints and
then<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.970> pull<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> left

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
then if I pull to the left

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.060 
then if I pull to the left
it<00:04:02.850> will<00:04:03.000> give<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.480> illusion<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:06.180> slope

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
it will give that illusion of the slope

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.860 
it will give that illusion of the slope
angling<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.460> left<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.690> make<00:04:12.840> it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
angling to the left and you can make it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.500 
angling to the left and you can make it
as<00:04:13.110> steep<00:04:13.500> as<00:04:13.710> you<00:04:13.860> want<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:17.270> add<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.300> little

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
as steep as you want to I add a little

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.010 
as steep as you want to I add a little
white<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.170> can<00:04:19.380> see<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:20.450> can<00:04:21.450> create<00:04:21.720> some

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
white you can see I can create some

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.840 
white you can see I can create some
little<00:04:22.380> bit<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.650> snow<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.370> top<00:04:25.250> I'm<00:04:26.250> using<00:04:26.610> a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
little bit of snow on top I'm using a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.600 
little bit of snow on top I'm using a
light<00:04:27.090> pressure<00:04:27.860> before<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.890> was<00:04:29.100> using<00:04:29.310> a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
light pressure before I was using a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:39.290 
light pressure before I was using a
medium<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.540> hard<00:04:30.750> pressure<00:04:36.890> now<00:04:37.890> if<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.310> go<00:04:39.030> back

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
medium to hard pressure now if I go back

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.360 
medium to hard pressure now if I go back
up<00:04:39.510> here<00:04:39.870> with<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.140> little<00:04:40.290> bit<00:04:40.560> more<00:04:40.890> blue<00:04:41.340> and

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
up here with a little bit more blue and

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.750 
up here with a little bit more blue and
black<00:04:43.040> there's<00:04:44.040> so<00:04:44.220> many<00:04:44.340> different<00:04:44.730> things

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
black there's so many different things

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.850 
black there's so many different things
to<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.900> can<00:04:46.080> create<00:04:46.350> let<00:04:46.590> me<00:04:46.680> get<00:04:46.830> a

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
to that you can create let me get a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.260 
to that you can create let me get a
little<00:04:46.950> bit<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.280> pain<00:04:47.580> can't<00:04:48.000> see<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.450> I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
little bit more pain can't see that I

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.090 
little bit more pain can't see that I
can<00:04:51.270> add<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.450> little<00:04:51.810> shadow<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.660> side<00:04:55.100> of

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
can add a little shadow to this side of

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.140 
can add a little shadow to this side of
the<00:04:56.310> mountain<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:59.190> more<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.490> go<00:04:59.670> over<00:05:00.060> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the mountain and the more I go over it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.970 
the mountain and the more I go over it
the<00:05:00.180> more<00:05:00.330> tones<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.140> down<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.710> not<00:05:01.830> as

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
the more tones it down so it's not as

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.240 
the more tones it down so it's not as
dark<00:05:02.220> as<00:05:02.430> when<00:05:02.640> I<00:05:02.670> started<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.800> go<00:05:07.950> back

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
dark as when I started and I can go back

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.750 
dark as when I started and I can go back
a<00:05:09.380> little<00:05:10.380> bit<00:05:10.560> more<00:05:10.800> white<00:05:13.010> go<00:05:14.010> closer<00:05:14.340> to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
a little bit more white go closer to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.390 
a little bit more white go closer to
this<00:05:14.940> edge

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.320 

so<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.030> looks<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.840> is<00:05:21.169> now<00:05:22.120> in<00:05:23.120> front<00:05:23.780> of

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
so it looks like this is now in front of

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.900 
so it looks like this is now in front of
that<00:05:26.330> shadowy<00:05:26.900> mountain<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.550> could<00:05:31.760> have

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
that shadowy mountain and I could have

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.820 
that shadowy mountain and I could have
more<00:05:32.150> snow<00:05:36.370> this<00:05:37.370> is<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> very<00:05:38.090> light<00:05:38.360> pressure

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
more snow this is a very light pressure

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.240 
more snow this is a very light pressure
barely<00:05:39.830> touching<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.340> canvas<00:05:41.860> can't<00:05:42.860> stress

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
barely touching the canvas can't stress

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.090 
barely touching the canvas can't stress
that<00:05:43.280> enough
