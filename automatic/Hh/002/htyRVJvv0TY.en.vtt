good backup strategy is incredibly
important<00:00:28.020> for<00:00:28.050> digital<00:00:28.500> files<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:29.099> if

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
important for digital files because if

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730 
important for digital files because if
it's<00:00:29.369> gone<00:00:29.579> in<00:00:30.240> most<00:00:30.539> cases<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.560> gone

you<00:00:31.770> can<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.220> image<00:00:32.579> recovery<00:00:32.910> software<00:00:33.300> but

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you can use image recovery software but

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.799 
you can use image recovery software but
trust<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.699> disaster<00:00:36.239> area

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
trust me it's it's a disaster area

trust me it's it's a disaster area
now<00:00:37.350> our<00:00:37.710> backup<00:00:38.129> strategy<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.699> normally<00:00:39.150> they

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
now our backup strategy is normally they

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.720 
now our backup strategy is normally they
will<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.930> backup<00:00:40.440> off-site<00:00:40.830> which<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
will use one backup off-site which we

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
will use one backup off-site which we
update<00:00:42.089> like<00:00:42.390> once<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> month<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.739> one

naysayer tower now during copying this
weekend<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:55.049> lost<00:00:55.290> one<00:00:55.619> session

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
weekend we actually lost one session

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
because one of our backups actually

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.700 
because one of our backups actually
crashed<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.809> how<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.869> you<00:01:01.049> get<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.350> images

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
back well with data recovery it's often

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
back well with data recovery it's often
a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> gamble<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.479> let's<00:01:06.689> say

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

a disaster use one on one I normally use
standard<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.400> as<00:01:50.790> mentioned<00:01:51.540> before<00:01:51.630> we

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
there we go

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.809 
there we go
say<00:03:15.480> open<00:03:15.900> image<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.980> here<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.519> go<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.760> now

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
say open image and here we go and now

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.520 
say open image and here we go and now
you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.120> store<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.959> course<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you can store it of course it's the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.039 
you can store it of course it's the
resolution<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> preview<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.269> it's<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.870> as

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
resolution of the preview so it's not as

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.809 
resolution of the preview so it's not as
big<00:03:22.230> as<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.530> original<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:23.130> unless<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.670> use

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
big as the original one unless you use

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.600 
big as the original one unless you use
one-on-one<00:03:24.299> previews<00:03:25.010> but<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> lot<00:03:26.519> of

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
one-on-one previews but this is a lot of

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.699 
one-on-one previews but this is a lot of
work<00:03:26.760> right<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.690> main<00:03:27.840> problem<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.440> if

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
work right and the main problem is if

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.580 
work right and the main problem is if
you<00:03:28.860> need<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> lot<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.970> images<00:03:30.329> back

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
you need to get a lot of images back

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.789 
you need to get a lot of images back
let's<00:03:31.590> say<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.250> was<00:03:32.459> reality<00:03:33.799> that

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
let's say that this was reality that

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.960 
let's say that this was reality that
will<00:03:34.890> take<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.099> lot<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.340> time<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.849> will

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
will take a lot of time and will

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.590 
will take a lot of time and will
probably<00:03:36.510> cost<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.220> well<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.519> don't<00:03:39.269> even<00:03:39.389> want

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
probably cost you well I don't even want

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.599 
probably cost you well I don't even want
to<00:03:39.660> think<00:03:39.750> about<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.260> one<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.620> there's<00:03:41.459> also

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
to think about that one so there's also

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.809 
to think about that one so there's also
a<00:03:41.760> plugin<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.250> actually<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> pretty

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
that's a pretty handy if for example

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.110 
that's a pretty handy if for example
onedrive<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.990> missing<00:04:28.320> or<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.830> have<00:04:29.669> several

by accident and begin extraction now
this<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.950> lot<00:04:38.310> faster<00:04:38.520> right<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.210> shows

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
this is a lot faster right and it shows

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.999 
this is a lot faster right and it shows
you<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:39.660> resolution<00:04:40.200> also<00:04:41.300> so

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
you the resolution also so

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.950 
you the resolution also so
first<00:04:44.699> make<00:04:44.969> sure<00:04:44.999> you<00:04:45.389> have<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.569> good<00:04:45.749> backup

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
first make sure you have a good backup

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.950 
first make sure you have a good backup
system<00:04:46.469> because<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.009> is<00:04:47.219> a<00:04:47.400> last<00:04:47.879> resort<00:04:48.689> you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
system because this is a last resort you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.320 
system because this is a last resort you
won't<00:04:49.379> get<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.919> original<00:04:50.159> images<00:04:50.909> bad<00:04:51.119> guys

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
won't get the original images bad guys

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.570 
won't get the original images bad guys
even<00:04:52.110> if<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.319> store<00:04:52.529> one-on-one<00:04:53.039> previews

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
even if you store one-on-one previews

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.839 
even if you store one-on-one previews
it's<00:04:53.789> not<00:04:54.029> as<00:04:54.180> good<00:04:54.360> as<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.689> original<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:56.550> if

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
it's not as good as the original but if

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.579 
it's not as good as the original but if
you<00:04:57.180> have<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.449> choose<00:04:57.659> between<00:04:57.869> seeing<00:04:58.379> them

00:04:58.579 --> 00:04:58.589 
you have to choose between seeing them

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.309 
you have to choose between seeing them
never<00:04:58.889> again<00:04:59.309> or<00:04:59.699> getting<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.749> images<00:05:01.139> back

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
never again or getting the images back

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.950 
never again or getting the images back
via<00:05:01.649> your<00:05:01.889> previews<00:05:02.610> from<00:05:02.789> Lightroom<00:05:03.089> I<00:05:03.479> think

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
via your previews from Lightroom I think

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.260 
via your previews from Lightroom I think
this<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.229> a<00:05:04.259> pretty<00:05:04.649> good<00:05:04.860> solution<00:05:05.189> but<00:05:05.999> again

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
this is a pretty good solution but again

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.019 
this is a pretty good solution but again
make<00:05:06.990> sure<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.349> you<00:05:07.710> store<00:05:07.979> your<00:05:08.249> images<00:05:08.430> on

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
several locations and make sure you have

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.059 
several locations and make sure you have
a<00:05:11.789> good<00:05:12.029> backup<00:05:12.240> strategy<00:05:12.839> and<00:05:13.050> again<00:05:13.770> one<00:05:13.979> of

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
a good backup strategy and again one of

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.889 
a good backup strategy and again one of
the<00:05:14.159> most<00:05:14.430> important<00:05:14.969> things<00:05:15.119> make<00:05:15.479> sure<00:05:15.719> that
