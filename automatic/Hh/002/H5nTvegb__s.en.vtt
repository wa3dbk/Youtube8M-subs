00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.630 
agriculture and ranching in the state of
Montana<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:10.380> one<00:02:10.650> of<00:02:10.770> those<00:02:10.920> things<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
Montana it's one of those things that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.770 
Montana it's one of those things that
once<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.720> leave<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:14.670> off<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.090> school<00:02:15.390> or

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
once you leave and go off to school or

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.390 
once you leave and go off to school or

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
college you know it's something that

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.090 
college you know it's something that
always<00:02:17.550> draws<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.120> back
