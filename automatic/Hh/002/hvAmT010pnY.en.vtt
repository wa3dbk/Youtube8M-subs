00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
know 15 20 % which is really early

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.029 
know 15 20 % which is really early
they're<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.519> good<00:00:26.750> but<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.320> has

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
they're really good but this one has

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.170 
they're really good but this one has
them<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.369> beat<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> long<00:00:30.359> run<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.900> mean<00:00:32.180> watch

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
them all beat by a long run I mean watch

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
them all beat by a long run I mean watch
how<00:00:33.450> far<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> lock<00:00:34.110> bar<00:00:34.380> goes<00:00:34.590> over<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
how far the lock bar goes over when I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:44.930 
how far the lock bar goes over when I
opened<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:42.020> yep<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:44.399> thinking

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
opened it yep that's it I'm thinking

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.860 
opened it yep that's it I'm thinking
like<00:00:45.090> 5%<00:00:45.890> lockup<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.750> mean<00:00:48.750> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
like 5% lockup right there I mean this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.049 
like 5% lockup right there I mean this
thing<00:00:49.140> doesn't<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.820> over<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.629> any<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.469> all

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
thing doesn't go over really any at all

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.650 
thing doesn't go over really any at all
right<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.600> enough<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.350> catch<00:00:56.329> looks<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
right just enough to catch looks like a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
right just enough to catch looks like a
half<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.379> millimeter<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.890> crazy

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
half a millimeter and it's just crazy

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:11.690 
half a millimeter and it's just crazy
early<00:01:04.580> see<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.790> again

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
actually made suggestions on what could

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.130 
actually made suggestions on what could
be<00:04:52.140> improved<00:04:52.350> hinders<00:04:53.070> like<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:55.080> know

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
be improved hinders like the you know

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.740 
be improved hinders like the you know
the<00:04:55.200> steel<00:04:56.190> shavings<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.240> teflon

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
the steel shavings and the teflon

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.440 
the steel shavings and the teflon
washers<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:59.460> know<00:04:59.550> scratches<00:05:00.180> on<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
washers you know scratches on the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.010 
washers you know scratches on the
hardware<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:00.990> shouldn't<00:05:01.800> be<00:05:01.950> there<00:05:03.020> you

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
hardware that shouldn't be there you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.370 
hardware that shouldn't be there you
know<00:05:04.370> over<00:05:05.370> 20<00:05:06.090> hinders<00:05:06.420> have<00:05:06.690> come<00:05:07.170> through

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
know over 20 hinders have come through

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.620 
know over 20 hinders have come through
my<00:05:07.530> hands<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.220> were<00:05:08.400> brand<00:05:08.730> new<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.240> you

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
my hands that were brand new and you

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.710 
my hands that were brand new and you
know<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:10.020> usually<00:05:10.620> never<00:05:10.830> get<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.160> same<00:05:11.370> thing

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
know I usually never get the same thing

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.960 
know I usually never get the same thing
so<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.290> guess<00:05:13.800> they<00:05:13.980> can't<00:05:14.220> accept<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.700> fact

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
so I guess they can't accept the fact

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.210 
so I guess they can't accept the fact
that<00:05:15.090> some<00:05:15.810> things<00:05:16.169> do<00:05:16.470> get<00:05:16.650> overlooked

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
that some things do get overlooked

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.030 
that some things do get overlooked
during<00:05:17.520> assembly<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.330> stuff<00:05:18.540> like<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:19.040> so

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
during assembly and stuff like that so

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.950 
during assembly and stuff like that so
he<00:05:20.280> closed<00:05:20.640> he<00:05:20.910> actually<00:05:21.240> removed<00:05:21.660> that

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
he closed he actually removed that

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.860 
he closed he actually removed that
thread<00:05:22.350> because<00:05:23.160> uh<00:05:23.190> he<00:05:23.910> thinks<00:05:24.270> hinders<00:05:24.660> are

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
thread because uh he thinks hinders are

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.870

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.890 
don't really stay on the farms that much

other people on the forums if they had
an<00:06:12.870> earlier<00:06:13.290> lock<00:06:13.590> up<00:06:13.830> on<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.130> knife<00:06:14.460> before<00:06:15.090> you

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
an earlier lock up on a knife before you

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.719 
an earlier lock up on a knife before you
know<00:06:16.200> specifically<00:06:16.890> hinders<00:06:17.430> because

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
know specifically hinders because

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.370 
know specifically hinders because
usually<00:06:17.970> hinders<00:06:18.540> come<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.960> really

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
usually hinders come in really

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.300 
usually hinders come in really
maybe<00:06:19.890> 15-20<00:06:20.880> percent<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.540> wanted<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.930> see<00:06:22.140> if

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
maybe 15-20 percent I wanted to see if

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.070 
maybe 15-20 percent I wanted to see if
anybody<00:06:23.310> else<00:06:23.520> had<00:06:23.760> some<00:06:24.120> photos<00:06:24.510> of<00:06:24.780> some

anybody else had some photos of some

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.640 
anybody else had some photos of some
really<00:06:25.320> early<00:06:25.470> lock<00:06:26.070> up<00:06:26.370> but<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:26.700> guess<00:06:26.910> hinder

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
really early lock up but I guess hinder

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.700 
really early lock up but I guess hinder
sees<00:06:28.650> that<00:06:28.920> as<00:06:29.220> something<00:06:29.820> really<00:06:30.450> bad<00:06:30.690> but<00:06:31.440> I

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
sees that as something really bad but I

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.340 
sees that as something really bad but I
mean<00:06:31.770> they<00:06:32.190> made<00:06:32.370> the<00:06:32.520> knife<00:06:32.730> and<00:06:33.120> they<00:06:33.320> let<00:06:34.320> it

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
mean they made the knife and they let it

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.200 
mean they made the knife and they let it
go<00:06:34.560> through<00:06:34.800> QC<00:06:35.580> so<00:06:36.050> I'm<00:06:37.050> not<00:06:37.260> sure<00:06:38.060> I'm<00:06:39.060> not

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
go through QC so I'm not sure I'm not

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.060 
go through QC so I'm not sure I'm not
sure<00:06:39.270> what<00:06:39.660> they're<00:06:39.810> thinking<00:06:40.020> there<00:06:40.410> and

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070
