00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
you can easily get obsidian without

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.320 
you can easily get obsidian without

that you're gonna lose is redstone and
every<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> more<00:00:12.719> than<00:00:12.780> enough<00:00:13.049> redstone

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
every now is more than enough redstone

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
every now is more than enough redstone
yeah<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.440> really<00:00:16.830> good<00:00:16.949> way<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> use<00:00:17.250> it

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
yeah so it's a really good way to use it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
yeah so it's a really good way to use it
all<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:19.320> redstone<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.070> all<00:00:20.160> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
all you use is redstone that's all you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
all you use is redstone that's all you
lose<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.150> keep<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> lab<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
lose you get to keep the lab and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.689 
lose you get to keep the lab and
everything<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> I'm<00:00:23.340> gonna<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:24.359> back<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.810> a

on lightning and everything yeah so
let's<00:00:30.750> get<00:00:30.869> started<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.640> what<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> laid<00:00:32.940> out

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
let's get started so what I laid out

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
let's get started so what I laid out
here<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.320> platform<00:00:34.530> where<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
here is just a little platform where and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
here is just a little platform where and
show<00:00:35.760> exactly<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:36.870> back<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.440> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
show exactly what I had back there in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.530 
show exactly what I had back there in
the<00:00:37.739> base<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.610> gonna<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:39.059> building<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the base just I'm gonna be building it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.740 
the base just I'm gonna be building it
so<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:41.730> four<00:00:42.149> by<00:00:42.329> six<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.469> lay<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
so it's four by six and then you lay the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.819 
so it's four by six and then you lay the
Redstone<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> middle<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
Redstone out in the middle just as I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.190 
Redstone out in the middle just as I
have<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:48.329> next<00:00:48.690> thing<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
have there then next thing you want to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.049 
have there then next thing you want to
gonna<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.250> dig<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> trench<00:00:50.789> on

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
gonna want to do is dig a trench on

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
gonna want to do is dig a trench on
either<00:00:51.270> side<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.110> redstone<00:00:52.579> just<00:00:53.579> like

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
either side of the redstone just like

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.779 
either side of the redstone just like
this<00:00:53.879> um<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> necessary<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> water

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this um this is necessary for the water

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.010 
this um this is necessary for the water
currents<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.809> work<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> be

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
currents to work that you're going to be

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.299 
currents to work that you're going to be
using<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.949> once<00:01:02.100> once<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> done

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
using so once once you get that done

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
using so once once you get that done
you're<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> side<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.900> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you're gonna go over to the side now so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.429 
you're gonna go over to the side now so
that's<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.189> good<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.000> above<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.780> you're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that's all good now above that you're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740 
that's all good now above that you're
gonna<00:01:10.619> want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.490> thing<00:01:12.119> above

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
gonna want to make a little thing above

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
gonna want to make a little thing above
it<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.430> above<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it just like that that's two above the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
it just like that that's two above the
trench<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:17.009> block<00:01:17.280> higher<00:01:17.520> than<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
trench or just one block higher than the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.820 
trench or just one block higher than the
redstone<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.909> then

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
redstone just as I did there and then

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190 
redstone just as I did there and then
make<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> walls<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.670> higher<00:01:23.880> around<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
make the walls a bit higher around that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.730 
make the walls a bit higher around that
as<00:01:25.380> well

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
as well

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.850 
as well
so<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.420> finished<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> do

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
so I'm just finished that now all you do

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
so I'm just finished that now all you do
is<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.159> three<00:01:29.610> across<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> need<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is put three across but you need to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
is put three across but you need to
leave<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.140> side<00:01:31.380> open<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.950> doesn't<00:01:32.220> really

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
leave one side open it doesn't really

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.520 
leave one side open it doesn't really
matter<00:01:32.549> which<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> put

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
matter which way you do that and put

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
matter which way you do that and put
water<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.850> top<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.509> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
water at the back on the top there so it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.569 
water at the back on the top there so it
should<00:01:37.020> look<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> get

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
should look like that then if you get

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.810 
should look like that then if you get
that<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> destroy<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.640> pieces<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that all you do is destroy the pieces of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
that all you do is destroy the pieces of
cobblestone<00:01:42.240> road<00:01:42.479> over<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> makes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
cobblestone road over there and it makes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
cobblestone road over there and it makes
the<00:01:43.439> water<00:01:43.560> currents<00:01:44.040> where<00:01:44.850> Tom<00:01:45.149> looked<00:01:45.540> like

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the water currents where Tom looked like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.649 
the water currents where Tom looked like
that<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.360> skip<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that so now that we got just skip to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.380 
that so now that we got just skip to
where<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> got<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:49.979> side<00:01:50.220> done<00:01:50.460> exactly

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
where I got the other side done exactly

hurried up just block over the lava

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.400 
hurried up just block over the lava

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410
