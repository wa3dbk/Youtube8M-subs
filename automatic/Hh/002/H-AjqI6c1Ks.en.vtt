00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.439
 district 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.059

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.849

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.669

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.110
 sport of the city but also the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.079

 people running through the ancient city 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.409
 it's better than thousands of words that's 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.859
 one of the messages that jerusalem sends 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.859
 to the world 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.199

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 part in the last edition of the marathon 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 from jerusalem has been a dream we started 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.640
 running four years ago we saw a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.790
 report about the marathon of jerusalem 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.400
 and coming became our goal 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.950
 founded more than 4,000 years ago Jerusalem 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.290
 It is one of the oldest cities in the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 world marathon runners 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.170
 they make a real journey in time 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 along the route is a city 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.810
 only a really wonderful city 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 excellent German weather is already raining 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.200
 And it's cold 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.240
 the athletes go through the different 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.580
 districts and breathe well the different 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.770
 Jerusalem cultures despite the effort 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.400
 of the race is impossible to ignore 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.380
 the more than 250 monuments that mark it 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.560
 and that become indelible 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.840
 memories a very special atmosphere 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.459
 lovely special sensations 4000 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.630
 years of history in two hours there is no 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 nothing better than this 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.990
 This is how the fourth edition of the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.990
 jerusalem marathon 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 Jerusalem is located in the epicenter 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.530
 from the Judea mountains 800 meters from 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.299
 altitude the city stretches along 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 of numerous hills which entails that 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.299
 the tour of the marathon is very demanding 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.400
 we have a very attractive location 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.860
 for sports and I think to come and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.290
 run in Jerusalem even 200 meters 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.420
 from the church of the Holy Sepulcher is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
 something that people do not forget 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.239
 combination of the sacred city and the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.360
 sport was a safe bet for that 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.750
 the jerusalem marathon enjoys a 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 big success 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.230
 the winner of the marathon ronald keniano 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
 email and curda completed the tour in 2 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.920
 hours 16 minutes and 8 seconds 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.260
 setting a new record of the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.659
 test 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.650
 female category victory 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.189
 corresponded to the Ethiopian Alene Jaime without 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.189
 dempsey 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.360
 it is a special experience 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 something that I needed to do for myself 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.040
 run a marathon half marathon here 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.480
 it produces sensations completely 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.480
 different from any other place 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.270
 it's also history when you read the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.920
 bible you have images in your head and 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:52.130
 here you really perceive those images the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.080
 marathÃ³n has been hard has not been able to 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.870
 a steady rhythm because you're always 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.130
 going down or up and that is very hard 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.460
 but finishing produces a great 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.750
 satisfaction for the environment the culture 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.730
 it's all jerusalem has something special 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.410
 for me because I'm Catholic and running 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.190
 here is something very important in my life 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.190
 fournier 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.430
 thank you jerusalem and thank you all 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.760
 jerusalem is beauty for the look and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.440
