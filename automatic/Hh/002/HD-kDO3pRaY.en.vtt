00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Come closer and listen
The ghetto kids are speaking to you

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Come closer and take
The ghetto kids are giving to you

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't be scared because we will all have our day

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One day a star will shine for each one of us

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The ghetto kids are speaking

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yes, they came with words from their heart

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
Yes, they came to claim what they have a right to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Look for yourself in this country, too many things go wrong

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So they felt necessary to speak up

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Speak in the name of justice

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Speak for a fair share

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
Speak in the name of tomorrow's kids

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.000
So they can live with dignity and eat one's fill

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
Soldier, I won't miss the chance to wear a helmet to say what I think

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I came to free you with my upright hip hop

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The hip hop of princess Yennenga's children

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
For those who refuse shame

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Those who will die in the name of the land

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.500
I deliver my message on the microphone

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300
To those who seek truth and fight injustice

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What's the point of being scared if light is for all?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Truth will appear on the horizon of our battles

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Because each one of us has its day

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Every man has a star, which will one day shine

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Don't let go, insist for change

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.200
A Mossi says:

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.000
"You shouldn't look at somebody else's basket And throw away your old calabash"

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Lend and ear and listen

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.800
The ghetto kids are speaking
