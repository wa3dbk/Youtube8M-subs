first

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.750 

all<00:00:36.530> right<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> first<00:00:37.280> one<00:00:37.550> I'm<00:00:37.670> gonna

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
all right so the first one I'm gonna

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.049 
all right so the first one I'm gonna
show<00:00:37.880> you<00:00:38.090> is<00:00:38.360> in<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:39.370> guess<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.520> some<00:00:40.700> others

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
show you is in I guess it some others

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:50.830 
show you is in I guess it some others
just<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:44.059> think<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.320> clock<00:00:49.840> so

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
just I think it is it is the clock so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.710 
just I think it is it is the clock so
you<00:00:50.930> go<00:00:51.050> into<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.320> clock<00:00:51.500> application<00:00:52.720> and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
you go into the clock application and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.720 
you go into the clock application and
when<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:54.019> starts<00:00:54.350> up<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:54.739> little<00:00:54.949> bird<00:00:55.220> kind

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
when it starts up this little bird kind

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.630 
when it starts up this little bird kind
of<00:00:55.900> pops<00:00:56.900> out<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.290> chirps<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.769> yeah<00:00:57.949> what's<00:00:58.519> you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
of pops out in chirps it yeah what's you

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.930 
of pops out in chirps it yeah what's you
know<00:00:58.730> what<00:00:58.879> hour<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.269> I<00:00:59.530> guess<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:01.460> 3d<00:01:01.820> you

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
know what hour it is I guess in 3d you

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.259 
know what hour it is I guess in 3d you
kind<00:01:02.150> of<00:01:02.180> like<00:01:02.300> comes<00:01:02.540> out<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.839> screen

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
kind of like comes out of the screen

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.940 
kind of like comes out of the screen
so<00:01:05.269> does<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.479> ten<00:01:05.840> times<00:01:06.050> because<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:06.710> 10

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
so does that ten times because it's 10

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.609 
so does that ten times because it's 10
o'clock<00:01:07.509> but<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:08.539> you<00:01:08.660> can<00:01:08.869> press<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.380> make

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
o'clock but I you can press a to make

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.930 
o'clock but I you can press a to make
them<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:09.979> whenever<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.250> want<00:01:10.340> again<00:01:10.700> but

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
them do it whenever you want again but

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.550 
them do it whenever you want again but
the<00:01:11.030> real<00:01:11.180> cool<00:01:11.450> thing<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.080> if<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.440> get

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the real cool thing is is if you get

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:25.210 
the real cool thing is is if you get
close<00:01:12.800> to<00:01:13.070> him<00:01:22.149> and<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:24.229> am<00:01:24.530> figured<00:01:24.950> out<00:01:25.039> how<00:01:25.190> I

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
close to him and I am figured out how I

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.150 
close to him and I am figured out how I
think<00:01:25.550> if<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.759> get<00:01:25.880> closer

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.560 

he<00:01:37.160> completely<00:01:37.670> destroys<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> screen<00:01:38.390> and

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
he completely destroys the screen and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.200 
he completely destroys the screen and
then<00:01:38.690> becomes<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.350> black<00:01:40.070> chirping<00:01:40.700> bird<00:01:40.880> and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
then becomes a black chirping bird and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.899 
then becomes a black chirping bird and
no<00:01:41.390> longer<00:01:42.640> does<00:01:43.640> anything<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.299> screen<00:01:45.909> so

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
no longer does anything to the screen so

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.330 
no longer does anything to the screen so
I<00:01:46.939> thought<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.600> was<00:01:47.750> kind<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:47.990> cool<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.920> then

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
I thought that was kind of cool and then

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.860 
I thought that was kind of cool and then
even<00:01:49.610> neater<00:01:49.880> one<00:01:50.350> how<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.380> go<00:01:51.649> back<00:01:51.829> here

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.340 

I<00:01:59.300> thought<00:02:00.300> this<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.570> was<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.840> cool<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I thought this one was really cool but

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.480 
I thought this one was really cool but
you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.830> careful<00:02:02.220> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.370> do

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you don't want to be careful if you do

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.400 
you don't want to be careful if you do
it<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.000> actual<00:02:03.420> repercussions

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
it because there's actual repercussions

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.020 
it because there's actual repercussions
I<00:02:04.740> guess<00:02:04.950> nothing<00:02:05.280> major<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:07.310> go<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> globe<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
I guess nothing major but go to globe I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.190 
I guess nothing major but go to globe I
once<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.300> globe<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.840> mean<00:02:12.990> it's<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
once you're in globe I mean it's a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.840 
once you're in globe I mean it's a
pretty<00:02:13.410> simple<00:02:13.620> application<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.700> like

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
pretty simple application so it's like

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.460 
pretty simple application so it's like
it's<00:02:15.720> kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> cool<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> guess<00:02:16.320> there's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
it's kind of cool I guess there's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
it's kind of cool I guess there's
something<00:02:16.680> else<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.540> normally<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
something else in it because normally it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.180 
something else in it because normally it
just<00:02:18.690> kind<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> shows<00:02:19.230> your<00:02:19.350> location<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:20.070> in

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
just kind of shows your location I'm in

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.010 
just kind of shows your location I'm in
Colorado<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.810> um<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.560> shoot<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.490> globe

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
Colorado but um you can shoot the globe

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.850 
Colorado but um you can shoot the globe
depending<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.080> where<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> shoot<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.560> guess<00:02:25.740> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
depending on where you shoot I guess you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.460 
depending on where you shoot I guess you
can<00:02:26.010> make<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> rotate<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.110> guess

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
can make it rotate like that so I guess

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.810 
can make it rotate like that so I guess
it's<00:02:28.770> kind<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.220> take<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> picture

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
it's kind of when you can take a picture

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.090 
it's kind of when you can take a picture
of<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.530> cool<00:02:31.590> thing<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:31.920> if

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
of it but the really cool thing is if

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:46.400 
of it but the really cool thing is if
you<00:02:32.190> shoot<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.880> lot

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.630 

you<00:02:47.410> destroy<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.890> earth<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.370> gives<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.610> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you destroy the earth and it gives you a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.990 
you destroy the earth and it gives you a
little<00:02:48.790> message<00:02:49.030> telling<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.910> wonder<00:02:51.910> why

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
little message telling you I wonder why

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.820 
little message telling you I wonder why
that<00:02:52.120> message<00:02:52.420> won't<00:02:52.630> show<00:02:52.810> up<00:02:53.310> well<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
that message won't show up well the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.540 
that message won't show up well the
message<00:02:56.980> says<00:02:57.430> look<00:02:57.940> after<00:02:58.300> our<00:02:58.420> planet<00:02:59.550> sadly

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
way to bring it back so I've tried

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.949

backing out it actually removes the

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.780 
backing out it actually removes the
