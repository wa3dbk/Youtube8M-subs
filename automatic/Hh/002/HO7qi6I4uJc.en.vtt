00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.660
 welcome 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.740
 recognize details my name is kathrin 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.290
 Kopf and I am glad that you 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.390
 watching as each year prepare ours 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.130
 graduate from graduation 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.859
 this year is waiting for a special 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 challenge on you shakespeare 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.830
 sommernachtstraum 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.680
 This really is not an easy literature 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.840
 and how to approach such a job 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.090
 which challenges are connected with it 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.489
 and yet every student is his 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.440
 dance goals can contribute and am 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.670
 end a harmonic whole comes out 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 then they will look 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.930
 the third year from the beginning 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.290
 had a heavy heritage 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.040
 december said human is yes 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.040
 though different 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.270
 a studio production a certain one 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.860
 Role sees that he does not do this role 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.350
 that's why she needs someone from outside 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.410
 the field of view and looks like this 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.670
 Clearly, interactions between the roles are clear 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.430
 a case in the story has to be kept 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.430
 the action has to be counted 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 in the piece of the sommernachtstraum cafe i 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.329
 the role of demetrius and dance itself 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.990
 the role of the titan 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.670
 that's the one in love with him 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.039
 Strictly living together is my life 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.039
 hypo liter himself choreographs the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.500
 puck you learn the stubbornness the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.480
 interaction of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.600
 historical roles first 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.920
 to perceive and also to know how much 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.480
 time you have to take pictures of what 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.710
 means love of today's society 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.940
 That was the first for us 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.940
 background for the story 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:31.120
 What is this fantasy like that for you? 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.189
 some of this question wants to interfere 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 there is this dream level and there is 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.640
 this actually real level that is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.799
 the real level where people meet each other 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.109
 they hate each other, they love each other 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.900
 the third level in the piece do that 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.980
 craftsmen and trainees 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.349
 came to it relatively quickly 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.120
 that they are quite people for them 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.469
 Today, on the edge of society, this is living 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.450
 It can be unemployed be it 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.189
 are people who lost their visions 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.840
 who have no perspective they 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.189
 jump over their shadows and they do 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.169
 Things they have never in their lives 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.280
 and where they are not even for 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.400
 possible that they have it 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400
 can 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.689
 true love exists 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.340
 the work with the other several 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.640
 stage step will definitely be 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.890
 for the most part he with his neck 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.049
 It will be exciting as you get us one piece 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.290
 perhaps leads often head 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.019
 the demand will be like me 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.599
 you would like to or would you like me one more 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.579
 I can make it even clearer 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.579
 bring and there I jump too 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.370
 I believe bring out is that because we 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 Many Bulgarians are in each one 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 has a role that we all one 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.640
 common palette modern hiphop 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 Problem that we danced this one 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
 Everyone here has learned how to learn 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.349
 At the beginning of the can although so 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.250
 could lead to different 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.220
 who have to talk to each other 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.989
 Things have to clear up 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.989
 certain things must agree 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 The Hague want our pupils a 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.370
 dance fireworks off the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.990
 attached we will see and 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.180
 may be curious how it goes on 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.600
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.600
 next time
