will<00:01:56.829> most<00:01:57.039> likely<00:01:57.249> be<00:01:57.609> right<00:01:57.819> here<00:01:58.270> for<00:01:58.450> your

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
will most likely be right here for your

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.690 
will most likely be right here for your
illuminating<00:01:59.289> thumbs<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.369> think<00:02:00.609> I

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
illuminating thumbs so I think I

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.380 
illuminating thumbs so I think I
actually<00:02:00.999> turn<00:02:01.270> them<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:01.869> I'm<00:02:01.929> gonna

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
actually turn them on so I'm gonna

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.000 
actually turn them on so I'm gonna
at<00:02:03.390> least<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.690> battery's<00:02:04.110> real<00:02:04.350> quick<00:02:04.560> turn

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
at least the battery's real quick turn

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.120 
at least the battery's real quick turn
it<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.220> around<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.940> now<00:02:06.750> basically<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.890> turn

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
it back around so now basically to turn

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.830 
it back around so now basically to turn
on<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.460> thumb<00:02:08.789> sticks<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.630> going

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
on these thumb sticks you're just going

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.530 
on these thumb sticks you're just going
to<00:02:09.869> tap<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.380> button<00:02:10.649> once<00:02:11.180> that'll<00:02:12.180> turn<00:02:12.360> them

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to tap the button once that'll turn them

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.790 
to tap the button once that'll turn them
up<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.020> what<00:02:13.250> fail<00:02:14.250> guys<00:02:15.470> how<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> turn

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
up you know what fail guys how to turn

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
up you know what fail guys how to turn
on<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> controller<00:02:17.220> first<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.690> once<00:02:18.990> it's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
on the controller first so once it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.430 
on the controller first so once it's
actually<00:02:19.380> scenes<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.780> you'll<00:02:22.020> tap<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
actually scenes then you'll tap the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.370 
actually scenes then you'll tap the
button<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:23.240> as<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.630> see<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.200> light

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
button once as you can see the light

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.340 
button once as you can see the light
right<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:27.300> tap<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.750> once<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.230> go

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
right up and you tap it once to go

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.810 
right up and you tap it once to go
through<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> different<00:02:28.950> colors<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.640> are

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
through the different colors that are

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.449 
through the different colors that are
the<00:02:29.940> different<00:02:30.240> modes<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.750> apologize<00:02:31.459> so

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
the different modes I apologize so

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.760 
the different modes I apologize so
basically<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.750> keep<00:02:34.050> tacking<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.530> once

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
basically if you keep tacking it once

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.860 
basically if you keep tacking it once
it's<00:02:35.459> gonna<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:35.940> different<00:02:36.300> color<00:02:36.540> or

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's gonna do different color or

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's gonna do different color or
different<00:02:37.050> Amon<00:02:37.670> light<00:02:38.670> combinations<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
different Amon light combinations I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.760 
different Amon light combinations I
guess<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.750> could<00:02:39.870> say<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.440> show

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
guess you could say it's going to show

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.260 
guess you could say it's going to show
up<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.010> different<00:02:41.310> patterns<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.910> right<00:02:42.090> now

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
up in different patterns like right now

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.699 
up in different patterns like right now
it's<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.840> back<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.200> forth<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.590> quickly

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it's going back and forth really quickly

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's going back and forth really quickly
now<00:02:44.250> it's<00:02:44.820> doing<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.150> little<00:02:45.270> spin<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:46.440> it's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
now it's doing a little spin now it's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.710 
now it's doing a little spin now it's
doing<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.890> figure-eight<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.760> forth<00:02:48.000> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
doing a figure-eight back and forth so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.090 
doing a figure-eight back and forth so
you<00:02:48.810> guys<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.200> idea<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.650> does<00:02:49.800> different

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
you guys get the idea it does different

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.390 
you guys get the idea it does different
color<00:02:50.970> patterns<00:02:51.540> basically<00:02:52.200> now<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.220> you

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
color patterns basically now if you

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.670 
color patterns basically now if you
double<00:02:53.850> tap<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.600> it'll<00:02:54.989> you'll<00:02:55.470> eventually

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
double tap it so it'll you'll eventually

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.350 
double tap it so it'll you'll eventually
cycle<00:02:56.250> through<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.820> saw<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.270> then

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
cycle through like you just saw and then

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.790 
cycle through like you just saw and then
I<00:02:57.420> pressed<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> wants<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.140> turn<00:02:58.290> them<00:02:58.410> back<00:02:58.560> on

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
I pressed it wants to turn them back on

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560 
I pressed it wants to turn them back on
and<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.550> once<00:02:59.730> they're<00:02:59.910> back<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.420> can

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
and so once they're back on you can

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.170 
and so once they're back on you can
actually<00:03:00.690> double<00:03:01.260> tap<00:03:01.440> them<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.130> change<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
actually double tap them and change the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.220 
actually double tap them and change the
color<00:03:03.420> sets<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:06.269> example<00:03:06.690> once<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.959> find

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
color sets so for example once you find

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.930 
color sets so for example once you find
the<00:03:07.320> color<00:03:07.500> set<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.400> want<00:03:08.640> like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the color set you will you want like

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.740 
the color set you will you want like
this<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.470> start<00:03:10.709> tapping<00:03:11.100> at<00:03:11.190> once

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
this then you can start tapping at once

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.970 
this then you can start tapping at once
that<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.110> course<00:03:13.380> go<00:03:13.590> right<00:03:13.799> back

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that you can of course go right back

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.630 
that you can of course go right back
through<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.370> appropriate<00:03:14.850> mode<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:16.640> then

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
through the appropriate mode and then

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.280 
through the appropriate mode and then
feel<00:03:17.850> free<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> stop<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.570> when<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:19.019> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
