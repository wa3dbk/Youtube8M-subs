00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.129
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.610
 new episode of bestial equipment today 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:09.470
 we have an ivory coast template 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.470
 352 formation as usual in my 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.389
 channel a team that are mostly 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.150
 Ivorian players as I say to you 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.210
 except these three positions the two 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.300
 lateral midfielders and the goalkeeper 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.520
 Well, there was not much abundance 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.310
 players with quality in those positions 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.800
 and I decided to use others from different 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.149
 nationalities but in the end the team 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 perfectly interpenetrate 99 and nothing a 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.069
 team that all its players are from 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.899
 gold the price is around sixty thousand 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.809
 coins more or less because good of two 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.950
 pretty expensive players that make expensive 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:52.160
 a little the final price of the equipment 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.260
 pretty competitive no problem 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.079
 for 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.440
 will win virtually any opponent and 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.420
 nothing let's start the defense analysis 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.780
 central there in the middle we have a touré of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 medium 81 68 of pace 80 defense 81 of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.970
 head may seem a bit slow but 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.520
 using it there in the middle of the defense 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.490
 of three and accompanied by other central 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.270
 fast like the ones I have there is no 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.460
 no fault we pass to the midfielders 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.490
 defensive on the one hand we have a touré 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.229
 for me sincerely one of the means 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.560
 best midfielders of the game with 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.250
 most compensated statistics 77 pace 73 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.390
 of shot 80 of pass 79 of dribbling defense 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.729
 83 and header 84 is amazing with 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.360
 penetrates perfectly with another trot 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.880
 tank 77 of pace 83 defense are the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.159
 statistics that highlight the two most 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.280
 there is an insurmountable barrier to 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.509
 any attack we pass on to the media in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.610
 the right we have 85 of rhythm and 75 of 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.739
 defense mostly caught my attention 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.440
 this statistic since the means in 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:05.590
 the 352 do not go up much and well then well 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.119
 can help in defense in the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 left we have a player and more 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.500
 herbie attacker 88 rhythm 69 shot 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.600
 87 dribble very agile comes in handy for 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.460
 make skins up 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.900
 and here in the midfield position 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.690
 offensive a player who gave me the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.570
 guys from saná tim marshall this was a 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.280
 bet on one of my streaming was 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.840
 playing against a pretty good opponent 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.110
 I think I had ronaldo Christian and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.400
 others and nothing told me that if I won 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 that game gave me an if 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.519
 I will achieve and in the end they fulfilled 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.739
 your word and nothing here we have bonnie 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.060
 his second and 77 rhythm 84 of shooting and 85 of 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.430
 head 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.200
 I have to stand out from this player about 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.599
 all your shooting power is what most 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.670
 It has caught my attention to stick it and 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.280
 the long shot from outside the area goes very 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.170
 okay have a 96 I want to remember from 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.190
 its effectiveness is perhaps not very 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.239
 high but the town makes up for it without 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.239
 No doubt with the power and good your 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.970
 regular letter was from cee but its doses 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.390
 they have been half a point yes, well, what 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.830
 converted to offensive midfielder and nothing 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.150
 he used it in that position the passes are 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.370
 58 is a very high statistic but 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.769
 well at the end of the game I think it's not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.450
 so bad and it is good to pass both 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.580
 front that on this occasion we have 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.400
 here to dumbia 91 of rhythm 78 of shooting 85 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.940
 of dribble shot a real bullet 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.930
 short, agile, fast player who hits her 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.209
 great and at your side the player a little 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.519
 corpulent flames with something less than 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.630
 rhythm but also a good power of 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.340
 shot with him 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.230
 and seven rhythms 73 of shooting and 78 of 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.870
 dribbling the two have four stars 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.680
 of watermarks and nothing we will complete 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.950
 and the team with as I tell you the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.570
 two centrals that are from another 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.720
 nationality and the goalkeeper we have for a 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.570
 side to kabul for me one of the best 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.930
 defenses of the award the 77 rhythm 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.620
 defense 80 butts 83 and on the other 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.610
 side we put to yanga the transfer of 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.430
 newcastle a red line with eboué like 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.730
 you see but 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.910
 the imperfect with uncle t so fuck with 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.420
 penetration 9 like all the equipment and nothing 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.170
 and finally the goalkeeper would vor 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.320
 swansea a goalkeeper that has gone well not 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.870
 I have had no problems with him 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.940
 and good guys this is the team like you 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.740
 I say pretty competitive so much for 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.320
 gold tournaments like for first 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.620
 division can be perfectly and 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.630
 Nothing I hope you liked and I 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.780
 I leave with the compilation of goals until 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.780
 then 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:39.280
 efe jsg 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:39.280
 Friday 26 users study like 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.400
 and the sky 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:00.300
 in time 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.970
 conway 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.210
 like 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.210
 no no 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.590
 good
