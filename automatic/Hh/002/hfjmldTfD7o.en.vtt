going to show you all of the light

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.400 
going to show you all of the light
levels<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.540> how<00:00:32.960> its<00:00:33.170> distributed

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
levels and how its distributed

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:53.029 
levels and how its distributed
throughout<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.040> screen

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.299 

so<00:00:54.039> let<00:00:54.339> us<00:00:54.489> start<00:00:54.969> with<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.899> aura<00:00:56.289> we<00:00:57.070> see<00:00:57.280> a

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
so let us start with the aura we see a

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.599 
so let us start with the aura we see a
lot<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.699> gray<00:00:57.940> patching<00:00:58.570> down<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.460> can

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
lot of gray patching down here you can

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.950 
lot of gray patching down here you can
see<00:01:00.640> where<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.969> pen<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.780> pointing<00:01:02.229> over<00:01:02.289> here

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
see where the pen is pointing over here

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700 
see where the pen is pointing over here
it's<00:01:04.960> ever<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:05.710> bright<00:01:06.520> around<00:01:06.789> here<00:01:07.710> around

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
it's ever so bright around here around

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's ever so bright around here around
there<00:01:09.039> and<00:01:10.470> other<00:01:11.470> than<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.190> looks

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
there and other than that it looks

there and other than that it looks
pretty<00:01:12.549> dang<00:01:13.119> good<00:01:13.149> now<00:01:13.659> let's<00:01:13.930> go<00:01:14.080> over<00:01:14.500> to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
pretty dang good now let's go over to

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.330 
pretty dang good now let's go over to
the<00:01:14.920> h2o<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.880> obviously<00:01:16.659> we<00:01:17.380> are<00:01:17.680> going<00:01:18.100> above

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
the h2o and obviously we are going above

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.399 
the h2o and obviously we are going above
and<00:01:18.520> beyond<00:01:18.789> to<00:01:18.880> find<00:01:19.210> imperfections<00:01:20.080> these

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
and beyond to find imperfections these

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.399 
and beyond to find imperfections these
both<00:01:20.649> display<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.610> glow<00:01:22.509> light<00:01:22.750> perfectly

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
both display the glow light perfectly

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.749 
both display the glow light perfectly
it's<00:01:23.590> it's<00:01:23.890> very<00:01:24.190> nice

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
it's it's very nice

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.700 
it's it's very nice
we're<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.330> making<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:26.050> review<00:01:26.200> out<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.590> this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
we're just making a review out of this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.309 
we're just making a review out of this
to<00:01:26.860> show<00:01:27.039> you<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.330> technology<00:01:28.869> has<00:01:29.050> come

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
to show you that the technology has come

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:30.779 
to show you that the technology has come
a<00:01:29.380> little<00:01:29.530> bit<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.890> ways<00:01:30.009> because<00:01:30.369> if<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.580> look

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
a little bit of ways because if you look

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.840 
a little bit of ways because if you look
over<00:01:31.030> here<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.929> get<00:01:32.110> far<00:01:32.530> less<00:01:32.560> great<00:01:33.159> puffing

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
over here you get far less great puffing

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.789 
over here you get far less great puffing
at<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.119> bottom<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.659> pretty<00:01:35.380> much<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.770> rest

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
at the bottom and pretty much the rest

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.469 
at the bottom and pretty much the rest
of<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.220> device<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.759> evenly<00:01:37.179> distributed

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
of the device is evenly distributed

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.190 
of the device is evenly distributed
corner<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.560> corner<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.869> h2o

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
corner to corner so this is the h2o

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.949 
corner to corner so this is the h2o
running<00:01:42.009> Encarta<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.240> can<00:01:43.390> see<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.780> it

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
running Encarta and you can see that it

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.309 
running Encarta and you can see that it
is<00:01:44.110> much<00:01:44.409> more<00:01:44.940> black<00:01:45.940> on<00:01:46.179> white<00:01:46.390> rather<00:01:47.049> than

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
is much more black on white rather than

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.550 
is much more black on white rather than
black<00:01:47.560> on<00:01:47.860> this<00:01:48.130> kind<00:01:48.399> of<00:01:48.520> stone<00:01:48.970> off-white<00:01:49.899> so

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
black on this kind of stone off-white so

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.719 
black on this kind of stone off-white so
we're<00:01:50.649> gonna<00:01:50.770> go<00:01:50.920> through<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.190> light<00:01:51.369> levels

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
we're gonna go through the light levels

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
we're gonna go through the light levels
now<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.660> press<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:53.020> glow<00:01:53.200> light<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:55.869> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
now you press the glow light go to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.600 
now you press the glow light go to
brightness<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.709> we're<00:01:59.709> gonna<00:01:59.830> slowly<00:02:00.280> go

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
brightness and we're gonna slowly go

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.440 
brightness and we're gonna slowly go
down<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.530> about<00:02:05.619> half<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:10.119> about

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
down it's about half and that's about

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.020 
down it's about half and that's about
half<00:02:10.690> forty-nine<00:02:11.500> apiece<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.550> now<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.760> really

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
half forty-nine apiece so now you really

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
half forty-nine apiece so now you really
see<00:02:13.300> what<00:02:13.510> happens<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.709> get<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.920> lot<00:02:15.280> more

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
see what happens you get a lot more

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.820 
see what happens you get a lot more
splashing<00:02:16.300> down<00:02:16.450> here<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.170> gray<00:02:17.500> stuff

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
but not so much on the h2o and then

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.970 
but not so much on the h2o and then
let's<00:02:23.590> go<00:02:23.860> full<00:02:24.400> dark<00:02:24.849> Oh<00:02:25.090> missed<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.860> let's<00:02:26.860> go
