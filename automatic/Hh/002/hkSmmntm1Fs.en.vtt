before<00:02:23.120> pushing<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.630> part<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.080> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
before pushing this part right here and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.730 
before pushing this part right here and
once<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.300> get<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.960> out<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.620> really

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
once you get it out then it's really

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.100 
once you get it out then it's really
easy<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.100> use<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.510> expanded<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
easy to use the more you expanded the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
easy to use the more you expanded the
more<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> bigger<00:02:31.710> footprint<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:33.060> get<00:02:33.240> from

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
more the bigger footprint you get from

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.030 
more the bigger footprint you get from
the<00:02:33.690> light<00:02:34.050> stand<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.640> see<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:37.040> if

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the light stand so you can see and if

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
the light stand so you can see and if
you<00:02:38.130> could<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.020> collapse<00:02:40.020> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
you could go in and actually collapse a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.230 
you could go in and actually collapse a
little<00:02:40.410> bit<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.490> if<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.730> want<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
little bit so if you want to get the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.660 
little bit so if you want to get the
biggest<00:02:42.810> footprint<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.010> want<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
biggest footprint you want to get it to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.760 
biggest footprint you want to get it to
about<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.900> level<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.590> extension<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.650> is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
about this level of extension this is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.620 
about this level of extension this is
how<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.950> light<00:02:50.430> stand<00:02:50.640> looks<00:02:50.970> when<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
how the light stand looks when it is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.130 
how the light stand looks when it is
fully<00:02:51.870> expanded<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.240> see<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
fully expanded as you can see it's a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.880 
fully expanded as you can see it's a
very<00:02:55.170> big<00:02:56.330> footprint<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:58.200> about<00:02:58.380> two<00:02:58.680> feet

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
very big footprint it's about two feet

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.060 
very big footprint it's about two feet
wider<00:02:59.370> footprint<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.080> makes<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.410> very

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
wider footprint so it makes it very

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.270 
wider footprint so it makes it very
stable<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.940> very<00:03:06.450> tall<00:03:06.780> light<00:03:07.530> stand<00:03:07.860> if

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
stable it's a very tall light stand if

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270 
stable it's a very tall light stand if
it's<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.880> measured<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:09.810> about<00:03:10.280> eight

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it's I measured it and it's about eight

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.780 
it's I measured it and it's about eight
and<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.610> half<00:03:11.640> feet<00:03:12.120> tall<00:03:13.430> when<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:14.580> fully

and a half feet tall when it's fully
expanded<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:17.190> course<00:03:17.460> it's<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:17.730> recommended

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
to use it at that height but at least

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.170

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
here as I mentioned before and it's very

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.540 
here as I mentioned before and it's very
sturdy<00:03:56.800> it's<00:03:57.800> not<00:03:57.920> going<00:03:58.160> anywhere<00:04:00.550> according

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
sturdy it's not going anywhere according

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.910 
sturdy it's not going anywhere according
to<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.910> cowboy<00:04:02.239> studio<00:04:02.450> website<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.680> light

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
to the cowboy studio website this light

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.040 
to the cowboy studio website this light
stand<00:04:04.190> can<00:04:04.400> hold<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.880> maximum<00:04:05.209> load<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.780> about

stand can hold a maximum load of about

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.820 
stand can hold a maximum load of about
16<00:04:06.800> pounds<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.989> believe<00:04:09.320> we<00:04:09.440> can<00:04:09.530> hold<00:04:09.739> that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
16 pounds and I believe we can hold that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.400 
16 pounds and I believe we can hold that
or<00:04:10.250> even<00:04:10.489> a<00:04:10.640> little<00:04:10.730> bit<00:04:10.880> more<00:04:11.410> considering

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
or even a little bit more considering

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.210 
or even a little bit more considering
the<00:04:12.650> quality<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.220> material<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:16.100> is

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
the quality of the material and this is

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.599 
the quality of the material and this is
how<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.459> looks<00:04:16.669> when<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.150> normally<00:04:17.570> use<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:18.609> with

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
how it looks when I normally use it with

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.250 
how it looks when I normally use it with
the<00:04:19.850> alien<00:04:20.359> be<00:04:20.919> 800<00:04:21.919> at<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> top<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.260> an

the alien be 800 at the top and an

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.190 
the alien be 800 at the top and an
umbrella<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:27.680> as<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.130> can<00:04:28.280> see<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:29.840> holds<00:04:29.990> it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
umbrella and as you can see it holds it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.190 
umbrella and as you can see it holds it
pretty<00:04:30.440> well<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:30.919> very<00:04:31.160> sturdy<00:04:32.110> just<00:04:33.110> a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
pretty well it's very sturdy just a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.040 
pretty well it's very sturdy just a
shake<00:04:33.410> too<00:04:33.560> much<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:35.240> course<00:04:35.479> if<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.750> use<00:04:35.780> it

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
shake too much of course if you use it

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.750 
shake too much of course if you use it
outdoors<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.710> might<00:04:36.860> want<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.100> add<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> couple

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
outdoors you might want to add a couple

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.020 
outdoors you might want to add a couple
of<00:04:37.970> sandbags<00:04:38.630> in<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.229> bottom<00:04:39.760> but<00:04:40.760> overall

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
of sandbags in the bottom but overall

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.650 
of sandbags in the bottom but overall
it's<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> good<00:04:41.840> performance<00:04:42.229> so<00:04:42.320> far<00:04:46.660> it

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
it's a good performance so far it

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.890 
it's a good performance so far it
doesn't<00:04:47.960> slide<00:04:48.140> down<00:04:48.200> because<00:04:48.890> of<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.100> weight

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
doesn't slide down because of the weight

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.340 
doesn't slide down because of the weight
works<00:04:50.900> pretty<00:04:51.110> well

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
works pretty well

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.630 
works pretty well
