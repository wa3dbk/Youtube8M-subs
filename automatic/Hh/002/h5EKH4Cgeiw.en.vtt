i only really burned sensi sense in
there<00:00:12.639> which<00:00:12.969> I<00:00:13.090> very<00:00:13.360> seldom<00:00:13.900> order<00:00:15.930> when<00:00:16.930> you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
there which I very seldom order when you

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.030 
there which I very seldom order when you
burn<00:00:17.230> charts<00:00:18.130> in<00:00:18.490> cincy<00:00:19.090> or<00:00:19.380> warmers<00:00:20.380> they

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
burn charts in cincy or warmers they

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.040 
burn charts in cincy or warmers they
don't<00:00:21.220> melt<00:00:21.730> down<00:00:22.030> evenly<00:00:22.420> so<00:00:22.750> you'll<00:00:22.930> have

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
don't melt down evenly so you'll have

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.480 
don't melt down evenly so you'll have
like<00:00:23.350> a<00:00:23.380> pool<00:00:23.740> and<00:00:24.040> then<00:00:24.160> they'll<00:00:24.340> be<00:00:24.370> like

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
like a pool and then they'll be like

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.080 
like a pool and then they'll be like
hard<00:00:24.910> wax<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.680> so<00:00:26.890> Victoria<00:00:27.370> had<00:00:27.580> mentioned

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
hard wax and so Victoria had mentioned

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.519 
hard wax and so Victoria had mentioned
that<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:30.119> should<00:00:31.119> try<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.690> scoop<00:00:32.050> some<00:00:32.259> sense

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
that I should try a scoop some sense

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.800 
that I should try a scoop some sense
because<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.809> whipped<00:00:35.020> wax<00:00:35.350> burns

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
because that the whipped wax burns

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.190 
because that the whipped wax burns
evenly<00:00:37.810> in<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.170> sensi<00:00:38.440> burners<00:00:38.739> so<00:00:38.980> I<00:00:40.200> took
