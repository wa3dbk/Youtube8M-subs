00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.299
 his transparent pregón presents martín 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.719
 muñoz and his transparent proclamation idea that 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.719
 see 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.550
 here we are with our dear the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.040
 first norm congratulations congratulations 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.600
 for these 300 programs and for all 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.500
 you also because obviously they have 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.260
 accompanied in all the incredible 300 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.370
 but in 300 it's already a matter of starting 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.900
 I always say that with things is 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.879
 question of starting 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.520
 with the jobs that we some 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.910
 they say you do not have to start you have to 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 make that point but things come up 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 with 300 attitude with desire and good 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.489
 the technique is obviously very good 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.800
 technique to taste the technique because it is 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.560
 something super economical that they can do 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.740
 everyone at home with few things can 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.740
 decorate right away something to reform it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.130
 economic economic and we can 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.090
 get in any bookstore 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.560
 as is and then we will use 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.700
 obviously the supra a transparent that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.319
 they also get it in any 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.959
 with that 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.300
 It can be used as an illuminator or 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.800
 as a vase as one wants as what 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.660
 want because the good thing is to achieve that 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.789
 texture a little bubble glass and 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.679
 it stays so cute and with the light 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.679
 obviously refracts and remains super super 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.330
 nice to hear many thanks 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.310
 well then let's get to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.289
 work as well I told them we are going to 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.420
 work then with your question 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.910
 transparent well the superbowl 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.860
 transparent what he's going to do that's going 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.840
 to work on the acetate and going to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.580
 achieve the effect that I am now going to 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.590
 show they will see how easy it is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.179
 work it well the good thing about this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.759
 glue is that we can use it too 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.250
 and we can achieve the same texture on 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.140
 everything for and the good thing is that 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.890
 how transparent is this guy 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.390
 of glue 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.520
 although it already says that is that it is 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.470
 transparent, most are yellowish 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 this as it is super transparent we 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.010
 is left to us with a texture 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.090
 spectacular, I'm going to show you this way 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.459
 in plane and now we are going to work 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 so they can see how it looks are all 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.140
 these little bubbles 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.720
 apart super flexible the material well 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.250
 that is , we can manipulate it and we can 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.000
 give it the shape we want until 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.959
 we can fold it press it we can 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.400
 grab it with whatever we want too 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.709
 with a clip or whatever it is that is 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.080
 we can achieve all the designs that are 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.489
 happen to us good I 'll show you how 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.290
 then this technique is done because 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.090
 it's really good in the first place like 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.690
 We said recently with Normita let's 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.790
 work with an acetate and I relied on 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 the shape of a glass tube you 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.420
 they can do it with a glass they have in 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.549
 house with a vase inclusive that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.140
 want to recycle or in some way and what 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.610
 what we are going to do is work with the 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.040
 flower vase 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.810
 and look, I recommend them for the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.110
 technique that I used for the model that I made 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.720
 is that the acetate is bigger 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.570
 high actually and a little longer 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.700
 so that after to be able to paste it well 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.680
 and that this be firm even the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
 material is going to grab and will remain 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.070
 like a type adhesion dad because 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.600
 it's not really going to hit but it's going to 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.270
 get caught by effect his dad 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.060
 then in this way they are going to cut more 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.880
 or less the acetate well then 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.220
 taking into account to the extent already of 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.470
 glass or the vase they have started 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.500
 to work with acetate as well they are going to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.890
 sweep the clear adhesive and they go to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.440
 start placing it 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.990
 almost reaching the edge in this way 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.150
 and I'm going to give you advice what 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.520
 you must do is first if they have 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.990
 pulse and if they do not practice is to do all 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.020
 a line around for later 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.920
 work calm then let's go 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.680
 working like this all around to put together 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.010
 as a containment they see 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.760
 then once we have ready weapon 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.219
 containment 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.890
 let's go placing the glue of 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:18.370
 this way a tip a detail is not 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.350
 happen to grab the pallet and stretch it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.449
 because that's when we want to achieve 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
 grip in this case I do not want 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.630
 achieve adherence what I want 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.979
 achieve is an effect then you do not have to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.310
 spread it out the less we touch it 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.080
 more crystalline will stay and look 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.180
 you are now going to see just a few 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.889
 little bubbles but the final bubbles 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.960
 they'll see when the glue starts 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.419
 work well when it starts to dry 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.770
 then how much are we going to let it dry? 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.919
 that is a nice detail 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.060
 I advise leaving it for 4 to 6 hours if 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.770
 you want what can you leave for a day to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.910
 the other is not that wii because the question 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.530
 is that I do I can leave one day for 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.620
 the other if they can do it there is no 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.030
 nothing happens but at 4 o'clock 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.820
 6 hours the glue is already working 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.030
 and notice this is super reiterative what 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.100
 what we're going to do is put it together like this 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.250
 all the acetate will leave him without 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.810
 to touch it well we are not going to go around folding 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.490
 I did not take it from one side to the other 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.170
 I always advise them when we work 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.930
 this kind of materials like resins 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.970
 where we go to work there we are going to 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.130
 leave so prepare that place for not 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.720
 touch it well once we have this 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.910
 ready I'm going to move it because I do not 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.560
 I need 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.450
 on the plate as I have it here 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.430
 notice what happens when it dries 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.440
 how is it left with all these 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.590
 Bubble effects looks good 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.020
 transparent and even super flexible 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.060
 we can use both one side and the other 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.050
 and what we're going to do then look 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:49.250
 how easy it is to place it like that on the tube 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.860
 in this case glass rotate and adhere 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.840
 We can adhere with the same glue or 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.700
 just by doing a little bit of pressure 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.900
 It's also going to be half-still 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.150
 I can open it with glue or 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.580
 directly also with some glue 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.710
 that can be instantaneous and this 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.690
 What I do is put the 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.880
 inside that can be in this case 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.740
 as there is glass they can use a candle 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.970
 I work with these electronics 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.030
 that come to me several the truth is 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.320
 great and get them online 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.090
 so that way I can 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.520
 do I can even work nothing more than 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.130
 the work done let's say with the acetate 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.810
 and avoid the tube if they are going to work with 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.580
 A candle is better than go the tube 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.440
 because normite by like fire always 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.510
 I went through so that it does not happen long they will be 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.400
 super cute because then you can 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:36.110
 melt can melt clear 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.880
 a lot of clear heat but in this case it's 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.490
 better then use the glass and 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.750
 let's use a real candle but 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:48.699
 having this fantastic one that I 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.699
 I want colors 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:10.880
 thank you thank you and now we continue with the 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.930
 flour and that will make us a set of 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.930
 bath in captains
