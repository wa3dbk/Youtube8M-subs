00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
that hackle pretty much until I started

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.559 
that hackle pretty much until I started
to<00:03:30.859> see<00:03:31.040> where<00:03:31.220> it's<00:03:31.340> not<00:03:31.519> stiff<00:03:31.970> anymore<00:03:32.420> and

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
to see where it's not stiff anymore and

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.750 
to see where it's not stiff anymore and
start<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.870> get<00:03:33.019> kind<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.350> Webbie<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.950> then

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
start to get kind of Webbie and then

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.640 
start to get kind of Webbie and then
I'll<00:03:34.910> usually<00:03:35.180> cut<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.750> off<00:03:35.870> cut<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.170> off<00:03:36.260> about

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
I'll usually cut it off cut it off about

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.559

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
back to forward on this I usually just

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.479 
back to forward on this I usually just
like<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.209> simplicity<00:03:44.660> sake<00:03:45.079> to<00:03:45.319> go<00:03:45.470> use<00:03:46.459> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
like for simplicity sake to go use the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.640 
like for simplicity sake to go use the
white<00:03:46.819> part<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.299> back<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.780> I'll<00:03:48.410> lay<00:03:48.620> it

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
white part in the back and I'll lay it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.990 
white part in the back and I'll lay it
down<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.980> shiny<00:03:52.280> part<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.850> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
down so that if the shiny part of that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.470 
down so that if the shiny part of that
hackle<00:03:53.569> is<00:03:54.040> facing<00:03:55.040> me<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.579> I'm<00:03:56.120> going<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.329> get

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
hackle is facing me and I'm going to get

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.539 
hackle is facing me and I'm going to get
the<00:03:56.660> tip<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.410> just<00:03:57.440> angle<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.069> tip<00:03:58.370> down

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
the tip of it I just angle that tip down

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.420 
the tip of it I just angle that tip down
a<00:03:58.609> little<00:03:58.940> bit<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.569> then<00:03:59.630> I<00:04:00.590> bring<00:04:00.980> my<00:04:01.130> thread

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
a little bit and then I bring my thread

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.309 
a little bit and then I bring my thread
forward<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.150> can<00:04:02.420> tie<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.690> off<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.170> minute

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319

vice<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:07.790> can<00:04:07.910> go<00:04:08.060> ahead<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.299> spin<00:04:08.720> this

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
vice you can go ahead and spin this

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.330 
vice you can go ahead and spin this
thing<00:04:08.989> on<00:04:09.549> but<00:04:10.549> for<00:04:11.000> these<00:04:11.989> purposes<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.130> just
