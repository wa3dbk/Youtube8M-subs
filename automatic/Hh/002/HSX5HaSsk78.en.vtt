00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.189
 welcome to the bivouac in chilling out 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.449
 cito it's midnight and unfortunately wim 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.340
 Van Ginkel 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.289
 is not yet within my jos smink 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.990
 on the other hand comes in and that 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.830
 let's talk further in this 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.290
 journal 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.110
 the exclusive interview with Rintje 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.940
 Ritsma, who says this among other things 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.100
 it's what runs if you have a docker 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.120
 start and then the two days just pass by 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.250
 to chop the opportunities 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.030
 but of course we start with the route 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.730
 from today from san juan to chilecito 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.030
 a huge tough stage the toughest 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.480
 stage so far in the dakar anyway 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 two specials and in between and 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.070
 connecting route 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.440
 200 km the first special 175 km 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.460
 about in between and then another 200 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.660
 kilometers 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:15.730
 but of course start with this late 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.730
 me that is in that of dhaka 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.270
 but actually you can only get one 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.510
 use a word for that it is beautiful 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.920
 pussy yes it is a mess if you have one 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.900
 roof its start and then the two days 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.020
 just to chill along the odds 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.610
 so for the sake of convenience, you are going a bit 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.370
 financially going from the earth 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.190
 we want to get it anyway but it was anyway 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.990
 not so easy to get into the dunes 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.640
 I have seen it I have not underestimated 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.840
 that you are well prepared we already have to 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 to be able to experience you were really completely 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 totally fancy you put your teeth 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.560
 in what did it eventually go wrong 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.560
 we have replaced a turbo at kees 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.730
 coal and yes, that naturally takes 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.700
 just before it's done 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.470
 and yes, we will simply start again 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.660
 continue with the match and then on 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.130
 given moment you come into the garden 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 he may be there are so many already 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.850
 everyone is for you because we 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.890
 were really the last car but then 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.990
 it already has a large tubers pathways 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.520
 you have to go and then it's speed all 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.890
 pieces much lower of course certainly 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.380
 because very heavy and then you come the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.880
 dunes in with lies still and then goes 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.260
 it is okay then you can reasonable the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.959
 find route but then it becomes 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.230
 dim and then you see nothing in it anymore 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.120
 just wanted to see zero again 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.950
 beautiful starry sky by the way but that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.750
 Lenbrook what heels one had but he 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 makes us a bit worried 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.230
 it it happens you do not no you 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.410
 remains of course knokke 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 Everyone is busy getting that car quickly 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.360
 possible to get to the finals and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.640
 you continue to believe in it and even after we 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 had faith at half past four 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.730
 I said we should go from boys now 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.430
 we just rest just because 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.290
 sure daniel and swim those that were standing 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.730
 real back on the boat because he himself 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.530
 wanted to see where should we go down 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.319
 so it's in and out of the car every time 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.030
 and then yes then I stay in the middle 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.250
 and then they came back from we go 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.569
 go back there and you stay giving up 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.340
 just on the same piece you go back and forth 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.260
 drive to find a good thumb that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.970
 you can go one step further but 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.470
 in dark you see nowhere are you must 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.120
 walk very far you also have to go to the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.560
 walk next top to look for it 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.970
 is behind it again 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.379
 so you run very well and year 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.360
 don't hurry on its oil by it 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.459
 finally stayed with 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:48.420
 yes we are the next day we are 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.040
 around an hour or four and five 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.870
 arrived so have had to go 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.970
 still do something again 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.799
 so yes we have the good there 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.180
 utilized would say that was not the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.560
 meaning it is a bit early now 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.910
 to look back but better air 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 states 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.940
 Well, yes , an actor says yes 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.069
 not if I am not in us because we 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.370
 have not made any mistakes 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.750
 we have been on the wrong day for a year 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.220
 have had the misfortune to be in that garden too 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.870
 end up of course it is afterwards 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.970
 it is also very last called tappers 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 so if you have a day with a lot of bad luck 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.820
 the team and you need that service 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.820
 then it becomes late and then knows 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.860
 you get it in the middle of the night on the letter 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.720
 her arm is coming and that now also have 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.919
 and then and then it just falls 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.690
 against and then it is the 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.410
 disappointment is so great following you 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.410
 years yet more opportunities 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:41.910
 yes that was the me lies it is now 7 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.700
 o'clock in the morning for me like you four o'clock 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.280
 within all five women within a day 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.099
 me like a very long day yes well what we do 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.020
 money and yes that can make me grow very old 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.940
 that's here but we have to go again today 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.010
 do such a monster stage'm in my 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.050
 you have not been to the management who may 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.460
 u after the last start 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.620
 yes that's right we are indeed what 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.760
 later in, of course, repeat downtown 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.840
 were asked when the were allowed 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.750
 start today that's all none 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.760
 problem in itself but yes that is in itself 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.860
 though one is not low so we are allowed here 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.120
 fall up to an hour after last state 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.449
 but that says there is none 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.160
 issue 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.449
 so I'd rather have an all that route 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.070
 men have let something start 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.270
 we get up early is my all 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.130
 because you live your way 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.240
 We're sure new the long days you say 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.560
 tell the boys from this is 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.450
 a little piece that they know comes that 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.800
 because you already have so much about those stones 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.669
 drove all those blows that that car 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.320
 got 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.820
 yes that certainly has something to do with it 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.950
 also because of course we have a long time 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.690
 must drive was broken off stuff 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.099
 discontinued bidding support 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.990
 you get the car much more at 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.120
 so if you really want it 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.620
 actually there is consequential damage again 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.229
 yes that's a bit of a problem 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.270
 what is plan in for you 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.100
 after just driving again today and 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.990
 yes at we actually still just 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.820
 calmed down at its own pace 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.260
 we're going to do it again today and like it 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.950
 address have no problems then we are 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.950
 tomorrow again 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.500
 save your lost question lost 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.630
 the window for sticks oh yes that is 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.270
 i yes she is full in inholland council 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.800
 there even more yes I think it will make 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.350
 the fact that you last so late in 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.340
 was that it would be nicer 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.200
 what have you been through is it 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.880
 a little easier today 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.740
 today where play is going ah was one 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.990
 tough day robers spicy 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.630
 the so much more with the long arms too 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.740
 house belong but yes better profile 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.630
 yesterday yesterday headline things 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.400
 experienced that you have them too 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.030
 scissors on the front 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.310
 yes there must be the 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.050
 cabin supports harbor arches that the search 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.060
 and construction errors you something like that to me 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.940
 change that's the hump 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.070
 tomorrow another tough day can you can 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.200
 you and your team that would and the car would 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.420
 need something at the end 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.990

 another one along the way it's sometimes 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.090
 just take a shower shave 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.580
