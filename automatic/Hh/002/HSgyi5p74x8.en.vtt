of spin Tec muffler in half it looks
like<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.630> whole<00:00:24.900> bunch

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
like this you kind of have a whole bunch

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620 
like this you kind of have a whole bunch
of<00:00:25.380> curly<00:00:25.769> cubes<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.570> the

of curly cubes and that is how the
muffler<00:00:28.080> works<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.859> theory<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
muffler works see there's this theory of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.970 
muffler works see there's this theory of
thermal<00:00:30.300> dynamics<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
thermal dynamics that they use and it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
thermal dynamics that they use and it's
true<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.730> increase<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.300> heat<00:00:33.690> energy

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
true as you increase a heat energy

the<00:00:39.930> molecules<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.649> form<00:00:40.860> neatly

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the molecules kind of form neatly

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310

compact groups similar to something that

compact groups similar to something that
you<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> solid<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.820> easy

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you would see in a solid so it's easy

see<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> glass<00:01:26.820> pack<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
see in a glass pack and that's where the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.929 
see in a glass pack and that's where the
exhaust<00:01:28.590> gas<00:01:28.829> escapes<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> can't<00:01:29.820> go

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
exhaust gas escapes because it can't go

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
exhaust gas escapes because it can't go
through<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> dead<00:01:30.360> end<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.140> goes<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.560> through

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
through a dead end it goes out through

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
through a dead end it goes out through
here<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.939> interesting<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.600> not

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
here and the interesting thing is not

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
here and the interesting thing is not
all<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> exhaust<00:01:34.409> gas<00:01:34.740> gets<00:01:35.189> sucked<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.700> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
all the exhaust gas gets sucked up in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.100 
all the exhaust gas gets sucked up in
these<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.210> curls<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> goes

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
these little curls some of it goes

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
these little curls some of it goes
around<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> outside<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> does<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
around the outside and when it does that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
around the outside and when it does that
it<00:01:39.810> pushes<00:01:40.049> air<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> creates

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it pushes air out of the way and creates

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.020 
it pushes air out of the way and creates
a<00:01:41.220> vacuums

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a vacuums

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.609 
a vacuums
create<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.659> creating<00:01:42.990> essentially<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
create and creating essentially what is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.940 
create and creating essentially what is
it<00:01:43.799> exhaust<00:01:44.340> gas<00:01:44.610> scavenging<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.619> theory

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it exhaust gas scavenging so the theory

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
it exhaust gas scavenging so the theory
behind<00:01:47.100> spin<00:01:48.090> tech<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
behind spin tech is that it's going to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.300 
behind spin tech is that it's going to
allow<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.500> car<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> generate<00:01:50.100> more

here with these little perforations but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.020 
here with these little perforations but
the<00:02:16.500> idea<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.190> thermal<00:02:17.580> energy

it's the more randomness of this system

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's the more randomness of this system
more<00:02:21.510> randomness<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.140> molecules<00:02:22.620> that's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
more randomness of the molecules that's

really like not to also mention that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.460 
really like not to also mention that
they're<00:02:38.460> also<00:02:38.580> made<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:38.970> USA<00:02:39.390> spit<00:02:40.290> tec

marks on their mufflers in fact you can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.710 
marks on their mufflers in fact you can
kind<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> inside<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> muffler

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
kind of see what the inside the muffler

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.300 
kind of see what the inside the muffler
looks<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.110> from<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> outside<00:02:55.350> based<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.190> the
