00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.580 

yeah<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:24.909> end<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.690> heat<00:01:25.900> was<00:01:26.530> a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
yeah that end of the heat was a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.670 
yeah that end of the heat was a
situation<00:01:27.430> where<00:01:27.670> Huma<00:01:28.630> was<00:01:28.810> wholly<00:01:29.020> priority

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
situation where Huma was wholly priority

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.630 
situation where Huma was wholly priority
and<00:01:29.799> he<00:01:29.940> finally<00:01:31.470> let<00:01:32.470> go<00:01:32.500> priority<00:01:33.280> after<00:01:33.430> a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and he finally let go priority after a

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.080 
and he finally let go priority after a
few<00:01:34.050> big<00:01:35.050> kind<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.770> smaller<00:01:36.340> waves<00:01:36.610> came<00:01:36.850> in

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
few big kind of a smaller waves came in

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
and I kind of was hoping that something

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.940 
and I kind of was hoping that something
could<00:01:40.300> come<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> sec<00:01:41.020> come<00:01:41.320> in<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.680> he<00:01:41.800> would

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
could come in a sec come in and he would

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.249 
could come in a sec come in and he would
battle<00:01:42.400> for<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:42.940> then<00:01:43.060> finally<00:01:43.630> he<00:01:43.720> did<00:01:43.930> I

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
battle for it and then finally he did I

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.160 
battle for it and then finally he did I
had<00:01:44.860> like<00:01:45.009> two<00:01:45.220> minutes<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.850> wave<00:01:46.540> pain<00:01:46.899> but<00:01:47.110> it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
had like two minutes a wave pain but it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:02:18.520 
had like two minutes a wave pain but it
just<00:01:47.290> wasn't<00:01:47.470> enough

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:33.010
