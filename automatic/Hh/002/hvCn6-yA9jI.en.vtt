at Deer Valley Resort we're gonna run
through<00:00:13.809> today<00:00:13.900> is<00:00:14.320> essentially<00:00:14.980> what<00:00:15.219> to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
through today is essentially what to

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.920 
through today is essentially what to
expect<00:00:15.730> from<00:00:15.820> beginner<00:00:16.180> lesson<00:00:16.630> when<00:00:16.720> he<00:00:16.779> come

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
expect from beginner lesson when he come

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.710 
expect from beginner lesson when he come
out<00:00:17.050> here

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.419 

so<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.839> first<00:00:24.050> step<00:00:24.289> in<00:00:24.470> learning<00:00:24.649> to<00:00:24.890> ski<00:00:25.189> is

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
so the first step in learning to ski is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.509 
so the first step in learning to ski is
doing<00:00:26.210> some<00:00:26.359> flat<00:00:26.630> work<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.320> walking<00:00:27.859> sliding

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
doing some flat work so walking sliding

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.299 
doing some flat work so walking sliding
wedging<00:00:29.149> and<00:00:29.300> stopping<00:00:29.570> that's<00:00:29.989> step<00:00:30.259> one<00:00:30.500> we

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
wedging and stopping that's step one we

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.549 
wedging and stopping that's step one we
start<00:00:31.609> that<00:00:31.789> off<00:00:32.029> by<00:00:32.329> simply<00:00:32.660> doing<00:00:33.050> some<00:00:33.379> boot

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
start that off by simply doing some boot

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.139 
start that off by simply doing some boot
work<00:00:33.769> where<00:00:34.040> you're<00:00:34.190> walking<00:00:34.579> around<00:00:34.670> in<00:00:34.969> your

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
work where you're walking around in your

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.910 
work where you're walking around in your
ski<00:00:35.329> boots<00:00:35.570> that's<00:00:36.110> also<00:00:36.409> a<00:00:36.440> time<00:00:36.649> where<00:00:36.800> we

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
ski boots that's also a time where we

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.530 
ski boots that's also a time where we
introduce<00:00:37.309> some<00:00:37.579> fundamental<00:00:38.149> movements

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
introduce some fundamental movements

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.430 
introduce some fundamental movements
that<00:00:38.600> are<00:00:38.659> going<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:38.899> help<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.140> be<00:00:39.260> successful

is learning to ride a conveyor lift way
we<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.909> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.240> introduce<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we do this is kind of introduce the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510 
we do this is kind of introduce the
process<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.679> talk<00:01:31.979> through<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> before

process and talk through it before

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
process and talk through it before
actually<00:01:33.179> attempting<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.719> for<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.929> first

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
actually attempting it for the first

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.050 
actually attempting it for the first

time after you ride two conveyor and get

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
time after you ride two conveyor and get
to<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.270> top<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> next<00:01:36.959> step<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.319> getting<00:01:37.619> off

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to the top the next step is getting off

you've achieved this the next thing that
we're<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.959> do<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.229> introduce<00:02:01.469> turning

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:02.129 
we're going to do is introduce turning

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.190 
we're going to do is introduce turning
turning<00:02:02.520> allows<00:02:02.849> you<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.239> control<00:02:03.629> speed<00:02:03.929> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
turning allows you to control speed and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
turning allows you to control speed and
stop<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.739> more<00:02:05.009> difficult<00:02:05.459> train<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.179> it's

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
stop on more difficult train so it's

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.639 
stop on more difficult train so it's
