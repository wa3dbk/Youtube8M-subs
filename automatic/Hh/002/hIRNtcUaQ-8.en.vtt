00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.610
 so from here my office today topic 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.679
 ramadan training next to him in ramadan 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.780
 many have asked how do I feed 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.400
 like crowing in the ramadan before us 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 This is really a small come 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
 I would very much like the video 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 Do not use for any 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.279
 cause religious conflicts 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 please remember it is tolerant in the gym 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.130
 sounds totally kitschy working 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.539
 is really everyone the same number 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 Muslim friends but also for the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 Jewry 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.180
 Many Christians and as I said tolerance 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 Please, I really ask you for that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.360
 to be tolerant 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.040
 I still really have my hat 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.200
 pull in front of it or my cap again 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.290
 perform how much discipline many 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 raise muslim in ramadan ramadan 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 the month of fasting always falls on the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 ninth month of the Islamic 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
 That's why he is always moon calendar 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.829
 different in the year 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 This year he will start on 28 June, the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.260
 really means the summer in the summer 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.680
 why is that maybe a bit 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 critical because the ramadan the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.430
 is fasting month and one fastes practically 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 from sunrise to sunset 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 and of course there are many questions 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 by athletes from bodybuilders who 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 ask simon how should I train there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 best how should I feed myself 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 that's the way I lose my danger 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 muscles, the metabolism rate goes down 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.829
 and here I want you a few today 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 you can give tips very much 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.560
 train well in the ramadan and yourself 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.200
 feed 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 you do not lose any muscle so no 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.030
 care you can even really on his 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.549
 come new level and can even 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 be defined because the whole if 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.520
 I obeyed as I did the same to you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.250
 explain that a bit 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 intermittent fasting resembles that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.280
 So is iMiEV many bodybuilder 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.320
 spanier on the method and works 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.140
 that's why a few tips from me 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.399
 as quoted by what are you doing in the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.729
 Ramadan sunrise our sinking 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.860
 really only very schematically what is 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.170
 To really pay attention to you in time 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.060
 do not eat nothing drink 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.430
 It's important that's the first one 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.440
 tip the first point is laying eggs training 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 when we are really training somewhere 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.690
 Here you go directly after the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.680
 Training possible already eat and drink 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 that is really the case 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.900
 most important tip that it tip 1 the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.870
 means training so lay either short 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.760
 before sunset or so in time 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.060
 that you really drink after that 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.819
 That is very important for us 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.650
 if we have nothing all the time 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.690
 we must have eaten and drank 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.239
 really make sure we go directly 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.209
 Simple carbohydrates after training 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.269
 And to lead a protein is quite 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.130
 important we empty here purposefully 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.750
 our glycogen stores are ours 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.930
 sugar storage our power store 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.250
 and here if we do it right 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.319
 if we are really correct 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.970
 We bring carbohydrates 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.250
 practically super through this glycogen 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.319
 Compensation, that is, wants to explain the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 and the glycogen stores your sugar 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.239
 memory can fill up so full 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.060
 that's usually what it's like 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.480
 a very nice method of training and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.889
 then really with very many 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.810
 carbohydrates and protein the whole thing 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.560
 replenish protein here completely 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.180
 important essential amino acids because 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.200
 as well as with the sugar as the happiness 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.700
 there are also suspected studies 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.269
 But also own experiences show that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.739
 that also improves the synthesis there 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.049
 can be if you are essential 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.170
 amino acids leads to the third tip we 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.930
 go hither which is important 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.880
 you should really go to the sunrise 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.069
 Be careful that you are very much 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.440
 protein leads to the west really 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.690
 slowly digestible protein so casein 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.829
 and all combined with one 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.870
 source 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.329
 here simply ensures that the protein 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.730
 just dig it slower that is over 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.489
 enough for the day over lent 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.630
 gives off protein or releases it into the blood that way 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.489
 that you are really in front of Qatar 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.359
 buddhism from muscle loss no worries 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.139
 have to have 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.120
 that's why he emphasizes white 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.099
 really a lot of protein a lot slow 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 Digestible protein good fat 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.850
 slowing down the metabolism down 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.280
 I could still lead Pope 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.009
 but the majority of your caps so the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.650
 most of your euro expensive daily needs 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.310
 Carbohydrates really should be here 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.050
 lie 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.090
 You can really come here once 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.490
 eat and then two hours later 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.889
 fill up the whole again filled the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.050
 memory you do not have to worry about 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.880
 do we when training here no 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.289
 have power because I have stayed at 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.210
 shut a video carbohydrates ago 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.520
 the training can look at you though 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.349
 the memory is full then we are 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.599
 here also follow that is called the 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.800
 memory the power memory are there you 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.330
 you can train you do not have to train 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.039
 Do not worry, you do not have to 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.680
 eat carbohydrates to have power 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.030
 that works very well I have you 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.599
 the protein is very, very 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.970
 important and another tip from me 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.639
 together it really tries 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.240
 Creatine with pure in yours 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.090
 Nutrition best here too why 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.620
 creative creatine fills your creative 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.020
 phosphate memory recognizes the creative 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.490
 video but he also makes sure that 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.030
 just in the muscle cell more 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.380
 liquid is tretinin binds more 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.729
 liquid so that we are not here 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.080
 drink and thereby that which 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.729
 We train the muscle 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.289
 easy to get more benefits we have 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.330
 just more fluid in the muscle we 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.860
 have no more power but also more 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.810
 we can exercise longer we can 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.550
 train more intensively and 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.400
 so my tip as well as 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.030
 fourth tip takes him with rheine three 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.250
 to five grams here with the pcs or with 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.050
 the protein-rich food but in front 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.810
 to eat anything with the carbohydrate rich 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.219
 here as I said if that's it 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.930
 you really have to pull through 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.539
 do not worry you can really 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.669
 because very good successes even achieve something 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.229
 So the definition concerns where muscle degradation 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.630
 you do not have to worry many 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.039
 ask now in the whole lent 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.719
 then does not my metabolism rate 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.030
 I do not have to be down after that 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.070
 of jojo effect or similar you have to 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.080
 Do not be there for such a short time 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.909
 There are really many studies going on that 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.620
 do not down the metabolism rate 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.880
 happens only after 34 days so you have to 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.310
 you do not worry 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.740
 These are my tips for the ramadan 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.030
 pulls it through her can train her 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.580
 you do not have to worry 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.280
 as I said drink a lot and 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.639
 train well since tolerantly trained 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.169
 hardworking and hold on till then 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.169
 subscribe to the channel and we'll meet
