for<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.850> seems<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> there's<00:00:36.480> three

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
for that it seems to be there's three

for that it seems to be there's three
spawns<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.620> each<00:00:37.770> map<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:39.690> seem<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
spawns in each map and they seem to be

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
spawns in each map and they seem to be
pretty<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.860> every<00:00:41.010> map<00:00:41.340> except<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pretty much in every map except the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
pretty much in every map except the
starter<00:00:42.180> areas<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.170> personally<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
starter areas so I know personally I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
starter areas so I know personally I
found<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.789> care<00:00:45.600> 6<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.230> believe<00:00:47.780> kadarin

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
found some in care 6 I believe kadarin

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.029 
found some in care 6 I believe kadarin
for<00:00:49.289> sure<00:00:49.820> blood<00:00:50.820> tied<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.539> sure<00:00:52.039> definitely

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
for sure blood tied for sure definitely

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
for sure blood tied for sure definitely
in<00:00:53.160> Lana's<00:00:53.579> pass<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.239> didn't<00:00:54.809> find<00:00:54.930> any<00:00:55.110> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in Lana's pass I didn't find any in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
in Lana's pass I didn't find any in
Snowden<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.730> dredge<00:00:57.000> horn

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Snowden when I was there or dredge horn

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.010 
Snowden when I was there or dredge horn
or<00:00:57.570> Timberline<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.359> mean<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.690> could<00:01:00.899> have

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
or Timberline but I mean that could have

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.799 
or Timberline but I mean that could have
been<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.199> them<00:01:01.859> being<00:01:02.399> deactivated<00:01:03.090> being

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
been just them being deactivated being

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
been just them being deactivated being
destroyed<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.409> respond<00:01:04.860> yet<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.510> it's<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
destroyed not respond yet so it's a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.590 
destroyed not respond yet so it's a
little<00:01:06.689> iffy<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.560> iffy<00:01:07.830> indeed<00:01:08.130> but

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
little iffy a little iffy indeed but

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
little iffy a little iffy indeed but
just<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> look-see<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> look-see<00:01:10.860> for

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
just have a look-see have a look-see for

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
just have a look-see have a look-see for
the<00:01:12.000> energy<00:01:12.180> probes<00:01:13.220> pretty<00:01:14.220> easy<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> find<00:01:14.640> on

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the energy probes pretty easy to find on

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.539 
the energy probes pretty easy to find on
the<00:01:15.000> map<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.430> get

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the map now what you need to do to get

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
the map now what you need to do to get
the<00:01:17.670> achievements<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the achievements one of them is to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
the achievements one of them is to
destroy<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.740> energy<00:01:20.100> probe<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.610> we'll<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
destroy an energy probe which we'll get

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
destroy an energy probe which we'll get
to<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.570> while<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to in a little while but you need to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
to in a little while but you need to
destroy<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.369> five<00:01:23.549> different<00:01:23.759> maps<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
destroy it in five different maps so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
destroy it in five different maps so
obviously<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.500> least<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.799> five

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
obviously there are at least in five

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
obviously there are at least in five
different<00:01:26.220> maps<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.240> more<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
different maps and probably more the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
different maps and probably more the
other<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.070> defender<00:01:30.030> Slayer<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> notice

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
other is defender Slayer now you notice

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
other is defender Slayer now you notice
that<00:01:31.320> there's<00:01:31.530> quite<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> few<00:01:31.950> mobs<00:01:32.430> around

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that there's quite a few mobs around

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
that there's quite a few mobs around
this<00:01:33.329> energy<00:01:33.930> probe<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.470> can't<00:01:34.740> do

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this energy probe and I can't do

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.940 
this energy probe and I can't do
anything<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
anything with it what you need to do is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.450 
anything with it what you need to do is
clear<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.729> monsters<00:01:40.159> now<00:01:41.159> these

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
clear out all of the monsters now these

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.560 
clear out all of the monsters now these
are<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> monsters<00:01:42.000> which<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.270> killing

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
are the monsters which you're killing

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
are the monsters which you're killing
for<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> Slayer<00:01:43.170> achievement<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> need

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
for the Slayer achievement so you need

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.050 
for the Slayer achievement so you need
to<00:01:44.340> kill<00:01:44.490> 50<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> these<00:01:45.119> overall<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.880> need

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to kill 50 of these overall and you need

to kill 50 of these overall and you need
to<00:01:48.180> kill<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.729> probe<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.340 

and<00:02:02.659> apparently<00:02:04.630> some<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.659> them<00:02:05.869> are<00:02:06.049> not

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and apparently some of them are not

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.460 
and apparently some of them are not
exactly<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.189> friendliest<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.569> folk<00:02:08.840> although

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
exactly the friendliest of folk although

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.380 
exactly the friendliest of folk although
I'm<00:02:09.830> pretty<00:02:10.190> surprised<00:02:10.789> with<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> amount<00:02:11.300> of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm pretty surprised with the amount of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
I'm pretty surprised with the amount of
conditions<00:02:11.840> these<00:02:12.019> are<00:02:12.170> throwing<00:02:12.500> out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.790 

nevermind<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.310> more<00:02:16.489> rock<00:02:16.670> there<00:02:17.510> we<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
nevermind one more rock there we go you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.770 
nevermind one more rock there we go you
can<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> energy<00:02:19.489> probe<00:02:19.910> becomes

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
can see the energy probe becomes

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.869 
can see the energy probe becomes
attackable<00:02:22.540> destroy<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:24.580> interact<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:25.700> it

attackable destroy that interact with it

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.789 
attackable destroy that interact with it
and<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.599> yourself<00:02:26.690> some<00:02:27.200> power<00:02:27.440> core

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
and you get yourself some power core

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.890 
and you get yourself some power core
components<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:28.819> these<00:02:29.030> are<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.660> pretty

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
components now these are actually pretty

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.930 
components now these are actually pretty
important<00:02:30.440> because<00:02:31.069> these<00:02:31.519> are<00:02:31.700> what<00:02:31.819> you

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
important because these are what you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.759 
important because these are what you
need<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.390> enter<00:02:32.750> Scarlett's<00:02:33.200> hidden<00:02:33.500> layer

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
need to enter Scarlett's hidden layer

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.910 
need to enter Scarlett's hidden layer
when<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:34.910> around<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:36.230> know<00:02:36.410> so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
when you get around to that you know so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.410 
when you get around to that you know so
if<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.400> go<00:02:37.489> for<00:02:37.610> achievements<00:02:38.090> first

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
if you want to go for achievements first

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.089 
if you want to go for achievements first
it's<00:02:38.959> probably<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.290> nice<00:02:39.500> efficient<00:02:39.980> way<00:02:40.069> of

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
it's probably a nice efficient way of

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.190 
it's probably a nice efficient way of
doing<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:40.970> you'll<00:02:41.180> need<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.450> destroy<00:02:41.780> five

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
doing it but you'll need to destroy five

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.089 
doing it but you'll need to destroy five
of<00:02:42.380> these<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.269> different<00:02:44.930> map<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.500> five

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
of these one in a different map so five

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.729 
of these one in a different map so five
one<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.549> each<00:02:46.640> map<00:02:46.910> as<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:48.049> say<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:48.500> seems<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
one in each map as I say there seems to

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.949 
one in each map as I say there seems to
be<00:02:48.890> three<00:02:49.220> spawns<00:02:49.579> /<00:02:50.120> map<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> roughly<00:02:52.970> if<00:02:53.239> you

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
be three spawns / map and roughly if you

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.930 
be three spawns / map and roughly if you
manage<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.440> kill<00:02:54.829> credit<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.370> everything

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
manage to get kill credit on everything

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180 
manage to get kill credit on everything
around<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.420> probe<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.230> probably<00:02:57.590> need<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.829> kill

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
around a probe you probably need to kill

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.530 
around a probe you probably need to kill
around<00:02:58.670> ten<00:02:59.889> nine<00:03:00.889> or<00:03:01.130> ten<00:03:01.400> give<00:03:01.790> or<00:03:01.910> take<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
around ten nine or ten give or take to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.340 
around ten nine or ten give or take to
get<00:03:02.690> all<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:03.079> Slayer<00:03:03.650> credit<00:03:04.519> kills<00:03:05.230> but<00:03:06.230> as

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
get all your Slayer credit kills but as

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.879 
get all your Slayer credit kills but as
you<00:03:06.440> see<00:03:06.620> could<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.489> little<00:03:07.730> tough<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.959> your

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
you see could be a little tough on your

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.670 
you see could be a little tough on your
own<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.250> mean<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:10.819> is<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.150> my<00:03:11.329> PTV<00:03:12.170> gear<00:03:12.560> as

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
own I mean this is in my PTV gear as

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.039 
own I mean this is in my PTV gear as
well<00:03:12.880> potentially<00:03:13.880> easier<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.329> berserker<00:03:14.780> but

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
well potentially easier in berserker but

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.629 
well potentially easier in berserker but
they<00:03:15.139> did<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> lot<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> damage<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.220> me<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:16.609> you

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
they did a lot of damage to me so you

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.879 
they did a lot of damage to me so you
may<00:03:16.910> want<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.150> run<00:03:17.450> around<00:03:17.569> with<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.079> friend<00:03:18.440> and

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
may want to run around with a friend and

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.210 
may want to run around with a friend and
i<00:03:19.220> was<00:03:19.370> doing<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> friend<00:03:20.180> earlier<00:03:20.389> and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
i was doing it with a friend earlier and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.059 
i was doing it with a friend earlier and
we<00:03:22.220> had<00:03:22.340> no<00:03:22.519> troubles<00:03:22.850> at<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.920> when<00:03:24.920> one's

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
we had no troubles at all so when one's

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.890 
we had no troubles at all so when one's
down<00:03:25.310> look<00:03:25.609> on<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:25.880> map<00:03:26.060> for<00:03:26.359> another<00:03:26.600> one<00:03:26.720> if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
down look on your map for another one if

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.370 
down look on your map for another one if
there<00:03:27.230> aren't<00:03:27.410> any<00:03:27.620> left<00:03:28.870> well<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.900> guess<00:03:30.200> it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
there aren't any left well I guess it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.620 
there aren't any left well I guess it's
time<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.829> get<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.489> different<00:03:31.940> map<00:03:32.120> remember

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
time to get to a different map remember

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.410 
time to get to a different map remember
you<00:03:32.720> need<00:03:32.870> different<00:03:33.319> maps<00:03:33.650> anyway<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.700> that's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
you need different maps anyway so that's

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.870 
you need different maps anyway so that's
those<00:03:35.750> two<00:03:35.989> achievements<00:03:36.160> not<00:03:37.160> too<00:03:37.430> not<00:03:37.819> too

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
those two achievements not too not too

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.990 
those two achievements not too not too
bad<00:03:38.209> getting<00:03:39.019> 50<00:03:39.680> can<00:03:40.069> be<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> little<00:03:40.430> grindy

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
bad getting 50 can be a little grindy

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.449 
bad getting 50 can be a little grindy
because<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.569> do<00:03:41.690> need<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.870> get<00:03:42.109> 50<00:03:42.530> or<00:03:42.709> 40<00:03:43.430> I

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
because you do need to get 50 or 40 I

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.170 
because you do need to get 50 or 40 I
guess<00:03:43.790> because<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.209> get<00:03:44.359> 10<00:03:44.569> for<00:03:44.780> free<00:03:44.989> but<00:03:45.799> i

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
guess because you get 10 for free but i

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.580 
guess because you get 10 for free but i
recommend<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.239> going<00:03:47.660> until<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.930> got<00:03:48.019> 40<00:03:48.470> at

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
recommend you going until you got 40 at

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.559 
recommend you going until you got 40 at
least<00:03:48.799> because<00:03:49.400> that's<00:03:49.849> how<00:03:50.209> many<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:50.450> need

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
least because that's how many you need

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.690 
least because that's how many you need
to<00:03:50.750> continue<00:03:51.319> part<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.889> living<00:03:52.130> story<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
to continue part of the living story and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.640 
to continue part of the living story and
while<00:03:53.450> you're<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.810> mood<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.200> farm<00:03:54.440> these

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
while you're in the mood to farm these

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.199 
while you're in the mood to farm these
for<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:54.950> achievements<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.609> may<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:55.880> well<00:03:55.910> get

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
for the achievements you may as well get

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.300
