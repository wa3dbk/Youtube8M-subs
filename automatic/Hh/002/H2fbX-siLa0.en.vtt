00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
see where I can go and I figured maybe

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.850 
see where I can go and I figured maybe

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.730 
Europe and I traveled all throughout
Europe<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.100> just<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:52.700> sense<00:04:52.970> of

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
Europe and you just get this sense of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.470 
Europe and you just get this sense of
how<00:04:54.740> small<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:55.310> are<00:04:55.520> how<00:04:55.850> little<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.300> know

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
how small you are how little you know

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.130 
how small you are how little you know
you<00:04:56.960> kind<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.380> develop<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.980> thirst<00:04:58.310> for<00:04:58.700> uh

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
you kind of develop this thirst for uh

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.050 
you kind of develop this thirst for uh
enlightenment<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.320> not<00:05:00.530> like<00:05:00.850> formal<00:05:01.850> higher

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
enlightenment and not like formal higher

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.460 
enlightenment and not like formal higher
education<00:05:02.660> I'm<00:05:02.750> talking<00:05:03.020> about<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.260> want<00:05:03.440> to

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
education I'm talking about you want to

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.960 
education I'm talking about you want to
learn<00:05:03.620> more<00:05:03.830> about<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.160> world<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.700> she

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
learn more about the world and she

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.660 
learn more about the world and she
studied<00:05:05.210> with<00:05:05.570> over<00:05:05.900> there<00:05:05.990> too<00:05:06.200> yes<00:05:07.070> I<00:05:07.370> think

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
studied with over there too yes I think

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.280 
studied with over there too yes I think
so<00:05:07.910> then<00:05:08.210> when<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.540> study<00:05:08.840> that's<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.110> thing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
so then when you study that's the thing

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.660 
so then when you study that's the thing
that's<00:05:09.410> why<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.650> think<00:05:09.920> maybe<00:05:10.040> it<00:05:10.190> leads<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.460> me

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
that's why I think maybe it leads to me

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.390 
that's why I think maybe it leads to me
being<00:05:10.940> okay<00:05:11.150> with<00:05:11.360> studying<00:05:11.870> uh<00:05:12.590> European

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
being okay with studying uh European

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.920 
being okay with studying uh European
history<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.669> mean<00:05:13.850> as<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.150> there<00:05:14.540> you're

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
history I mean as you there you're

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.330 
history I mean as you there you're
learning<00:05:15.380> about<00:05:15.470> where<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.919> where<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.310> are

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
learning about where you where you are

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.730 
learning about where you where you are
now<00:05:16.490> how<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:17.330> know<00:05:17.630> how<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:17.990> came<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.380> be<00:05:18.410> uh

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
now how you know how it came to be uh

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.150 
now how you know how it came to be uh
and<00:05:19.669> all<00:05:20.180> maybe<00:05:20.480> there's<00:05:20.750> future<00:05:21.230> aspiration

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
and all maybe there's future aspiration

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.340 
and all maybe there's future aspiration
she<00:05:22.280> has<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.580> are<00:05:22.760> connected<00:05:23.240> but<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:23.900> mean<00:05:24.169> if

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
she has that are connected but I mean if

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.870 
she has that are connected but I mean if
you<00:05:24.500> there<00:05:24.680> may<00:05:24.830> be<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.070> is<00:05:25.370> some<00:05:25.640> kind<00:05:25.760> of

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
you there may be that is some kind of

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.940 
you there may be that is some kind of
base<00:05:26.030> to<00:05:26.300> Sofia<00:05:26.930> I<00:05:27.290> mean<00:05:27.500> we're<00:05:27.650> gonna<00:05:27.800> go

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
base to Sofia I mean we're gonna go

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.670 
base to Sofia I mean we're gonna go
there<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.370> then<00:05:28.460> study<00:05:28.700> engineering<00:05:29.680> well

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
there and then study engineering well

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.050 
there and then study engineering well
you<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:31.100> there<00:05:31.430> are<00:05:31.460> programs<00:05:31.970> available

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
you can there are programs available

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.180 
you can there are programs available
right<00:05:32.570> but<00:05:33.020> yeah<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.380> makes<00:05:33.560> sense<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:34.010> go<00:05:34.130> to

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
right but yeah it makes sense to go to

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.219 
right but yeah it makes sense to go to
Europe<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.760> study<00:05:35.030> European<00:05:35.600> history<00:05:35.960> right

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
Europe to study European history right

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.050 
Europe to study European history right
and<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.890> look<00:05:37.040> I'm<00:05:37.220> not<00:05:37.400> knocking<00:05:37.610> on<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.850> major

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
and and look I'm not knocking on a major

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.400 
and and look I'm not knocking on a major
at<00:05:38.240> all<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.390> hope<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.750> guys<00:05:38.870> understand<00:05:39.350> that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
at all I hope you guys understand that

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.159 
at all I hope you guys understand that
the<00:05:39.590> only<00:05:39.710> thing<00:05:39.919> I'm<00:05:40.040> saying<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.640> that

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
the only thing I'm saying is that

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.600 
the only thing I'm saying is that
regardless<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.320> how<00:05:42.440> hard<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:42.890> is<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.340> earn<00:05:43.400> a

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
regardless of how hard it is to earn a

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.130 
regardless of how hard it is to earn a
degree<00:05:43.820> in<00:05:44.120> her<00:05:44.270> major<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:44.630> how<00:05:44.750> important

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
degree in her major and how important

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.170 
degree in her major and how important
her<00:05:45.260> major<00:05:45.440> might<00:05:45.710> be<00:05:45.890> it's<00:05:46.220> not<00:05:46.640> one<00:05:46.970> of<00:05:47.000> those

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
her major might be it's not one of those

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.659 
her major might be it's not one of those
profitable<00:05:47.840> majors<00:05:48.229> right<00:05:48.440> so<00:05:48.800> it's<00:05:49.280> very

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
profitable majors right so it's very

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.610 
profitable majors right so it's very
smart<00:05:50.150> for<00:05:50.390> her<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.750> go<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:50.990> an<00:05:51.200> affordable

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
smart for her to go to an affordable

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.830 
smart for her to go to an affordable
college<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.160> get<00:05:52.310> her<00:05:52.520> master's<00:05:53.300> degree<00:05:53.330> as

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
college to get her master's degree as

professor and keep it keep in mind
professors<00:06:01.910> aren't<00:06:02.030> really<00:06:02.210> getting<00:06:02.300> hired

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
professors aren't really getting hired

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
professors aren't really getting hired
very<00:06:02.960> much<00:06:03.140> right<00:06:03.350> now

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
very much right now

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.320 
very much right now
not<00:06:04.190> being<00:06:04.370> able<00:06:04.490> to<00:06:04.610> pay<00:06:04.820> our<00:06:04.880> student<00:06:05.150> loans
