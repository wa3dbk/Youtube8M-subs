...and it has pinewood parquet

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:12.778
And lots of stairs!

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:13.978
Yes, a lot of them.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.360
 Wow, it's so cool, I thought these houses 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.720
only existed in horror movies!

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740
Actually, here was shot a horror film entitled

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.740
"Total Blood 2" (Sangre Total 2) 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.580
Really??

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.100
...and this thing here?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.260
This one?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.060
It's an '87 relic.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.900
The Year of the Leather,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.460
Oh, fab, It's so vintage!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.240
They are here since the estate agency bought the house,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.820
you can dispose of them as you want!

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520
Oh no, I'll keep them, I love all these relics

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.180
Well, shall we sign now?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.360
Here's the pen...

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.640
Excellent.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.700
Thank you very much for choosing us.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.780
Here are the keys.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.560
Enjoy your new house!
