00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.769
 fire brigade the netherlands at the big 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.659
 congress and that ended quite well 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 surprising in a fire-sneaker 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.320
 can tell your days a little more about it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.430
 quite a big surprise for that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 everybody 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
 months worked on and January of this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 year 2013 , three people came from it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 the fire brigade who contacted 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 me and suggested we do this to him 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.180
 and a fire was made and I was actually 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 immediately enthusiastic 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
 from the idea that we have already suffered 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 more cooperation, but they are 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 movie heroes and pop stars and actors 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.390
 we have a sports heroes and so as with 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.610
 I think the fire brigade is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 the heroes from the everyday world 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.970
 real heroes of this world who because 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.290
 you already have that pop star and that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.370
 sports heroes 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.149
 that is sometimes a bit in the background 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.040
 to be 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.420
 and I thought it would be nice to have one this way 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.229
 pay tribute to the fire department 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 in the end , that money lives on that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 shoes ended up in the store 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 you have a charity attached to it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 that had his fun get the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 proceeds from the shoes go to the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.040
 burn foundation 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 in a countryman then the foundation why 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.890

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610

 public authority and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.670
 I am very happy and I think it is one 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.020
 honor to be able to do this 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 including then on money 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.540
