00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.649
 Hello, today I will tell you how 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 disassemble the speaker more precisely how I do it 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.809
 maybe someone else is doing it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.710
 in another way he disassembled it before 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.449
 how to do this chore, and for a long time and do have 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.359
 need to be careful not to break not 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 spoil it all started with a friend 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:30.960
 from debts old soviet columns 15 with 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.620
 208 these are the speakers there are 15 hd15 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 here and since I did not have 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 computer acoustics I decided 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.149
 adapt their fruits this thing soldered 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.000
 blood booster especially for them 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.059
 liters tell another video can someone 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.230
 it will be interesting to connect all 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:59.239
 an excellent game to rattle one speaker 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:04.040
 decided to make out began to suspect that 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:08.460
 burnt coil or blur when 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 peeled off the cap then saw that shot down 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.200
 centering the diffuser is simple and the coil 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.409
 Trinity 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 body dynamics why even on the wire 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 rubbed that force it was necessary somehow 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.470
 correct him remembered that coil 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.470
 dab on glue was 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.570
 it turned out not so all just cool in 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 we have a big shortage 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.110
 I did not find him anywhere I decided to miss the mark 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.119
 found in 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 old stocks with glue i.e. varnish breather 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.860
 I hope that they will be audiophile moment 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.299
 it is much to tear as they say that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.550
 if you miss the wrong glue or 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.260
 varnish it will greatly affect the sounds 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:14.400
 understands everything just for this you need 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:21.930
 the solvent i use is 646 knife 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:24.720
 stationery or more that's what we 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.320
 you need her hla that's such a big one 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.200
 to pick up 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:42.170
 cap tear it in a circle that's what 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.170
 you can still basically understand everything 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.740
 begin to disassemble . 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 take a syringe preferably stupa and lo 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.070
 do not pierce the speaker type 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.760
 solvent and start to soak 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.020
 old glue 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:09.030
 first spill the central washer 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:11.489
 in a circle then the diffuser is the same for 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.670
 circle and cap 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:20.040
 so pour too as drying 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.810
 we add solvent of meter and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.370
 recommends even poker flashlight 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.130
 put me so evaporated quickly 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.269
 in about fifteen minutes we begin we begin 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.959
 all with a cap on some burn why 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.590
 cap off and if you don't tear off 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.970
 Now she had to leave the center 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 diffuser start cap 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 tear off like that with a needle 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:57.450
 Scratch gently with glue and under 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.209
 to hook it open, and the same 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.019
 take a stationery knife and gently 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.780
 We start to center the usual puck 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.750
 round 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.379
 neatly cut it all must 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.950
 enter 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:21.049
 fine if not then we continue 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.049
 wet with this solvent 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:34.740
 check than all this is done need to solder 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:41.010
 These are the wires that they do not 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:46.169
 interfered with if we reel 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:52.979
 normal then start immediately collect 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:57.479
 you must first empty the basket from the old 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.360
 glue to clean you can go on the sandpaper 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.500
 arm for before brushing the most 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.810
 the main thing is to glue this gap to 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.580
 garbage did not get there otherwise it will be from there 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.740
 his problematic pull especially 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:17.960
 if it is metal shavings 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:21.660
 adhesive tape and glue quality 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.030
 we make the assembly in the same order as I 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.410
 said if the coil is normal not 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:34.530
 damaged if rewinding number then 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:37.850
 just collect everything to build us 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.010
 you need an ordinary moment glue or 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.380
 rubber glue is by no means super 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.700
 glue as it becomes dry 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:53.150
 oak she needs everything to be 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.150
 elastic insert 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.500
 I center the diffuser with its center 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.310
 pieces of paper 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.710
 can be cut to suitable thickness to find 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.290
 You can cut out of photo paper and that's 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:54.790
 set up 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:57.460
 around the stream here and so it looks 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:01.690
 damage so they don't stick out in that 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:04.300
 when we promazhem because 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:08.910
 suppose but to leave so he 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.910
 stuck to these papers did not interfere 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.290
 take glue moment 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:20.830
 First we coat the centering washer 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:26.670
 we press it evenly around she 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:32.500
 stick then the same diffuser 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:35.410
 we coat well and end well when we 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.730
 the law is all dry we have it so here 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.040
 we put we put the load on top put 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:46.030
 leave to dry for a day 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.740
 then when you plow the papers get out and 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:52.340
 check the alignment so nothing 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:58.570
 clung to us I already at the end stick 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.570
 cap if necessary you can not stick 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.190
 something like this thank you for your attention
