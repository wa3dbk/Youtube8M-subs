00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi guys okay with you before 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.960
 start the video then with readings of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 December, I'll say something to you. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 You already wish I spoke but always 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 forget it 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.059
 with the change of youtube comments 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 and tried to respond to all 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 comments but not always that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.890
 button to hide available for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 me then when that happens in a one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.130
 the channel of people acclimated on page 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 of the person on youtube replied by there 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 if you have not answered there and I do not 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 I even replied that you want to stop 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:01:38.930
 new is because he got lost a little bit in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 low 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.750
 long time tolstoi biography 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.840
 quite surprising because I did not know 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.210
 who had done so much without knowing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.420
 who he was right would not be much 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 thing about it surprised me a lot and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 I later read the book and watched the video 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.349
 From this book I know. 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.990
 probably will be the 15th in 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.450
 channel 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.720
 is a book of poems for those who do not know 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.020
 June is the channel wallpaper of the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.960
 channel and blog too 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.240
 Thank you, and I 'll talk soon. 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.790
 about it here I take time to 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.160
 to digest poetry I usually read the book more 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.020
 at once 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.180
 some poems more than once 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.440
 why I made the video yet 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:51.530
 soon it leaves for when we go 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:53.750
 best of heavenly 34 and below is the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:06.310
 story of five teenagers is 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:29.390
 that a novel of formation so it is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:31.600
 tasty and then take the time 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.600
 current 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:49.880
 he then got and technology things 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:53.870
 can happen in our world 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.390
 so maybe it's a little closer 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:06.350
 of the elector easier to enter the world 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:08.420
 I found interesting will also count 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.890
 the story of a girl hired by 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.140
 a company to try to discover a 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.860
 mystery behind some movies are 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.860
 released online 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.000
 I read life later 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.880
 It's the first book that her name I 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.760
 quite liked also below 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.400
 She surprised me, I want to see more. 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.640
 Her stuff that year I think she 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:05:02.520
 understands how people think and what 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:05:19.500
 they could do certain situations that 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:22.860
 started was the territory and the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:32.070
 story but have some things in common 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:34.980
 in block to 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.790
 as in the other has another girl 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:47.280
 in the other character that is to discover 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:49.230
 some things are quite different 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.570
 good folks these were the readings 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.440
 this month as you have seen were not 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.010
 so many 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.010
 but it was good readings and then that's it
