00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
today I'm going to show you how to use

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.949 
today I'm going to show you how to use
the<00:00:01.410> Pharaoh<00:00:01.709> on<00:00:01.920> three<00:00:02.190> easy<00:00:02.520> steps<00:00:02.959> first

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
the Pharaoh on three easy steps first

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.499 
the Pharaoh on three easy steps first
step<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.560> roll<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.250> muscles<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.240> what<00:00:06.390> you

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
step is to roll the muscles so what you

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.120 
step is to roll the muscles so what you
do<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.839> take<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.049> fair<00:00:07.410> wheel<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.950> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
do is you take the fair wheel here and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.459 
do is you take the fair wheel here and
we're<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.370> roll<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.820> entire<00:00:09.469> muscle

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
we're going to roll the entire muscle

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.009 
we're going to roll the entire muscle
group<00:00:10.920> here<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.309> loosen<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> up<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.750> warm

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
group here to loosen it up and to warm

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.910 
group here to loosen it up and to warm
it<00:00:13.139> up<00:00:14.269> what<00:00:15.269> you're<00:00:15.420> feeling<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:16.170> when

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
it up what you're feeling for when

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.760 
it up what you're feeling for when
you're<00:00:17.100> lying<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.640> are<00:00:18.600> tender<00:00:19.140> spots<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
you're lying this are tender spots and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.810 
you're lying this are tender spots and
those<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.130> trigger<00:00:20.820> points<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.449> adhesions<00:00:22.820> so

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
those are trigger points or adhesions so

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.580 
those are trigger points or adhesions so
you're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> roll<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> entire<00:00:27.590> muscle

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you're going to roll the entire muscle

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.460 
you're going to roll the entire muscle
group<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.160> feeling<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.789> hot<00:00:29.970> spots<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> I'm

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
group here feeling for hot spots so I'm

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.870 
group here feeling for hot spots so I'm
a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.769> bit<00:00:31.859> tender<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:32.550> towards<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
a little bit tender up here towards the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.190 
a little bit tender up here towards the
elbow<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.960> spot

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
elbow so I'm going to go to that spot

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
elbow so I'm going to go to that spot
i'm<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.219> either<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.090> thinner<00:00:36.780> part

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
i'm going to use either the thinner part

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190 
i'm going to use either the thinner part
or<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.160> wider<00:00:38.879> part<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> theater<00:00:40.079> where

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
or the wider part of the theater where

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.240 
or the wider part of the theater where
the<00:00:40.260> wider<00:00:40.469> part<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.100> less

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the wider part is going to be less

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010 
the wider part is going to be less
intense<00:00:41.730> i'm<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> start<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
intense i'm going to start with that and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
intense i'm going to start with that and
i'm<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.129> short<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:45.510> roles<00:00:46.640> with<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
i'm going to do short our roles with a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
i'm going to do short our roles with a
little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.390> pressure<00:00:49.520> we're<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
little bit more pressure we're going to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
little bit more pressure we're going to
hit<00:00:50.850> different<00:00:51.120> directions<00:00:51.809> we're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
hit different directions we're going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
hit different directions we're going to
go<00:00:52.170> cross<00:00:52.440> fibers<00:00:53.510> go<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.879> then

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
go cross fibers go up and down and then

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
go cross fibers go up and down and then
I<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:58.140> deeper

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I can get in there little bit deeper

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.160 
I can get in there little bit deeper
with<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.760> thinner<00:01:00.149> portion<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:01.760> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
with this this thinner portion here and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
with this this thinner portion here and
really<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.939> loosen<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.060> those

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
really get in there loosen up those

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.180 
really get in there loosen up those
muscles

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
muscles

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.670 
muscles
so<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> second<00:01:10.330> step<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.960> do<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.230> short

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
so the second step is to do the short

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.320 
so the second step is to do the short
roles<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:14.640> different<00:01:15.640> directions<00:01:15.730> with<00:01:16.300> a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
roles in different directions with a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.120 
roles in different directions with a
little<00:01:16.600> bit<00:01:16.690> more<00:01:16.810> pressure<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.530> then<00:01:18.010> the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
little bit more pressure and then the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.150 
little bit more pressure and then the
third<00:01:18.340> step<00:01:18.670> there's<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.680> concave<00:01:20.680> surface

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
third step there's a concave surface

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.430 
third step there's a concave surface
here<00:01:21.370> it<00:01:21.490> creates<00:01:21.850> an<00:01:22.000> edge<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.510> soft<00:01:22.810> edge<00:01:23.080> here

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
here it creates an edge a soft edge here

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.580 
here it creates an edge a soft edge here
that<00:01:23.620> we<00:01:23.770> can<00:01:23.920> get<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.430> separate<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.590> scar

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
that we can get in and separate the scar

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.860 
that we can get in and separate the scar
tissue<00:01:26.860> or<00:01:27.340> adhesions<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.480> get<00:01:28.660> in<00:01:28.750> between

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
tissue or adhesions and get in between

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.020 
tissue or adhesions and get in between
the<00:01:29.140> muscle<00:01:29.470> fibers<00:01:29.500> so<00:01:30.400> what<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:30.790> just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
the muscle fibers so what you do is just

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.740 
the muscle fibers so what you do is just
slightly<00:01:31.360> tilt<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.310> fair<00:01:33.610> will<00:01:33.850> we're<00:01:34.660> going

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
slightly tilt the fair will we're going

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.200 
slightly tilt the fair will we're going
to<00:01:34.840> get<00:01:35.050> in<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.560> do<00:01:35.680> short<00:01:36.130> rolls<00:01:36.550> with<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
to get in and do short rolls with the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
to get in and do short rolls with the
edge<00:01:37.420> here<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:38.800> different<00:01:39.310> directions

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
edge here in in different directions

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.000 
edge here in in different directions
maximizing<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.340> mobility<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.710> muscle

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
maximizing the mobility of that muscle

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.740 
maximizing the mobility of that muscle
group<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.490> breaking<00:01:45.910> out<00:01:46.060> any<00:01:46.330> adhesions

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
group and breaking out any adhesions

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.890 
group and breaking out any adhesions
that<00:01:47.230> may<00:01:47.950> exist<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.850> there

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.110 

so<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> summarize<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.490> steps<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.090> first

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
so to summarize three steps the first

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.600 
so to summarize three steps the first
step<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.750> long<00:01:55.080> rules<00:01:55.440> about<00:01:55.770> 10<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.220> 12<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
step is long rules about 10 to 12 of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.310 
step is long rules about 10 to 12 of
those<00:01:56.760> then<00:01:57.390> you're<00:01:57.510> going<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:57.930> short

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
those then you're going to your short

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.500 
those then you're going to your short
rolls<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> thinner<00:01:59.580> park<00:01:59.940> or

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
rolls with you to the thinner park or

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.230 
rolls with you to the thinner park or
the<00:02:00.540> wider<00:02:01.260> part<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.280> again<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.670> 10-12

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the wider part and again about 10-12

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.900 
the wider part and again about 10-12
rolls<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.260> then<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> third<00:02:04.910> step
