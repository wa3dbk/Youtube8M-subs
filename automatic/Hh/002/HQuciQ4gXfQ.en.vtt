the reason I do cardio in the morning
before<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:16.310> eat<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.359> because<00:04:17.810> at<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.230> time<00:04:18.290> i

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
before I eat is because at that time i

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.240 
before I eat is because at that time i
can<00:04:19.010> only<00:04:19.160> use<00:04:19.519> stored<00:04:20.120> body<00:04:20.269> fat<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.840> energy
