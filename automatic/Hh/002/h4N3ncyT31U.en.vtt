00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.520
 Let's now know what to watch in the sky. 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.710
 this week with the naked eye 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.350
 in the early evening you can see the planet 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.760
 Venus on the west horizon in the constellation 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.750
 of twins 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.210
 it stays visible until 20-30 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.029
 also in the beginning of the night together 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 visible to the north in the constellation of cancer 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.210
 it can be observed until 11 pm 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 remains visible throughout the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 night in the constellation of pound 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.800
 past programs we have seen that the theory 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.530
 of the general relativity of einstein 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.629
 provided a description of the phenomena 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 more accurate than the law of the 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.460
 universal gravitation of real here 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.149
 nilton the proof of the forecasts of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.630
 einstein 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.940
 during the total solar eclipse of 1919 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.020
 was a turning point in the history of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.700
 physics 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.890
 one of the most 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.020
 of relativity is the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.959
 existence of black holes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.300
 these mysterious objects are regions of the 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.990
 space where the gravitational field is so 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.550
 intense that even light can not escape 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.220
 after the theory of general relativity 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.250
 of einstein another German physicist solved 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 exploit its captive consequences 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.319
 chute got the first exact solution 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 for the field equations of the 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.940
 general relativity 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 he was able to find a solution for the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.610
 equations of the gravitational field around 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.979
 of a static spherical body in this 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.709
 solution found a distance from the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.099
 center of this body to which equations 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.420
 was finally an infinite value 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:00.050
 mathematically found a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.989
 this limiting distance is 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.239
 called x - ray and washing in which 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.420
 is the event horizon of a hole 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:11.660
 that any object with a smaller radius 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.220
 that x-ray I think until the next program 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.220
 and your books to all
