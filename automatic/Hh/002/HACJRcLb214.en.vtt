I<00:01:54.190> think<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.340> problem<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.730> we<00:01:55.910> are<00:01:56.150> having

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
I think the problem that we are having

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.380 
I think the problem that we are having
with<00:01:56.690> this<00:01:56.870> kadhi<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.710> Ella<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.060> little

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
with this kadhi is that Ella is a little

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.540 
with this kadhi is that Ella is a little
too<00:01:59.540> small<00:01:59.870> for<00:02:00.080> this<00:02:00.230> party<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:00.710> got<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.040> wide

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
base here and when she sits on it her

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.330 
base here and when she sits on it her
legs<00:02:05.720> are<00:02:05.930> all<00:02:06.110> spread<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.010> everything

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you sit down on the potty okay so as you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.350 
you sit down on the potty okay so as you
can<00:02:14.630> see<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.440> how<00:02:15.680> she<00:02:15.880> sits<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.020 
can see this is how she sits on the
potty<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.620> she<00:02:18.830> likes<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.430> she<00:02:19.880> would

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
potty but she likes I think she would

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.700 
potty but she likes I think she would
like<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.240> more<00:02:20.420> if<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.380> was<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> smaller<00:02:22.540> base

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
like it more if it was a smaller base

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.170 
like it more if it was a smaller base
here<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:25.640> I'm<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.910> try<00:02:26.120> the
