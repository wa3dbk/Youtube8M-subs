00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.270
 oh I do not believe you found out 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.070
 something to discover that the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.619
 monsters do not have the slightest regard 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.960
 with the recycling work 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.530
 When we finish the fire operation, I'm going 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.150
 have to start a campaign but I think 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.100
 Of course, I did not find him. 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.970
 Dragon so I could not know 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.199
 Nothing about her and you 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.600
 claws of the prophet 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.630
 the hit paid no attention to anything 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.460
 I said I thought I was going to distract 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.480
 I think we can get off the list of 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.059
 suspects and what exactly did you say 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.270
 I asked him what he was 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.880
 I've been doing this lately and I've tried 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.579
 discreetly get him to talk 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.350
 something that took a clue but 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.020
 I think he's done everything wrong. 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.369
 Rafael, these smart people do not think 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.619
 she would do these things is 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.930
 very concentrated in the studies 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.470
 Do you think we should take it off the list? 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.470
 of suspects 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.560
 She is very intelligent, I do not think 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.190
 we should make sure that before 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.190
 discard the possibility 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.990
 O 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 ae 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.770
 with ethical license 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.770
 the judge yells quite honestly with you 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 gaps then what do you think of 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.180
 be a new student in monster scary ray 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.150
 but it is also not exactly 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.160
 as we imagined there even though the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.350
 brain starts here you really 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.640
 It seems that everything is very strange for 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.560
 here you also realized if today I 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.540
 I was walking continue fire and she 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.240
 decided to go and talk to the director without 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.580
 head on the virus but when she 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.730
 came back it did not look the same 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.010
 it seemed that it was about 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.350
 Hypnosis hypnosis and I think it is not the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.660
 only some other students are like this 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.180
 they keep repeating things 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.280
 that Miss Dragon says so beautiful 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.380
 damn it 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.120
 hello monster to the director black gold 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.930
 asked to distribute Swiss to 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 students lectures of dredger annulled today the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.090
 the origin of the dragons by them is dragon 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.220
 it is important that students 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.390
 maturity in analogy since it is 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.550
 a matter that has been included 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.510
 recently at the time the board 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.440
 liked the idea 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.750
 I hope you, this was very strange. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.340
 I'm going to change features arrives 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.400
 of weirdness for today 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.099
 Thank you for keeping me company, is not it? 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.349
 why then did the pieces confirm the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.890
 being paid is the time to have the new 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.489
 salary and the house was always 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.489
 it was just the beginning
