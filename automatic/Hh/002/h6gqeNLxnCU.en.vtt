now<00:00:16.529> obviously<00:00:17.660> triangle<00:00:18.660> bathing<00:00:18.869> suits<00:00:19.109> are

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
now obviously triangle bathing suits are

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410 
now obviously triangle bathing suits are
very<00:00:19.289> expensive<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.520> instead<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.910> buying<00:00:21.119> one

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
very expensive but instead of buying one

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.810 
very expensive but instead of buying one
for<00:00:21.840> hundred<00:00:22.140> dollars<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.680> figured<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.400> could

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
for hundred dollars I figured I could

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
for hundred dollars I figured I could
try<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> make<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:26.070> like

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
try to make it I actually really like

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
try to make it I actually really like
the<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.609> came<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.090> almost<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:28.050> looks

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the way it came out in almost it looks

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
the way it came out in almost it looks
like<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> triangle<00:00:28.710> baby<00:00:29.130> suit<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> kind<00:00:29.699> of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
like a triangle baby suit but it kind of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.220 
like a triangle baby suit but it kind of
looks<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.090> puzzle<00:00:30.510> piece<00:00:30.660> bathing<00:00:30.929> suit

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
looks like a puzzle piece bathing suit

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
looks like a puzzle piece bathing suit
which<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:31.830> yours<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
which I really like yours is going to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.040 
which I really like yours is going to
differ<00:00:33.420> between<00:00:33.899> whatever<00:00:34.820> fabric<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
differ between whatever fabric you use I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
differ between whatever fabric you use I
used<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.469> bra<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.520> never<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.149> wore

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
used a bra that I never really wore

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.350 
used a bra that I never really wore
basically<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> bathing<00:00:40.500> suit<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
basically a bathing suit and I like the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
basically a bathing suit and I like the
style<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.309> how

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
style of that because that's really how

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
style of that because that's really how
the<00:00:44.550> triangle<00:00:44.879> bathing<00:00:45.239> suits<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.600> they're

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the triangle bathing suits are they're

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.840 
the triangle bathing suits are they're
kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.410> bra<00:00:46.649> style<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
kind of the more bra style you can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.369 
kind of the more bra style you can
always<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> bathing<00:00:48.539> suit<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> thought

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
always use a bathing suit but I thought

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
always use a bathing suit but I thought
that<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.920> worked<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> best<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.420> really

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that that worked the best I really

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
that that worked the best I really
cannot<00:00:52.530> wait<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.949> wear<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> beach<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
cannot wait to wear this to the beach I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
cannot wait to wear this to the beach I
will<00:00:54.480> probably<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.379> using<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:55.949> Japan

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
will probably be using it more Japan

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.790

braided<00:01:25.680> elastic<00:01:26.520> uh<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
braided elastic uh I don't know if it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
braided elastic uh I don't know if it
needs<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.110> braided<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.860> got<00:01:29.009> mine<00:01:29.189> at

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
needs to be braided I just got mine at

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
needs to be braided I just got mine at
Joanne's<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.659> sure<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.079> stretchy

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
Joanne's and make sure it is stretchy

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.940 
Joanne's and make sure it is stretchy
elastic<00:01:32.210> because<00:01:33.210> it'll<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.869> way<00:01:34.079> easier<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
elastic because it'll be way easier in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
elastic because it'll be way easier in
the<00:01:35.400> long<00:01:35.579> run<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.210> won't<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.600> break<00:01:36.869> off<00:01:37.079> if

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the long run it won't like break off if

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.270 
the long run it won't like break off if
you're<00:01:37.409> trying<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> put<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.009> because

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you're trying to put it on because

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
you're trying to put it on because
they'll<00:01:38.610> stretch<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:40.140> you're

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
they'll stretch with you and then you're

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
they'll stretch with you and then you're
going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> need<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.890> fabric<00:01:41.070> glue<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
going to need some fabric glue I'm just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
going to need some fabric glue I'm just
using<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.329> Scotch<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.110> make<00:01:43.320> sure<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
using the Scotch one but make sure that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.060 
using the Scotch one but make sure that
it<00:01:44.369> says<00:01:44.549> fabric<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.869> otherwise<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.829> won't

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it says fabric on it otherwise it won't

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.969 
it says fabric on it otherwise it won't
bond<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:49.140> step<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
bond very well now the first step is to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
bond very well now the first step is to
measure<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.149> last<00:01:51.360> stick<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
measure out with your last stick for the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.800 
measure out with your last stick for the
top<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.189> bra<00:01:53.549> Cup<00:01:53.909> how<00:01:54.329> much<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.689> going

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
top of the bra Cup how much you're going

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.719 
top of the bra Cup how much you're going
to<00:01:54.869> need<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.979> went<00:01:56.159> ahead<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> did

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to need so I just went ahead and did

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.500 
to need so I just went ahead and did
that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480 

so<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.750> next<00:02:05.900> step<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.620> glue<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.250> top

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so the next step is to glue the top

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.840 
so the next step is to glue the top
strip<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.570> top<00:02:08.930> of<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.320> cup<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.770> for<00:02:10.520> like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
strip to the top of the cup and for like

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.830 
strip to the top of the cup and for like
half<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.480> DIY<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.440> did<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.340> wrong<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.570> what

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
half of this DIY I did it wrong so what

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.990 
half of this DIY I did it wrong so what
you're<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.430> apply<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you're going to want to do is apply the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.050 
you're going to want to do is apply the
glue<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.110> elastic<00:02:18.740> strip<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.340> let<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.940> get

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
glue to the elastic strip and let it get

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.880 
glue to the elastic strip and let it get
tacky<00:02:20.360> for<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.840> five<00:02:21.080> minutes<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.590> what<00:02:21.740> that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
tacky for like five minutes so what that

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.010 
tacky for like five minutes so what that
means<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.640> let<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.910> sit<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.840> five

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
means is to just let it sit for five

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.810 
means is to just let it sit for five
minutes<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.590> kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.920> dry<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.580> then<00:02:25.790> apply

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
minutes and kind of dry and then apply

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.210 
minutes and kind of dry and then apply
it<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.600> sticks<00:02:27.080> way<00:02:27.350> better<00:02:27.590> but

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
it and it just sticks way better but

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.430 
it and it just sticks way better but
what<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.400> did<00:02:28.730> here<00:02:29.210> is<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.750> applied<00:02:30.020> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
what I did here is I just applied the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.240 
what I did here is I just applied the
glue<00:02:30.470> as<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.640> went<00:02:31.790> along<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.450> straight

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
glue as I went along like straight

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.950 
glue as I went along like straight
straightaway<00:02:34.250> didn't<00:02:35.060> give<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> time<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.840> get

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
straightaway didn't give it time to get

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.750 
straightaway didn't give it time to get
tacky<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.590> didn't<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.130> work<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.550> well

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
tacky so didn't really work that well

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
tacky so didn't really work that well
but<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:39.470> listen<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.400> voice<00:02:40.670> listen<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
but just listen to my voice listen to it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.470 
but just listen to my voice listen to it
just<00:02:42.050> apply<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.130> glue<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.940> elastic

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
just apply the glue it to the elastic

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.150 
just apply the glue it to the elastic
let<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.780> sit<00:02:45.020> for<00:02:45.200> five<00:02:45.350> minutes<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.830> then

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
let it sit for five minutes and then

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280 
let it sit for five minutes and then
apply<00:02:46.460> it<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.820> top<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.210> cup<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.630> your

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
apply it to the top of the cup and your

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.100 
apply it to the top of the cup and your
life<00:02:48.440> will<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.740> lot<00:02:49.100> simpler<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:55.959> then<00:02:56.959> go

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
life will be a lot simpler and then go

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.020 
life will be a lot simpler and then go
ahead<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.560> measure<00:02:57.740> out<00:02:58.010> fabric<00:02:58.520> for<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
ahead and measure out fabric for the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.270 
ahead and measure out fabric for the
bottom<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.290> cup<00:03:00.800> you're<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.160> gonna

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
bottom of the cup you're just gonna

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.060 
bottom of the cup you're just gonna
basically<00:03:01.810> essentially<00:03:02.810> at<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.650> end<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
basically essentially at the end of the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.729 
basically essentially at the end of the
day<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.670> cover<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.450> entire<00:03:05.600> cup<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
day want to cover the entire cup in a

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.060 
day want to cover the entire cup in a
black<00:03:07.489> elastic<00:03:07.989> kind<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.110> fashion<00:03:10.040> that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
black elastic kind of fashion that

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.280 
black elastic kind of fashion that
didn't<00:03:10.459> make<00:03:10.550> sense<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.300> just<00:03:11.540> watch<00:03:12.050> what

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
didn't make sense but just watch what

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.040 
didn't make sense but just watch what
I'm<00:03:12.410> doing<00:03:12.440> okay<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.780> kind<00:03:14.930> of

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
I'm doing okay and then this is kind of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.479 
I'm doing okay and then this is kind of
where<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.170> got<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> hang<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.830> letting<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> glue

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
where I got the hang of letting the glue

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.729 
where I got the hang of letting the glue
ketaki<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:17.900> apply<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.200> black<00:03:18.440> all

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
ketaki so just apply the black all

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:33.930 
ketaki so just apply the black all
around<00:03:19.130> your<00:03:19.400> bra<00:03:19.730> okay

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.300 

then<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.120> my<00:03:35.360> stick<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.800> now<00:03:36.980> you're<00:03:37.130> going<00:03:37.220> to

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
then on my stick so now you're going to

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.490 
then on my stick so now you're going to
want<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.550> measure<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.910> strip<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:38.960> right<00:03:39.200> across

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
want to measure a strip for right across

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.950 
want to measure a strip for right across
the<00:03:39.890> cup<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.370> this<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.970> old<00:03:41.180> triangle

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
the cup and this is the old triangle

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.050 
the cup and this is the old triangle
fashion<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.470> bathing<00:03:42.830> suits<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:43.640> go<00:03:43.790> ahead<00:03:43.910> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
fashion of bathing suits so go ahead and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.210 
fashion of bathing suits so go ahead and
measure<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.900> strip<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.710> is<00:03:45.950> where<00:03:46.190> I

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
measure that strip and this is where I

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.460 
measure that strip and this is where I
did<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.610> correctly<00:03:46.820> as<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.840> can<00:03:47.990> see<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.350> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
did it correctly as you can see to the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.410 
did it correctly as you can see to the
right<00:03:48.500> I'm<00:03:49.190> applying<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.910> glue<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
right I'm applying the glue to the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.030 
right I'm applying the glue to the
fabric<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.020> then<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.200> let<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.500> sit<00:03:51.710> for<00:03:51.740> like

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
fabric and then I let it sit for like

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.370 
fabric and then I let it sit for like
five<00:03:52.400> minutes<00:03:52.640> watch<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.780> youtube<00:03:54.230> video

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
five minutes watch like a youtube video

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.400 
five minutes watch like a youtube video
as<00:03:54.770> I<00:03:54.920> let<00:03:55.130> each<00:03:55.340> strip<00:03:55.760> dry<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.420> then<00:03:56.960> applied

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
as I let each strip dry and then applied

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.070 
as I let each strip dry and then applied
it<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.280> bra<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.000> look<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.570> just<00:03:59.600> made<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
it to the bra and look it just made it

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.200 
it to the bra and look it just made it
so<00:04:00.680> much<00:04:00.710> easier<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.670> just<00:04:01.880> applied<00:04:02.180> it

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
so much easier so I just applied it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.930 
so much easier so I just applied it
straight<00:04:03.200> across<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.920> middle<00:04:04.040> held<00:04:04.760> it

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
straight across to the middle held it

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.640 
straight across to the middle held it
down<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.390> two<00:04:05.660> seconds<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.470> just

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
down for like two seconds and it just

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.630 
down for like two seconds and it just
stayed<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.190> was<00:04:07.280> magic<00:04:07.760> yeah<00:04:08.680> all<00:04:09.680> right<00:04:09.890> yep

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
stayed it was magic yeah all right yep

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.600 
stayed it was magic yeah all right yep
you<00:04:10.820> get<00:04:11.000> Kenzi<00:04:11.720> okay<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.650> then<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:12.890> ahead<00:04:13.340> and

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
you get Kenzi okay and then go ahead and

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.410 
you get Kenzi okay and then go ahead and
measure<00:04:14.410> fabric<00:04:15.410> for<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:16.040> bottom<00:04:16.430> half<00:04:16.730> of

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
measure fabric for the bottom half of

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.750 
measure fabric for the bottom half of
the<00:04:17.840> path<00:04:18.500> if<00:04:18.920> that<00:04:19.190> makes<00:04:19.400> sense

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
the path if that makes sense

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.910 
the path if that makes sense
and<00:04:19.850> then<00:04:20.120> apply<00:04:20.390> glue<00:04:20.690> let<00:04:21.110> it<00:04:21.200> get<00:04:21.320> tacky<00:04:21.590> and

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
and then apply glue let it get tacky and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.310 
and then apply glue let it get tacky and
apply<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.850> there<00:04:23.420> we<00:04:23.570> go<00:04:23.780> we<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.110> a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
apply it and there we go we have a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.530 
apply it and there we go we have a
triangle<00:04:24.770> bathing<00:04:25.550> suit<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.910> can<00:04:26.060> also<00:04:26.240> add

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
triangle bathing suit you can also add

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.980 
triangle bathing suit you can also add
black<00:04:26.750> fabric<00:04:27.680> elastic<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.150> band<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.810> it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
black fabric elastic to the band of it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.870 
black fabric elastic to the band of it
but<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.230> figured<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:31.190> would<00:04:31.280> kind<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.610> rip

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
but I figured that it would kind of rip

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.880 
but I figured that it would kind of rip
off<00:04:32.060> as<00:04:32.540> I'm<00:04:32.990> trying<00:04:33.170> to<00:04:33.290> put<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:33.860> just

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
off as I'm trying to put it on so I just

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.830 
off as I'm trying to put it on so I just
didn't<00:04:34.190> even<00:04:34.220> bother<00:04:34.490> but<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> love<00:04:35.540> how<00:04:35.720> this
