is a round nose that I got really nice
it's<00:00:36.360> probably<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.829> shorter

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

but I am putting an 18 in it and the 18

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
but I am putting an 18 in it and the 18
will<00:00:45.960> fit<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:47.100> good<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
will fit pretty good it's just it it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.869 
will fit pretty good it's just it it
just<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> hall<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just it was just the hall that's all I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
just it was just the hall that's all I
got<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:55.739> putting<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> in

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
got with it and so I'm putting that in

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
got with it and so I'm putting that in
this<00:00:56.579> thing<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.940> probably<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> rocket

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
this thing will probably be a rocket

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.889 
this thing will probably be a rocket
because<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> fast<00:01:00.829> miss<00:01:01.829> Vegas<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.550> fast

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
because this is fast miss Vegas is fast

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
because this is fast miss Vegas is fast
so<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.100> working<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
so that other one so I'm working on that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.490 
so that other one so I'm working on that

the<00:03:00.269> laser<00:03:00.510> cutting<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.819> nice

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the laser cutting is so nice

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.940 
the laser cutting is so nice
very<00:03:05.459> little<00:03:05.790> sanding<00:03:06.359> you<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.560> take<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
very little sanding you have to take the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.759 
very little sanding you have to take the
the<00:03:08.489> little<00:03:08.730> rivets<00:03:09.180> or<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.659> little<00:03:09.930> bumps

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
the little rivets or the little bumps

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.009 
the little rivets or the little bumps
out<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.299> where<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.470> laser<00:03:14.599> stops<00:03:15.599> I

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
out of the where the the laser stops I

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.409 
out of the where the the laser stops I
think<00:03:16.079> that's<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.500> right<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.859> maybe<00:03:17.159> not<00:03:17.519> but

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
think that's the right one maybe not but
