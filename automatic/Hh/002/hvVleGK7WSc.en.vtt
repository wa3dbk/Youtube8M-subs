00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.170 
little bit of the hop by there but not
not<00:02:37.150> as<00:02:37.270> pronounced<00:02:37.750> as<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.850> would<00:02:39.970> like

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
not as pronounced as I as I would like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.070 
not as pronounced as I as I would like
to<00:02:40.450> be<00:02:40.540> honest<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.930> am<00:02:41.250> hmm<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:43.270> very<00:02:43.540> sweet<00:02:43.870> on

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
to be honest I am hmm it's very sweet on

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.540 
to be honest I am hmm it's very sweet on
getting<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.410> multi<00:02:44.800> sweetness<00:02:45.340> come

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
getting that multi sweetness come

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.180 
getting that multi sweetness come
through<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.690> pronounced<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
through and that's pronounced the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.670 
through and that's pronounced the
bitterness<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.850> not<00:02:49.300> much<00:02:49.540> at<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.840> only<00:02:50.560> a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
bitterness is not much at all only a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.800 
bitterness is not much at all only a
little<00:02:50.920> bit<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.160> bitterness<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:52.360> taste<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
little bit of bitterness I can taste the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.770 
little bit of bitterness I can taste the
hops<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.260> there<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.970> actual<00:02:55.210> bitterness

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
hops in there but the actual bitterness

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.670 
hops in there but the actual bitterness
on<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.020> palate<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.470> not<00:02:56.710> much<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:59.020> it's<00:02:59.410> very

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
on the palate is not much but it's very

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.949 
on the palate is not much but it's very
nice<00:02:59.860> I'll<00:03:00.100> just<00:03:00.250> give<00:03:00.430> us<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.580> mall

of<00:04:05.870> people<00:04:06.140> probably<00:04:06.260> have<00:04:06.440> formed<00:04:06.799> their<00:04:06.860> own

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
of people probably have formed their own

of people probably have formed their own
opinions<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:07.900> for<00:04:08.900> me<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.910> was<00:04:10.910> thinking<00:04:11.239> of

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
opinions on it for me I was thinking of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.880 
opinions on it for me I was thinking of
seven<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.110> I'm<00:04:12.170> not<00:04:12.260> giving<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.590> seven

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
seven but I think I'm not giving a seven

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.580 
seven but I think I'm not giving a seven
a<00:04:12.980> half<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.940> due<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.450> how<00:04:14.780> refreshing<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.440> is

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
a half just due to how refreshing it is

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.189 
a half just due to how refreshing it is
if<00:04:16.100> you're<00:04:16.280> really<00:04:16.549> thirsty<00:04:17.049> seven<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.169> a

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
if you're really thirsty seven and a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.830 
if you're really thirsty seven and a
half<00:04:18.229> out<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.650> ten<00:04:18.919> for<00:04:19.160> Beck's

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
half out of ten for Beck's

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.900 
half out of ten for Beck's
it's<00:04:20.840> not<00:04:21.019> gonna<00:04:21.169> blow<00:04:21.320> your<00:04:21.500> mind<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.760> hop

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
it's not gonna blow your mind the hop

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.820 
it's not gonna blow your mind the hop
bitterness<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.720> not<00:04:23.990> very<00:04:24.200> much<00:04:24.380> at<00:04:24.530> all<00:04:24.620> for

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
bitterness is not very much at all for

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.960 
bitterness is not very much at all for
me

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
me

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.879 
me
but<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.630> is<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.139> brewed<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.500> Germany

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
but this is the one brewed in Germany

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.379 
but this is the one brewed in Germany
and<00:04:28.010> it's<00:04:28.130> much<00:04:28.400> much<00:04:28.639> better<00:04:28.850> than<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> stuff

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
and it's much much better than the stuff

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.909 
and it's much much better than the stuff
I<00:04:29.510> was<00:04:29.570> getting<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.320> was<00:04:30.440> brewed<00:04:30.650> here<00:04:30.680> on

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
I was getting that was brewed here on

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.270 
I was getting that was brewed here on
the<00:04:31.040> license<00:04:31.400> much<00:04:31.639> better<00:04:32.350> so<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.160> can

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the license much better so if you can

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.610 
the license much better so if you can
pick<00:04:34.430> up<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.700> stuff<00:04:35.240> from<00:04:35.419> from<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:36.200> Germany

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
pick up the stuff from from in Germany

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.060 
pick up the stuff from from in Germany
go<00:04:37.190> for<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.490> because<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:38.090> does<00:04:38.620> adhere<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.950> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
go for it because it does adhere to the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
go for it because it does adhere to the
German<00:04:41.030> purity<00:04:41.539> law<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:43.130> can't<00:04:43.370> have<00:04:43.910> had

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
German purity law so it can't have had

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.760 
German purity law so it can't have had
jumps<00:04:44.389> in<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.600> I<00:04:44.750> research<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.620> though

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
jumps in it I research that though

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.840 
jumps in it I research that though
because<00:04:45.949> I<00:04:46.190> believe<00:04:46.460> there's<00:04:46.699> some

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
because I believe there's some

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.540 
because I believe there's some
flexibility<00:04:47.360> with<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:47.720> law<00:04:47.900> now<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:49.010> I'm<00:04:49.100> not

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
flexibility with that law now so I'm not

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.950 
flexibility with that law now so I'm not
too<00:04:49.699> sure<00:04:49.940> whether<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.449> can<00:04:50.510> add<00:04:50.750> some

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
too sure whether they can add some

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.190 
too sure whether they can add some
adjuncts<00:04:51.650> but<00:04:52.360> as<00:04:53.360> far<00:04:53.630> as<00:04:53.750> I'm<00:04:53.840> aware<00:04:53.960> they

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200
