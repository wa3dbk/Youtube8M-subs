 each new game diverge 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 multimillion copies and details 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.309
 about the new part cause more excitement 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.080
 than other releases 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 but as we know it today 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.340
 the series was not immediately but only with the release 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.340
 third part but first things first 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.160
 scottish studio idea my design was 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.170
 founded in 1988 the first time 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.890
 developers from edinburgh created games 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.660
 for computers commodore 64 and amiko 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.560
 The most successful project of the company has become 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.570

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.430
 released first granted to the almost 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.840
 without plot thriller about the daring 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.640
 car thieves with top view 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.790
 a year later the studio finished work on 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.430
 body harvest for nintendo 64 type 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.680
 future three dimensional is the main character 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.360
 traveled the open world fought 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 with aliens and could ride 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.150
 variety of vehicles 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.150
 familiar sounds 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.680
 ninety-ninth year dm e design 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.710
 introduced two games of the gta series at once 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.470
 supplement london 1969 and full 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.750
 the second part of the gameplay basis 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.920
 Scottish did not change but did it 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.900
 much more diverse 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.700
 now we could work on one of 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.220
 several bank appeared additional 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.690
 missions and city residents began to actively 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.060
 respond to our actions 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.730
 the game was popular but up 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.070
 this series of triumph still remained 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.150
 a couple of years 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.490
 great success came to the show 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.800
 after milenium already in the era of the new 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.479
 generation of consoles when the show moved 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.940
 in 3d 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.640
 grand theft auto 3 was released in October 2001 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.170
 years on playstation 2 and immediately sold out 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.869
 colossal circulation 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.180
 later it ported on puss sex boxing and 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.100
 these versions are even rapidly dismantled with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.420
 store shelves 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.150
 overestimate the impact of the project on the game 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.550
 the industry is difficult although the sandbox came out 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.740
 and before it was the third part of this was 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.170
 a landmark pattern of militants with an open 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.720
 peace we acted as a robber 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.459
 banks named claude sleep but in those 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.370
 times the hero was looking nameless 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.380
 he was betrayed by his girlfriend because of her 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 Claude lost all the money and fell into the hands 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.150
 the police but thanks to luck 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.760
 circumstances the fleet managed to free themselves 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.340
 and he started from scratch a long and dangerous 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.140
 criminal career at first 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
 was engaged in any nonsense like delivery 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.760
 small gangsters and lung girls 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.590
 behavior but gradually gained confidence 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.410
 criminal bosses going to more 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.940
 serious assignment and eventually achieved 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.390
 fame and fortune 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.260
 but at the same time revenge ex- girlfriend 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.630
 history did not differ originality 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.060
 which, however, was fully compensated 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.730
 great videos and chic voice acting 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.580
 but the incredible trump card 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.370
 player freedom was left alone with 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.739
 huge city alive 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.120
 epam with a lot of different tasks for 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.519
 the game could spend a few 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.310
 dozens of hours during this time without passing 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.129
 one story mission today we are to this 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.650
 already accustomed to but in 2001 the awareness 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.370
 the fact that you are your own boss in what 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.370
 beyond 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.260
 events unfolded in the city 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.459
 liberty city whose prototype 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.500
 served new york 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.959
 virtual metropolis area 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.849
 made unthinkable for those times 5 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.640
 square miles the city is really 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.859
 turned out huge and very diverse 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.870
 there were areas with skyscrapers and 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.239
 low-rise building park 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.879
 industrial zones metro airport and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.639
 abandoned tunnels giant expanse 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.799
 to explore the game world smashed into 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.959
 three major regions and new locations 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.170
 opened as you progress through the storyline 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.090
 missions well, very clever players managed 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.859
 overcome artificial limitations and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.319
 early to get on closed 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.299
 territory and learn secrets 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.259
 liberty city was just as exciting 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.259
 how to perform tasks 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.570
 let's say one of the inaccessible areas 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.520
 card was the so-called 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.560
 abandoned town a couple of blocks 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.170
 specially created by developers for 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.510
 introductory video this area more 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.160
 nowhere used but authors still 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.680
 left him in the game world 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.190
 particularly resourceful players could get 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.910
 there by plane yes yes 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.090
 the developers have provided players 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.110
 enviable freedom of creativity with 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.030
 I enjoyed it and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.760
 started to invent new ones for themselves 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.800
 entertainment in the world gta3 for example 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.450
 competed who will last no longer 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.060
 fell into the hands of the authorities when in the city 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.310
 martial law declared or 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.140
 performed crazy tricks with springboards and 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.920
 bragged about their skill before 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.920
 other fans 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.950
 And the computer version in addition 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.200
 I got a lot of mods 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.090
 enthusiasts spent car parameters 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.980
 let's say police cars could 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.080
 to drive the walls and carriages 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.830
 ambulance overclock to 500 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.260
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.150
 another important feature of the third part 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.510
 steel references to our reality 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.370
 black humor and caustic satire game quite 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.920
 can be perceived as quite adult 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.330
 mature social parody worth 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.180
 recall at least local radio stations 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.230
 twist lice and talk shows and mad advertising 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.230
 non existing goods 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.330
 the game was full of fun 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.880
 Scene with stinging jokes and 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.610
 cultural allusions balancing on 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.740
 the brink it coupled with the highest level 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.600
 violence made granted to the three 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.360
 favorite target for fighters with 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.450
 cruelty time for them in the game was enough 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.440
 causing episodes fathers holy only 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.660
 think 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.940
 here you can rent a prostitute 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.490
 use the whole range of services 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.650
 and then have five and raise money or 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.460
 play maniac shooting from 2 nato honey 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.030
 on crowds of people 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.200
 what is this going on then the game itself 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.210
 blamed for all the troubles 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.120
 children shot at daddy's cars 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.380
 shotgun blame gta 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.790
 teenager dragged school machine 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.340
 blame boats 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.280
 but a few loud scandals and 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:43.880
 the courts did not prevent the success of the game even 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.950
 on the contrary, shortly after the release, studio dm e 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.140
 design changed name to a rockstar 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.900
 new and began to develop ideas 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.940
 laid down in the third part 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.680
 then numerous 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.830
 the continuation of the series success 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.470
 and gta3 itself has been republished many times 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.200
 new platforms so for the 10th anniversary of the day 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.030
 release and and ported under ios and android 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.200
 and last September she got to 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.960
 playstation 3 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.300
 the third most significant part for the series 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.180
 grant this is teasing time after time 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.170
 competitors enviable longevity and yet 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.170
 not going to leave
