00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 the first goalkeeper wins is not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.650
 a big surprise that it's you 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 otherwise it's deserved benjamin six communes 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.100
 who voted for me who does not give it to me 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.340
 it's for me for my father is going to be 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.340
 happy 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.630
 I have never dreamed of becoming 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.309
 football professional footballer it's 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.650
 a combination of circumstances that made 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.230
 that here I was lucky to make a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.830
 internship with with the louvière with 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.830
 pure soul sir 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.550
 when the news is still in division 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 2 and at that time monday virgin where is 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.290
 the final rate of for goes up in division 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.690
 1 and I was lucky what is 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.100
 list I signed to be in division 2 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.060
 here I am in division 1 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.890
 and it was soon enough for me 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.610
 I learned with michel piersoul he told me 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.110
 formed and a two years after where a year and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.460
 half after I had the opportunity to 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.070
 play my first game because the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.229
 first guard he was hurt and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.090
 so I played a match with with 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 daniel leclercq 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.640
 then it was his last match 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.180
 unfortunately we call a match 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.259
 guingamp 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 I go back this Saturday it was my 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.920
 first game we lost there 2 1 if 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.650
 my memories are good 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.720
 and then ariël jacobs arrived I 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 played a cup game of belgium where I 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.130
 I managed well and he me I him 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.420
 have a lot because lima he made me 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.190
 trust and he told me that I was going 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 stay in the goal at the beginning of my 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.229
 career there were really three 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.460
 people who have been really 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.550
 important to me 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.690
 jeff lecomte michel lepire soul and ariel 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.630
 jacobs is what is what is the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 people who trusted me so 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.090
 it's not easy to do 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.090
 trust a young guardian 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.129
 we won the belgium prize so there 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.310
 I had a feeling of having won the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.860
 belgian cup with beer being 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.030
 half useless and being quite 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.030
 useful with with anne to the east 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.380
 I think I have to be the guardians 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.110
 one of the fastest guards yes and 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.680
 it's also the moment the moment of the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.940
 decision which is important what you 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.860
 can be fast but if you take a 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 decision a little too late or you hesitate 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.900
 a little is often said to follow 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.370
 his first intuition so went that a 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.520
 once I read I have to go I'm going 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.570
 but sometimes it's very risky I try 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 always to be the cleanest for 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.940
 target in my interventions or not 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.210
 it's not easy either for 10 years 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.390
 tenderly in a paschal duel and if you 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.210
 go too softly you can you that 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.620
 the attacker can pass in front of you and 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.310
 not a little harder maybe you 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.310
 will have it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.000
 my live tour was a bit of a 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.939
 little weird I got here have a 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.390
 little like as I explained with with 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.260
 the louvière where 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.640
 daniel zitka had done all the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.550
 preparation so I arrive a little bit 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.290
 end of preparation we play a match 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.010
 everyone knows a little context 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.040
 particular 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.209
 and then here I am playing a big game of 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.860
 champion's league against betis 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.840
 seville and from that moment on I 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.300
 play everything and then I made myself 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.239
 cruciate ligaments of the knee 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.739
 a big danesi operation to play 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.459
 one of his best seasons during 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 that I was hurt 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.450
 and then here I am on the bench 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.229
 logically because here I do not 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.459
 could not claim anything other than 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.910
 to be on the bench since zitka was doing 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.190
 his matches and then I go to the gba or 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.630
 do not hide the fact that the hours and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.870
 days before leaving I was a little 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.100
 little in one in a state where I say to myself I 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.290
 wondering if it was really the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
 good thing party to the bar and then 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.200
 I was welcomed to have by 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.710
 people like worse thyssen coach 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.970
 extraordinary guard who me 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.470
 give back pleasure a little bit of everything 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.639
 to work because when you 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.729
 work that you are on the wind 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.080
 you have a little bitter taste but 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.110
 when you work to play the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.880
 good weekend that's it's sketching 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.580
 consider missing I found them the 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.919
 bao 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.330
 robert scott i made good matches 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.889
 also so for trust it's 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.110
 important and in addition during this 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.039
 period there that it marks a goal one gets 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.800
 remember it's khalilou fadiga 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.689
 fadiga who made me the maquis gave me 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.789
 the assist was the first time 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.620
 I have a head on a corner I saw the 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.199
 balloon arrive 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.820
 little is happening and I had the good 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.160
 go the right whim and who did 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:20.160
 finally a little luck as never before 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.160
 perfectly and that yorkville his boat 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.889
 yes I evolved as a man and in 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.229
 as a player also these voices I 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.869
 am more the same player happily 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.340
 that I still a little progressed my 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:38.990
 injury still delayed me and 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.860
 go I could not progress as I 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.180
 wanted in certain areas 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.250
 now a lot of people have forgotten 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.070
 is that before we talk about some 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.650
 guardians abroad this one was on 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.830
 proto to be with whom and arsenal 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.810
 also there were quite a few clubs that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.250
 wanted if he should be I'm 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.840
 remember that at the time my old 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.840
 manager makes the trip to barcelona 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.480
 - you know today I'm happy 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.510
 so I do not regret what happened 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.510
 past 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.909
 you do not hide that that's the job 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:32.660
 all value is one of the trades the 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.160
 most beautiful of the world 1 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.590
 there are sacrifices to be made but a 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.750
 once we get used to it we know a 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.760
 lifestyle I hope to play the most 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.860
 long time possible and as long as I have 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.240
 the will and the envied to do it and I 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.130
 feel good I 'll try to do it the 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.810
 Longer 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.080
 I loved printing the pressure of 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.970
 matches the pressure not to do 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.370
 an error the pressure it is internal 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.050
 and that the victory that often takes 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.780
 I love playing all kinds of games 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.850
 did even with my children my wife I 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.460
 am a super bad loser i hate 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.440
 lose and go when I'm doing a good 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.430
 match I tell you fast enough and when I 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.170
 make a bad match I say I'm going 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.490
 strongly that the next match is coming 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.320
 for directly interhuman in the 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.780
 down and as we said play three 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.090
 matches a week for me that's what 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.280
 I prefer because this is the season 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.840
 gone at an incredible speed is a 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.840
 not feel too easy there to fatigue 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.100
 last question what can 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.460
 prevent the sporting tying for 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.460
 this season 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:35.930
 ourselves because if we have the right 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.009
 good state of mind the envy the good 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.719
 mentality and 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.610
 want to help his teammate who does 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:43.379
 an error I think we have big 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.869
 chances of being champion though 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.460
 everyone plays for for his head or power 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:49.550
 transfer there is a risk of having 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.550
 problems
