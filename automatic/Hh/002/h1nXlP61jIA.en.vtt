00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
cool looks different than I guess I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.080 
cool looks different than I guess I
don't<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:34.950> why<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.220> aim<00:03:35.550> down<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.000> that

guy's<00:03:36.270> head<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.870> guess<00:03:37.770> we'll<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.370> to

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
guy's head but I guess we'll have to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.670 
guy's head but I guess we'll have to
find<00:03:38.700> out<00:03:39.270> whether<00:03:40.080> it's<00:03:40.290> good<00:03:40.440> or<00:03:40.470> not<00:03:40.590> I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
find out whether it's good or not I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720 
find out whether it's good or not I
think<00:03:40.920> it's<00:03:41.010> gonna<00:03:41.130> be<00:03:41.190> good<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.370> lot<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.610> people

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
think it's gonna be good a lot of people
