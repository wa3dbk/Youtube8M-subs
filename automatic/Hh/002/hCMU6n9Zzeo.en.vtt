00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it today here and I'll just get started

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.319 
it today here and I'll just get started
you<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> place<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.079> card<00:00:49.399> into<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> screen

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you see I place a card into the screen

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
you see I place a card into the screen
onto<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.960> screen<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.309> monster

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
onto the screen here and a monster

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
onto the screen here and a monster
instantiates<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:56.039> actually

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
instantiates and now I can actually

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.020 
instantiates and now I can actually
interact<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.239> card

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 

and<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.840> end<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and you can end this this is what the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.620 
and you can end this this is what the
idea<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.190> this<00:01:05.369> yet<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.090> also<00:01:06.210> move<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
idea is this yet if you can also move it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.930 
idea is this yet if you can also move it
around<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.080> tracks<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.560> card<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.010> 3d<00:01:08.430> I'll

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
around it tracks the card in 3d I'll

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.450 
around it tracks the card in 3d I'll
move<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.299> card<00:01:09.570> over<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> have

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
move this card over here so that I have

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
move this card over here so that I have
some<00:01:11.640> room<00:01:12.049> place<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.259> another<00:01:13.530> card<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
some room place down another card and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
some room place down another card and
this<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.710> also<00:01:16.860> instantiate<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> monster

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this will also instantiate a monster

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
this will also instantiate a monster
each<00:01:18.180> card<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.540> unique<00:01:18.869> identifier<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
each card has unique identifier so it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.130 
each card has unique identifier so it
can<00:01:20.460> tell<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.600> monster<00:01:21.990> will

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
can tell you which monster will

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.280 
can tell you which monster will
instantiate<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.550> make<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.880> card

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
instantiate and now I can make this card

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.609 
instantiate and now I can make this card
attack<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> other<00:01:25.619> monster<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> I'll<00:01:28.409> place

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
attack the other monster and I'll place

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
attack the other monster and I'll place
another<00:01:28.649> card<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.520> move<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.149> back<00:01:30.330> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
another card here move this one back a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.419 
another card here move this one back a
little<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:31.310> place<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:34.429> wait

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
little bit place this one in here wait

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.530 
little bit place this one in here wait
for<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> instantiate

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.080 

yeah<00:01:42.900> so

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.459 

so<00:01:48.090> there's<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.420> sorts<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> combinations<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
so there's all sorts of combinations you

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.840 
so there's all sorts of combinations you
could<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.219> different<00:01:50.490> cards

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
could have with all the different cards

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
could have with all the different cards
you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.179> imagine<00:01:51.359> with<00:01:52.049> 100<00:01:52.859> cards<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.219> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you can imagine with 100 cards you get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
you can imagine with 100 cards you get
millions<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> combinations<00:01:54.420> well<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.289> think

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
millions of combinations well I think

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.370 
millions of combinations well I think
one<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.579> combinations<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> cards<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.140> i

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
one of the combinations of cards that i

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
one of the combinations of cards that i
have<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> boss<00:01:59.399> character<00:01:59.909> card

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
have is probably the boss character card

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.569 
have is probably the boss character card
so<00:02:00.450> together<00:02:01.319> you<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.859> some<00:02:02.009> special<00:02:02.399> car

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
so together you have some special car

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
so together you have some special car
you<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> special<00:02:03.509> power<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.960> card<00:02:03.990> just

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you have the special power up card just

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.630 
you have the special power up card just
specially<00:02:04.950> made<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.429> demonstration

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
specially made for this demonstration

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.960 
specially made for this demonstration
let<00:02:06.209> me<00:02:06.530> put<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.709> down<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
let me put that down and see what that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.120 
let me put that down and see what that
does<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.479> demonstration

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.170 

hey

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.170 

now<00:02:20.750> that's<00:02:21.019> what<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.290> call<00:02:21.409> a<00:02:21.650> duck<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.849> you<00:02:29.030> can

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
now that's what I call a duck so you can
