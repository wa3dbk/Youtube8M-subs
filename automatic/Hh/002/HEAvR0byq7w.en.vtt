00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
to the soil and this soil is already

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.800 
to the soil and this soil is already
pretty<00:01:36.079> good<00:01:36.349> it's<00:01:36.829> really<00:01:37.189> dark<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:37.810> rich

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
but these are these leaves will break

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.629 
but these are these leaves will break
down<00:01:42.889> really<00:01:43.429> slow<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:44.990> continually

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
down really slow and just continually

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
it in with the top layers so it's adding

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.049 
it in with the top layers so it's adding
mulch<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.169> the<00:02:00.259> soil<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.429> some<00:02:01.909> nutrients

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.059 
mulch to the soil and some nutrients

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.760 
mulch to the soil and some nutrients
I've<00:02:05.059> done<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.479> disc<00:02:05.719> there<00:02:05.989> I've<00:02:06.590> got
