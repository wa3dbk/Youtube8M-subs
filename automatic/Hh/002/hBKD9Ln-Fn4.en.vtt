we're gonna bend this out into kind of a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.110 
we're gonna bend this out into kind of a
straight<00:00:53.760> line<00:00:55.190> straight<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
straight line straight as you can get it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290 
straight line straight as you can get it
does<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.050> perfect<00:00:59.300> that's

does not have to be perfect that's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
does not have to be perfect that's
probably<00:01:00.660> good<00:01:00.899> enough<00:01:01.160> you're<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.280> want

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
probably good enough you're gonna want

probably good enough you're gonna want
to<00:01:02.579> bend<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> end<00:01:03.059> over<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> bit<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> handle

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
to bend the end over a bit for a handle

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.600 
to bend the end over a bit for a handle
and<00:01:08.060> then<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> end<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and then for the end here you want to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
and then for the end here you want to
keep<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> part<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.630> cut<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.430> but

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
keep this part don't cut it off but

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
keep this part don't cut it off but
we're<00:01:14.549> gonna<00:01:14.670> need<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> bend<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> end<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
we're gonna need to bend the end of it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.719 
we're gonna need to bend the end of it
so<00:01:17.280> steel<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:17.820> fit<00:01:18.090> snugger<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.490> bend

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so steel will fit snugger so just bend

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.190 
so steel will fit snugger so just bend
that<00:01:26.790> end<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.750> bent<00:01:28.380> mine<00:01:28.560> quite<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> bit

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
that end a bit I bent mine quite a bit

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.109 
that end a bit I bent mine quite a bit
maybe<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.530> smaller<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:36.570> felt<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
maybe a bit smaller so I felt like that

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
maybe a bit smaller so I felt like that
so<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.350> put<00:01:40.500> your
