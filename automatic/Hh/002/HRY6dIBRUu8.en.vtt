effort into eating right that's why I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.719 
effort into eating right that's why I
talk<00:01:24.560> about<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.950> eating<00:01:25.100> system<00:01:25.400> that

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
talk about the eating system that

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.000 
talk about the eating system that
created<00:01:26.060> zero<00:01:26.450> willpower<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.229> eating<00:01:27.799> system

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
created zero willpower and eating system

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.530 
created zero willpower and eating system
right<00:01:28.370> so<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.549> could<00:01:28.729> forget<00:01:29.180> all<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.360> stuff

right so I could forget all that stuff
well<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:31.130> don't<00:01:31.340> need<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:31.909> much<00:01:32.150> protein<00:01:32.690> to

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
well you don't need that much protein to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.380 
well you don't need that much protein to
go<00:01:33.320> ahead<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:33.920> build<00:01:34.159> muscle<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:35.030> know<00:01:35.180> if

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
go ahead and build muscle you know if

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.330 
go ahead and build muscle you know if
you<00:01:35.479> go<00:01:35.630> with<00:01:35.750> one<00:01:35.780> gram<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.560> protein<00:01:36.680> per

me<00:03:49.060> pretty<00:03:49.480> high<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.840> next<00:03:50.050> protein<00:03:50.410> source<00:03:50.680> is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
me pretty high so next protein source is

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.120 
me pretty high so next protein source is
a<00:03:50.980> protocol<00:03:51.730> seitan<00:03:52.360> or<00:03:52.630> like<00:03:53.500> veggie<00:03:53.709> burgers

seitan is actually pretty new to me but

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.930 
seitan is actually pretty new to me but
they're<00:03:55.840> both<00:03:56.050> like<00:03:56.470> meat<00:03:56.800> substitutes<00:03:57.430> so

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
they're both like meat substitutes so

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.280 
they're both like meat substitutes so
they<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.180> come<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.570> meaty<00:03:58.810> type<00:03:59.140> of

they have come like a meaty type of

I<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.380> veggie<00:04:17.560> burgers<00:04:17.890> in<00:04:18.010> past<00:04:18.220> I

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
I think the veggie burgers in past I

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.310 
I think the veggie burgers in past I
haven't<00:04:18.489> tried<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.730> seitan<00:04:19.180> yet<00:04:19.419> but<00:04:19.690> they

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
haven't tried to seitan yet but they

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.170 
haven't tried to seitan yet but they
both<00:04:20.500> taste<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:20.979> meat<00:04:21.160> they're<00:04:21.669> really<00:04:21.940> good

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
both taste like meat they're really good

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.760 
both taste like meat they're really good
and<00:04:22.450> plus

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
and plus

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.050 
and plus
for<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.009> veggie<00:04:23.160> burgers<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.669> I've<00:04:23.759> done<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
for the veggie burgers but I've done the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.820 
for the veggie burgers but I've done the
passes<00:04:24.449> I'll<00:04:24.569> slap<00:04:24.870> off<00:04:25.080> two<00:04:25.379> or<00:04:25.560> three

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
passes I'll slap off two or three

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.279 
passes I'll slap off two or three
patties<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.550> I'll<00:04:26.699> get<00:04:26.910> 20<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.509> 30<00:04:27.900> grams<00:04:28.169> of

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
patties so I'll get 20 to 30 grams of

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.960 
patties so I'll get 20 to 30 grams of
protein<00:04:28.349> not<00:04:29.220> too<00:04:29.490> bad

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
protein not too bad

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.490 
protein not too bad
all<00:04:30.060> right<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.389> next<00:04:30.449> protein<00:04:30.960> source<00:04:31.199> is

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
all right so the next protein source is

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.219 
all right so the next protein source is
tenpai<00:04:32.159> and<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:33.060> one's<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.509> b2<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.080> what

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
tenpai and this one's you to b2 so what

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.469 
tenpai and this one's you to b2 so what
it<00:04:34.319> is<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.650> basically<00:04:34.830> soybeans<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.819> are

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
it is is basically soybeans that are

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.740 
it is is basically soybeans that are
rounded<00:04:37.259> up<00:04:37.409> into<00:04:38.039> a<00:04:38.069> patty<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.789> about<00:04:39.720> a

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
rounded up into a patty and about a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.480 
rounded up into a patty and about a
hundred<00:04:39.990> grams<00:04:40.379> of<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.710> or<00:04:40.949> basically<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
hundred grams of this or basically a

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.580 
hundred grams of this or basically a
little<00:04:41.610> less<00:04:41.819> than<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.090> cup<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.569> volume<00:04:43.020> has

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
little less than a cup and volume has

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.309 
little less than a cup and volume has
about<00:04:44.009> 18<00:04:44.639> grams<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.300> protein<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.900> taste<00:04:46.169> of

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
about 18 grams of protein the taste of

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.680 
about 18 grams of protein the taste of
it<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.680> would<00:04:47.039> say<00:04:47.190> try<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.639> out<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.389> can

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
it I would say try it out and you can

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.119 
it I would say try it out and you can
let<00:04:48.870> me<00:04:48.900> know<00:04:49.020> how<00:04:49.289> that<00:04:49.470> tastes<00:04:49.680> I've<00:04:49.919> never

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
let me know how that tastes I've never
