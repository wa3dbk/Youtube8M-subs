is<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.920> huge<00:02:39.190> number<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.900> course<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.410> the

is a huge number of course one of the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.050 
great things besides the fuel economy of
course<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.629> diesel<00:02:43.900> czar<00:02:45.060> long-living

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
course is that diesel czar long-living

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580 
course is that diesel czar long-living
and<00:02:46.480> they're<00:02:46.750> relatively<00:02:47.080> low<00:02:47.349> maintenance

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
and they're relatively low maintenance

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.229 
and they're relatively low maintenance
they're<00:02:48.370> done<00:02:48.519> right<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.060> are<00:02:49.120> no

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
they're done right because there are no

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.960 
they're done right because there are no
spark<00:02:49.510> plugs<00:02:49.750> obviously<00:02:50.319> right<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.640> what<00:02:51.790> kind

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
spark plugs obviously right so what kind

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.559 
spark plugs obviously right so what kind
of<00:02:52.030> life<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.300> expect<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.780> get<00:02:52.900> position<00:02:54.569> we're

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569

of life you expect to get position we're
around<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.530> don't<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.099> if<00:02:57.160> we<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.459> an<00:02:57.580> exact

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
around I don't know if we have an exact

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.119 
around I don't know if we have an exact
number<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.660> both<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.590> one<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
number that is both but one of the

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.790 
number that is both but one of the
things<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.000> car

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
things on this car

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.430 
things on this car
with<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.610> deaf<00:03:03.880> system<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.510> 10,000<00:03:05.110> miles<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
with the deaf system the 10,000 miles I

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.960 
with the deaf system the 10,000 miles I
mentioned<00:03:05.800> that's<00:03:05.920> approximately<00:03:06.400> your

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
mentioned that's approximately your

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.460 
mentioned that's approximately your
world<00:03:07.150> change

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
world change

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
world change
so<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.130> really<00:03:09.460> don't<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.630> first

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
so you really don't have the first

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.960 
so you really don't have the first
10,000<00:03:11.500> miles<00:03:11.740> which<00:03:12.280> are<00:03:12.430> covered<00:03:12.790> by<00:03:12.910> the

you know that's what we had to do here
to<00:06:38.270> to<00:06:38.479> to<00:06:39.319> do<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:39.889> acoustic<00:06:40.369> treatment<00:06:40.819> and

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:40.999 
to to to do the acoustic treatment and

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.239 
to to to do the acoustic treatment and
make<00:06:41.180> it<00:06:41.389> so<00:06:41.869> that<00:06:41.899> the<00:06:42.289> US<00:06:42.559> consumer<00:06:43.069> who's

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
make it so that the US consumer who's

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.939 
make it so that the US consumer who's
not<00:06:43.430> used<00:06:43.639> to<00:06:43.789> Diesel's<00:06:44.209> has<00:06:45.110> maybe<00:06:45.559> a<00:06:45.709> bad

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
not used to Diesel's has maybe a bad

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.540 
not used to Diesel's has maybe a bad
memory<00:06:46.189> of<00:06:46.459> diesel<00:06:46.879> spent<00:06:47.240> many<00:06:48.020> years<00:06:48.139> ago

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
memory of diesel spent many years ago

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.519 
memory of diesel spent many years ago
maybe<00:06:49.550> their<00:06:49.819> social<00:06:50.240> days<00:06:50.419> those<00:06:51.169> days<00:06:51.379> are

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529

same six-speed transmission this

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.269 
same six-speed transmission this
actually<00:07:14.899> is<00:07:15.019> a<00:07:15.050> unique<00:07:15.349> transition<00:07:15.949> just<00:07:16.069> for

yeah<00:07:20.220> well<00:07:20.370> they<00:07:20.460> really<00:07:20.580> knew<00:07:20.910> that<00:07:21.060> work

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.380 
yeah well they really knew that work

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.689 
yeah well they really knew that work
specifically<00:07:22.380> for<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.860> diesel<00:07:23.190> engine<00:07:23.490> right

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 
specifically for the diesel engine right

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.760 
specifically for the diesel engine right
here<00:07:23.910> let<00:07:24.210> me<00:07:24.240> turn<00:07:24.389> the<00:07:24.509> air<00:07:24.630> off<00:07:24.660> now<00:07:25.500> now

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770
