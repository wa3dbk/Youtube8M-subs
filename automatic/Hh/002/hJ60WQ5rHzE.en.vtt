just<00:02:13.879> like<00:02:14.060> batista<00:02:14.569> vs<00:02:14.840> jonh<00:02:15.050> cena<00:02:15.080> when<00:02:15.890> I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
just like batista vs jonh cena when I

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.699 
just like batista vs jonh cena when I

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
actually have the matchup I'm sure Randy

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.250 
actually have the matchup I'm sure Randy
can<00:03:31.579> figure<00:03:31.760> out<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.970> way<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.870> counter<00:03:33.139> the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
can figure out a way to counter the

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.339 
can figure out a way to counter the
shell<00:03:33.590> shock<00:03:33.620> into<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.760> RKO<00:03:35.120> maybe<00:03:35.420> as<00:03:35.690> Ryback

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
shell shock into the RKO maybe as Ryback

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.979 
shell shock into the RKO maybe as Ryback
has<00:03:36.829> him<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.130> his<00:03:37.280> shoulder<00:03:37.760> Randy<00:03:38.420> slips<00:03:38.690> off

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
has him on his shoulder Randy slips off

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.500 
has him on his shoulder Randy slips off
and<00:03:39.260> as<00:03:39.319> he<00:03:39.440> slips<00:03:39.739> off<00:03:39.980> yet<00:03:40.310> crk<00:03:40.819> oh<00:03:40.849> by<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
and as he slips off yet crk oh by the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.509 
and as he slips off yet crk oh by the
way<00:03:41.750> something<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:42.500> shouldn't<00:03:42.799> integrates

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
way something they shouldn't integrates

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.729 
way something they shouldn't integrates
into<00:03:43.910> making<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.750> next<00:03:44.930> year's<00:03:45.109> game<00:03:45.319> or<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
into making the next year's game or the

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.819 
into making the next year's game or the
one<00:03:45.889> afterwards<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.870> ability<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.440> counter

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
one afterwards is the ability to counter

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.930 
one afterwards is the ability to counter
finishers<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.849> two<00:03:50.630> finishers<00:03:51.169> so<00:03:52.099> you<00:03:52.790> know

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
finishers in two finishers so you know

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.620 
finishers in two finishers so you know
seamlessly<00:03:53.900> counter<00:03:54.349> an<00:03:54.530> AAA<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:55.160> turn<00:03:55.400> RKO<00:03:55.819> or

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
seamlessly counter an AAA in turn RKO or

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.059 
seamlessly counter an AAA in turn RKO or
how<00:03:57.049> about<00:03:57.079> ah<00:03:57.910> inay<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> into<00:03:59.810> a<00:04:00.169> codebreaker

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
how about ah inay a into a codebreaker

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.699 
how about ah inay a into a codebreaker
so<00:04:01.489> like<00:04:01.639> that<00:04:01.790> we've<00:04:01.940> seen<00:04:02.349> these<00:04:03.349> moves

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
so like that we've seen these moves

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.589 
so like that we've seen these moves
before<00:04:04.099> I'm<00:04:04.549> lash<00:04:04.910> I'm<00:04:05.090> not<00:04:05.239> too<00:04:05.389> sure<00:04:05.569> about

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
before I'm lash I'm not too sure about

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.420 
before I'm lash I'm not too sure about
the<00:04:05.870> codebreaker<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.799> think<00:04:07.010> we've<00:04:07.160> we

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
the codebreaker but I think we've we

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.129 
the codebreaker but I think we've we
have<00:04:07.579> seen<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.090> yeah<00:04:08.389> I'm<00:04:08.599> pretty<00:04:08.750> sure<00:04:08.959> we<00:04:09.109> did

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
have seen it yeah I'm pretty sure we did

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.990 
have seen it yeah I'm pretty sure we did
obviously<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.099> wouldn't<00:04:10.280> apply<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.669> every

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
obviously I wouldn't apply to every

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.240 
obviously I wouldn't apply to every
single<00:04:11.120> finisher<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.739> know<00:04:12.859> for<00:04:13.069> some
