 spotlight featuring them the queen 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.860
 spider they are a mage hybrid 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.910
 killer distance or fighter of 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.770
 proximity 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.960
 alternating between the human forms of 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.669
 spider tries to isolate its fangs and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.770
 defeat them with their abilities and 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.939
 children 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.919
 Let's start with their team that 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.110
 automatically learned level one and 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.180
 allows you to switch between the human 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.700
 of a spider when switching to a spider 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.320
 She releases babies causes bonus damage on 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.210
 basic attacks and earn bonus 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.399
 speed and armor movement in 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.070
 magic resistance to passive them in 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.809
 no spiders in human form ever 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 that enemies series as ability 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.909
 she prepares a baby to the limit 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.499
 when switching to spider form it releases 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.600
 these children to fight against their 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.059
 until they die or she goes back to the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.589
 human 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.960
 now we talk about your skills in 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.699
 human neurotoxin that causes damage 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.110
 to an enemy and giving bonuses based on 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.180
 your life at that moment 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.550
 the healthier something else in the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.470
 caused a volatile spider path to the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 location of the target exploding in the first 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.160
 enemy sitting 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 If you do not hit anything, it will 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.870
 enemy or simply explode 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.820
 after a few seconds when spider 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.850
 volatile explosion causes damage to all 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.650
 enemies close cocoon and the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.820
 made the first enemy successful by 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.430
 a short interval 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 now let's talk about your 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.390
 spider form poisonous bite cause 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.700
 damage and gives the enemy new mote causing 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.980
 bonus damage based on lost life 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.600
 the more injured target the greater damage 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.210
 cause I recommend putting a dot 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.460
 neutral toxin measure painful at level 2 and 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.430
 maximizes by level 13 for damage in 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.350
 individual targets frantic glide 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.180
 significantly increases the speed and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.550
 attack denise their offspring by some 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.830
 seconds while frantic gliding 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.050
 is active attacks and lisi your children 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.060
 they healed put a spider 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.400
 volatile frenetic sliding on the level 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.560
 1 and maximize the first large offers 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.010
 presence in the jamb as well as eliminating 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.710
 troops 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.450
 the route apel suspends lise their offspring in the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.820
 air from being admired if 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.040
 revealing nearby foes if abseiling 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.730
 cast on the enemy it will descend on him 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.920
 immediately rabel cast on a target 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.360
 it will stay on the air for a while and may 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.240
 be thrown back into an enemy 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.160
 near to weave in case the rappel 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.810
 may have a point placed early but by the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 utility offered can be maximized 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.140
 finally to the Canadian of commerce in 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.760
 human form and cast is volatile change 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.320
 immediately to form a spider and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360
 Throw frantic 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.560
 to eliminate camp did not work out which 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.270
 I traveled between fields 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.950
 remember to continue in the form of 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.870
 spider whose speed movement 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 increased help to move faster 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.160
 by john alcantar it is best to start at 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.680
 the human form beginning with the case and the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 other abilities after activating form 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.160
 to help bring down their prey 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.620
 with poison bite and slip 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.120
 frenetic storing rapel allows you to reach 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.860
 no enemies on the run 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.990
 if you can not reach it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.790
 feel free to start rappelling 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.040
 after realizing how poisonous maintained 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.870
 frantic gliding switch to shape 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.300
 make the case easier to 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 hit you later you can go back to 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.520
 spider form for the last time to 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.530
 poisonous bites and here the sometimes 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.900
 enemies know if a gang is coming 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.850
 if you play too aggressively with 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.910
 they do not need to do these 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.500
 types of maneuvers said to be Greek and 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.600
 after fellow tries to escape 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.070
 Elise follows in spider form. 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.840
 rappel and ends that the poisonous comfort 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.519
 since you will often earn you 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.600
 you will find yourself overtaking the tower 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.820
 black to learn 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.830
 after causing initial damage to them 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.350
 flee the tower and call to escape from his 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.480
 damage waiting for the refills it returns 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.459
 with java in the frog in the cocoon and spider 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.570
 volatile while out of range of the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.280
 tower to guarantee here or without 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.380
 role reveals enemies in battle 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.510
 making it great to initialize the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.550
 will respond counter-attacks did not advance 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.320
 he is able to go down and steal his 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.280
 own perrone's blog and I worked 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.980
 five cases 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.540
 although initially escaping you can achieve 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.050
 hit the final blow thanks to 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.480
 their assistance 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.000
 we stay near the walls in the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 jango camps this can save the 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.820
 your life 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.980
 evelyn sets off on them knowing that 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.290
 she can not normally escape elisa 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.180
 rappel reveals specter camp 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.090
 and lands on the other side of the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.980
 wall avoiding a sad end in watts 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.440
 Their purpose is to cause large and 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.300
 fast damage and then play a little 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.460
 evasively until the other target is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.830
 found we will slow down the fight a 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.170
 little to see every action or notice 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.940
 lioness he gets loose with biting verminose 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.100
 and causes great harm to their young 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.440
 while your team gets river now 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.840
 with a short life he moves back to the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.030
 human form to shoot at a distance from 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.980
 security of the shrub it a certain case and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.870
 with neurotoxin to knock down 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.160
 leasing 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.620
 now he meets both ellen 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.810
 Portuguese with little life so she uses 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.650
 form of a spider and descends to 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.120
 overturn poisonous bite laws 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.770
 while she flees a quick case while 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.790
 North guarantees claws on spiders not 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.790
 get chases 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.870
 other emphasis on proof the same concept in 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.640
 human form cocoon spider bolatti 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.710
 neurotoxin that causes initial damage 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.360
 nor does it create a space between 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.550
 your opponents before it enters 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.620
 state and focus on your attention and 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.660
 to hit cocoon it changes to form of 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.180
 spider and gives the boat as poisonous orders 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.840
 guaranteed the same here after being isolated 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.940
 for leasing 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.820
 they still band blood looking for more 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.070
 fangs running up to the wall she uses 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.280
 rafael finds leasing and descends to another 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.280
 that 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.330
 I recommend building elise with a mixed 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.080
 of durability and reduction of 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.790
 recharge 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.190
 here is an example that can work 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.560
 well even if it's your first time with 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.750
 champion of magical penetration marks 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.050
 cielo de armadura residence books 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.600
 magic essence of skill power 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.760
 in 1912 new magical penetration talents 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.440

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.250
 neutral and useful 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.040

 some dora rings or ring of the

 prospector agilize a century of crystal 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.120
 from there and then include 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.340
 wizard except bissau to increase 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.900
 its supply of damage ahead tends to 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.030
 increase the durability and 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.740
 refill with items like frozen heart 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.780
 zone hourglass and guardian angel 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.510
