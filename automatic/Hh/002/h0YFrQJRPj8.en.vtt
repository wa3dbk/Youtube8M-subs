00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.560
 for miguel ports to bet on his goal 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.590
 the way will tell some 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.729
 then they from lucas chapter 24 25 13 to 35 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.579
 is reported the episode that followed after the uprising of the Lord Jesus 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.610
 says the Bible that same day 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.630
 two disciples walked to the emperor's robot while they talked to 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 respect of what had happened in the last days lucas 24 15 16 happened 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 that while talking and discussing 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.270
 Jesus himself approached and viacom inc. 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.180
 his eyes were as if they could not recognize 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 similarly this text of the Bible those two men who existed 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.530
 so there are people inside the church 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.860
 despite knowing that Jesus died and rose on the third day 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.889
 that when supernatural happened 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.120
 those of vines did not believe 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.270
 this can be proven because the sadness and the feeling of 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.709
 had dominated the heart of the designs 

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:03.030
 because of the death of the Lord Jesus 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 and how often does this same feeling doubt the hearts of people 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.270
 how many times doubt has afflicted the people who are in the church 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.170
 it is necessary that the person knows 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
 that through which his spiritual condition is revealed 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 although it may be in some time in some church 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.409
 if you think or act in this way 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.260
 it's because the person does not know God 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.590
 Who knows God does not doubt 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.690
 know that Jesus has risen from the dead 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.219
 spiritually speaking 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.310
 they know they have the virus 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.200
 the text later in verse 24 25 and 26 says 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.940
 so they said jesus 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.950
 with the maersk and the deputies decoration to believe that all that the prophets 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.900
 they said 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.270
 was it not fitting that the Christ should enter into his glory 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.340
 so these men knew that Lord Jesus Christ would manifest himself 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.290
 that their hope was for the bce to establish a reign of command 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.729
 This is what has happened these days. 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.790
 in many people's lives many people want a change in life 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.050
 in life 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.439
 family in sentimental life 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.540
 but this change will not happen 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.189
 until there is a change in its interior 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.209
 the truth is that what the person is experiencing is due to the crisis is 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.179
 that she has 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.669
 human being is in the way she wanted it from the moment she 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.379
 you pass your faith in the right way 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.559
 then your situation changes 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:34.299
 Suddenly you even say but I've done so much I pray I read the bible 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.979
 it was fasting 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.269
 I go to church 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.389
 I give my says changed my offer but still my life does not change 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.910
 so he admitted that his life does not change 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.829
 Why do not you still know God? 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.159
 when the person knows participated in his interior of the resurrection of Jesus 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:57.770
 when she raises me spiritually for no longer as allies 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.540
 with the eyes of the flesh with the human eyes but she begins to see 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.959
 spiritual eyes the problems 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.309
 we can not reach your life anymore 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.230
 the person who knows God 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.399
 to see from human eyes 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.719
 beyond which the carnal eyes we are seeing to see the invisible that is why 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.660
 she becomes a victorious person 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.850
 a person who passes the tired of her life come to conquer 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.829
 she sees with the eyes of God 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:22.780
 thus 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.240
 just as Jesus appeared on the road to emus 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.159
 it appears now in the person's life today 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.790
 and just as he spoke to the disciples he now speaks to the person 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.199
 Maybe you're with your heart sad your heart now do 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.139
 desperate, full of doubt 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.680
 filled with uncertainty of uncertainty because of the things that are happening 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.639
 suddenly looks at you singing worried and wearing head down bass 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.499
 depressed with no perspective of life 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.499
 then know that God opened your eyes 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.269
 so you can come and meet real 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.510
 to know God 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.400
 It is the greatest wealth that human beings can have is the main treasure that Earth 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.770
 is the most sublime loria that any human being can have
