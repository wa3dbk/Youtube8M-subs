00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
chemicals at all i'm pretty sure what

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.760 
chemicals at all i'm pretty sure what
their<00:04:34.880> perhaps<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.540> handmade<00:04:35.930> as<00:04:36.110> well<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:36.620> it's

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
their perhaps a handmade as well so it's

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.100 
their perhaps a handmade as well so it's
just<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.250> really<00:04:37.340> amazing<00:04:37.730> brand<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:38.870> what

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
just a really amazing brand this is what

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.110 
just a really amazing brand this is what
it<00:04:39.200> looks<00:04:39.350> like<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:40.340> think<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.700> packaging

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
it looks like and I think the packaging

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.180 
it looks like and I think the packaging
is<00:04:41.210> also<00:04:41.480> all<00:04:41.600> natural<00:04:41.930> as<00:04:42.020> well<00:04:42.230> because<00:04:42.680> it's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
is also all natural as well because it's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.550 
is also all natural as well because it's
not<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.640> appealing<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.390> it's<00:04:45.020> good<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.500> the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
not that appealing but it's good for the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.100 
not that appealing but it's good for the
environment<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:47.060> one<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.510> with<00:04:47.720> permits

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
environment and this one is with permits

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.930 
environment and this one is with permits
so<00:04:48.470> it's<00:04:48.740> really<00:04:48.980> tinky<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> lips<00:04:49.760> but

and but this I haven't tried this I'll

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.800 
and but this I haven't tried this I'll
be<00:05:36.320> honest<00:05:36.560> so<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:37.280> can't<00:05:37.790> say<00:05:38.030> if<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.419> like<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.720> or

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
be honest so I can't say if I like it or

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.200 
be honest so I can't say if I like it or
not<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.040> don't<00:05:40.250> if<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:40.460> can<00:05:40.610> see<00:05:40.820> but<00:05:41.060> it's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
not but I don't if you can see but it's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.320 
not but I don't if you can see but it's
made<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.840> two<00:05:42.260> different<00:05:42.470> parts<00:05:43.040> so<00:05:43.310> like<00:05:44.120> an

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
made of two different parts so like an

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.390 
made of two different parts so like an
oil<00:05:44.600> based<00:05:44.900> in<00:05:45.140> a<00:05:45.200> water<00:05:45.380> base<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:45.979> mix<00:05:46.220> it

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
oil based in a water base so you mix it

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.490 
oil based in a water base so you mix it
up<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.850> then<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.300> use<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:48.020> so<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.380> is

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
up and then you use it so that is

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.950 
up and then you use it so that is
probably<00:05:48.890> why<00:05:49.190> it's<00:05:49.640> really<00:05:50.210> moisturizing

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
probably why it's really moisturizing

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.659 
probably why it's really moisturizing
butter<00:05:51.290> mousse<00:05:51.560> or<00:05:51.590> makeup<00:05:51.950> as<00:05:52.190> well<00:05:52.220> because

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
butter mousse or makeup as well because

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.210 
butter mousse or makeup as well because
it<00:05:52.790> has<00:05:52.940> oils<00:05:53.330> in<00:05:53.450> it<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.840> fire<00:05:54.740> Pam<00:05:55.010> is<00:05:55.190> a
