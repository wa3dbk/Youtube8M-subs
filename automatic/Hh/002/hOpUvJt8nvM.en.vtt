a great 48-hour adventure and for me you

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.410 
a great 48-hour adventure and for me you
know<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.100> huge<00:00:11.309> privilege<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
know it's a huge privilege to do it's a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.349 
know it's a huge privilege to do it's a
format<00:00:12.809> I've<00:00:12.990> done<00:00:13.170> before<00:00:13.379> with<00:00:13.969> some<00:00:14.969> great

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:15.359 
format I've done before with some great

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.640 
format I've done before with some great
personalities<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.939> what<00:00:18.410> has<00:00:19.410> been

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
personalities and I think what has been

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.070 
personalities and I think what has been
powerful<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.939> seeing<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> wire

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
powerful for me is seeing how the wire

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
powerful for me is seeing how the wire
can<00:00:22.429> transform<00:00:23.429> people<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.419> can<00:00:24.449> empower

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
can transform people and it can empower

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.870 
can transform people and it can empower
people<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.829> reconnect<00:00:26.640> them<00:00:26.820> with

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
people and it can reconnect them with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.659 
people and it can reconnect them with
actually<00:00:27.470> who<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:28.679> and<00:00:29.159> I<00:00:29.279> think<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
actually who they are and I think the

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.659 
actually who they are and I think the
danger<00:00:29.909> of<00:00:30.300> Fame<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.259> it's<00:00:32.160> easy<00:00:32.460> for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
danger of Fame is that it it's easy for

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.920 
danger of Fame is that it it's easy for
people<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> go<00:00:33.060> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.480> mad

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
people to go a little bit mad

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.330 
people to go a little bit mad
you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.470> because<00:00:34.800> everyone's<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you know because everyone's kind of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.070 
you know because everyone's kind of
pampering<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.930> whatever

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
pampering to them and you get whatever

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.930 
pampering to them and you get whatever
you<00:00:37.290> want<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> makes<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.580> bit<00:00:38.760> crazy

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you want and it makes you go a bit crazy

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.630 
you want and it makes you go a bit crazy
and<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.560> great<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.280> wild

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
and I think what is great about the wild
is<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> ultimate<00:00:42.330> leveler<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.770> know

determine their family people and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.900 
determine their family people and
sometimes<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:16.920> don't<00:02:17.099> always<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> see

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
sometimes we don't always get to see

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
sometimes we don't always get to see
that<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.300> that's<00:02:18.629> what<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> love<00:02:19.080> about

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that and that's what I love about

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.690 
that and that's what I love about
running<00:02:19.620> wild<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.519> real

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
running wild we get to see the real

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.300 
running wild we get to see the real
people<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.660> surprising<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.860> almost

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
people it's surprising but almost

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.100 
people it's surprising but almost
invariably<00:02:24.440> encouraging

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
invariably encouraging

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.800 
invariably encouraging
I<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> motivation<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.910> do<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.180> varies

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
I think the motivation to do this varies

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420 
I think the motivation to do this varies
obviously<00:02:30.020> between<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.860> know<00:02:30.980> different

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
obviously between you know different

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.490 
obviously between you know different
guess<00:02:31.610> sometimes<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.870> they<00:02:33.020> they<00:02:33.260> grew

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
guess sometimes is that they they grew

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.470 
guess sometimes is that they they grew
up<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:33.830> country<00:02:34.160> people<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.120> although

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
up as country people but then although

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.610 
up as country people but then although
they're<00:02:35.600> out<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.900> life<00:02:36.050> they've<00:02:36.260> been<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
they're out at life they've been in the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.740 
they're out at life they've been in the
city<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.100> kind<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.240> reconnect

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
city and they kind of want to reconnect

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.520 
city and they kind of want to reconnect
with<00:02:38.870> actually<00:02:39.320> who<00:02:39.500> they<00:02:39.650> were

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
with actually who they were

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.070 
with actually who they were
sometimes<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.270> they've<00:02:43.690> done<00:02:43.840> all<00:02:44.050> of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
sometimes it is that they've done all of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.710 
sometimes it is that they've done all of
these<00:02:44.290> action<00:02:44.680> movies<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.730> they<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.480> it's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
these action movies but they know it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.360 
these action movies but they know it's
all<00:02:46.810> kind<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.170> make-believe<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:48.070> know<00:02:48.190> you've

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to do something for them that proves

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.080 
to do something for them that proves
actually<00:02:56.230> underneath<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.940> it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
actually underneath it they can do it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.490 
actually underneath it they can do it
and<00:02:58.240> they<00:02:58.390> are<00:02:58.420> tough<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.990> they<00:02:59.080> do<00:02:59.170> have<00:02:59.440> that

and I think what you remember is that
sense<00:04:38.290> of<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.830> pride<00:04:39.520> that<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:40.030> wild<00:04:40.360> gives

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
well I think we all have preconceived

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.659 
well I think we all have preconceived
ideas<00:05:39.690> about<00:05:39.720> what<00:05:40.289> movie<00:05:41.070> stars<00:05:41.340> are<00:05:41.520> like

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
ideas about what movie stars are like

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.909 
ideas about what movie stars are like
especially<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.479> people<00:05:42.840> we<00:05:42.990> kind<00:05:43.199> of<00:05:43.320> you

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
especially the people we kind of you

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.830 
especially the people we kind of you
know<00:05:43.949> really<00:05:44.610> see<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.850> lot<00:05:44.910> of<00:05:45.210> on<00:05:45.330> our<00:05:45.360> screens

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
know really see a lot of on our screens

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.969 
know really see a lot of on our screens
and<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.139> kind<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.350> think<00:05:46.500> I'll<00:05:46.620> maybe<00:05:46.830> they

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
and we kind of think I'll maybe they

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.260 
and we kind of think I'll maybe they
writ<00:05:47.160> like<00:05:47.280> this<00:05:47.460> all<00:05:47.699> they're<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.030> bit<00:05:48.240> like

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
writ like this all they're a bit like

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.510 
writ like this all they're a bit like
that<00:05:48.600> or<00:05:48.840> new<00:05:48.990> read<00:05:49.259> stuff<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.770> tabloids<00:05:50.250> and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
that or new read stuff and tabloids and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.460 
that or new read stuff and tabloids and
the<00:05:51.030> truth<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.479> most<00:05:51.780> of<00:05:51.960> time<00:05:52.139> it's<00:05:52.320> just<00:05:52.350> not

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
the truth is most of time it's just not

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.189 
the truth is most of time it's just not
true<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.490> think<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.910> genius<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:54.780> this<00:05:54.930> show

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
true and I think the genius of this show

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.689 
true and I think the genius of this show
is<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.620> get<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:55.919> see<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.160> real<00:05:56.430> person

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
is that you get to see the real person

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.540 
is that you get to see the real person
and<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.750> get<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.110> see<00:05:58.289> them<00:05:58.560> for<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.160> proper

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
and you get to see them for a proper

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.010 
and you get to see them for a proper
length<00:05:59.729> of<00:05:59.910> time<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.389> going<00:06:00.570> through<00:06:00.840> some

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
length of time and going through some

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.840 
length of time and going through some
hardships<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:01.919> they're<00:06:02.430> not<00:06:02.580> being

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
hardships and and they're not being

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.520

there's no one feeding them kind of

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.830
