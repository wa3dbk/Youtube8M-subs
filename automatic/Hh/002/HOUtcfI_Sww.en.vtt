00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.060
 hello youtube friends in this tutorial 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.259
 What I bring to you is how to download the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.169
 mod x raid for version 1.6 point 1 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.810
 from minecraft the link is in the 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.949
 description of the video on two servers 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.990
 of download in mega and half or square one 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.690
 Once you have already loaded the file 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.900
 they give him to extract here he will ask them for a 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 password and I'll leave them in the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.860
 video description 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.880
 I downloaded 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.820
 we go to the launcher folder 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.800
 where they unpacked it in my case is 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.200
 here then later 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.970
 already being there in the folder where 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.830
 they installed the new launcher of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 minecraft pirate or premium not care 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 serves for both of us we go to versions 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.300
 and we copy the folder that says 1.6 point 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.300
 1 x raid we copy and paste it 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.870
 that's it now we're going to minecraft 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.870
 we open the new launcher 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.140
 once it has opened we look for 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.540
 the version that says reveal 1.6 point 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.900
 one 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.130
 or if they are premium they give in creating a 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 new profile and select the 1.6 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.590

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.590
