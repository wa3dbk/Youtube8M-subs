00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.210
 such an account that I also love the machine 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.890

 good because this doctor about change 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.730
 In the next chapter we will show 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.940
 how it is filled 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.400
 let's say done promoted in the leaves 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.030
 to sue the conquest until the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.250
 next chapter 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 we are currently watching the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.990
 preparation of the half being filled 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.119
 in the road we see shopping 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 Folds that Mrs. Carmen does and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.670
 and then take out of the can 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.520
 this is making me the little ball of color 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.520
 the sun color to the salamina mound 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.670
 and the process 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.190
 After the milled corn we are 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the first part 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.340
 Yes now 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.150
 forming arming the rise for 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.599
 subsequently be stretch water to be 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.599
 cooked 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.090
 you have to be patient if it seems like a 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.090
 home unless 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.290
 10/01/2010 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.400
 what is the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.940
 how can the leaf 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.690
 very good explanation 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.780
 although I starve 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.080
 to the making of it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.400
 and now let's proceed state is at 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.400
 side already on the outside 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.860
 the plant that is showing the humita 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.160
 you can record to the camera 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.390
 throwing the half here to the process of 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.819
 knowledge where half 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.799
 he started how rich all chile likes 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.150
 of this traditional field payroll 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:58.730
 Chilean and later when they are 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.549
 ready and we will do the fourth stage in the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.469
 what you expect as is the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.340
 process of April humita and commercial 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:11.019
 omit that the most important thing 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.019
 so you can see that it is not easy 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:22.919
 and thank you 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.700
 we are enjoying 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.530
 molina 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.800
 negatively 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.900
 chapter 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900
