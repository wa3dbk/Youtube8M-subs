aren't<00:00:45.050> completely<00:00:46.050> correct<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.950> there

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
aren't completely correct I think there

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.420 
aren't completely correct I think there
are<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.309> strange<00:00:47.670> supports<00:00:49.219> some<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> them

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
are some strange supports some of them

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.619 
are some strange supports some of them
are<00:00:50.550> fairly<00:00:50.730> strange<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.239> click

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
are fairly strange but you can click

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
are fairly strange but you can click
these<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> rough<00:00:56.100> idea<00:00:57.890> basically<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
these to get a rough idea basically in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.590 
these to get a rough idea basically in
League<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.640> Legends<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.329> five

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
different roles there's a top mid

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.859 
different roles there's a top mid
there's<00:01:04.350> ad<00:01:04.769> carry<00:01:05.159> support<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> jungle<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
there's ad carry support and jungle so

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.030 
there's ad carry support and jungle so
obviously<00:01:09.869> top<00:01:10.110> media<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.710> their<00:01:10.799> respective

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
obviously top media and their respective

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
obviously top media and their respective
lanes<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.930> bot

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
lanes they get top on it and then bot

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.550 
lanes they get top on it and then bot
Lane<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.710> AD<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> support<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.409> support

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
Lane is AD and the support the support

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
Lane is AD and the support the support
just<00:01:16.890> helps<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> ad<00:01:17.430> farm<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:19.070> I'm<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.580> let's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just helps the ad farm so I'm here let's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
just helps the ad farm so I'm here let's
see<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> look

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.660 

range<00:01:28.080> okay<00:01:29.080> you'll<00:01:29.290> see<00:01:29.470> these<00:01:29.650> ranged<00:01:30.160> these

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
range okay you'll see these ranged these

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.420 
range okay you'll see these ranged these
are<00:01:30.940> most<00:01:31.840> likely<00:01:32.260> just<00:01:32.290> all<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.220> range

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
are most likely just all the range

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.820 
are most likely just all the range
characters<00:01:33.820> in<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.000> game<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:35.080> there<00:01:35.650> are<00:01:35.770> a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
characters in the game but there are a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.190 
characters in the game but there are a
certain<00:01:36.040> amount<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.750> characters<00:01:37.750> which<00:01:37.960> are

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
certain amount of characters which are

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.930 
certain amount of characters which are
ad<00:01:38.650> which<00:01:39.400> under<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.030> ad<00:01:40.420> tag<00:01:41.230> ad<00:01:42.160> carry<00:01:42.490> which

ad which under the ad tag ad carry which

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.930 
ad which under the ad tag ad carry which
is<00:01:43.150> generally<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.840> strong<00:01:44.320> ranged<00:01:44.920> carry<00:01:45.670> which

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
is generally a strong ranged carry which

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.260 
is generally a strong ranged carry which
is<00:01:46.300> generally<00:01:47.140> best<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.770> kin<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.820> ash

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
is generally best really kin so ash

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.890 
is generally best really kin so ash
Kaitlyn<00:01:50.110> Corki<00:01:50.710> Draven<00:01:51.550> etc<00:01:52.330> they're<00:01:52.540> all<00:01:52.660> 80

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
Kaitlyn Corki Draven etc they're all 80

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.440 
Kaitlyn Corki Draven etc they're all 80
carriers<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:54.160> gonna<00:01:54.280> be<00:01:54.400> quite<00:01:54.610> hard<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.880> see

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
carriers it's gonna be quite hard to see

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.870 
carriers it's gonna be quite hard to see
it<00:01:55.570> now<00:01:55.750> but<00:01:56.440> once<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.010> start<00:01:57.220> playing<00:01:57.400> you

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
it now but once you start playing you

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.219 
it now but once you start playing you
learn<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.360> champions<00:01:58.810> then<00:01:59.050> you'll

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
learn all the champions then you'll

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.380 
learn all the champions then you'll
definitely<00:01:59.470> see<00:01:59.890> which<00:02:00.130> where<00:02:00.850> each<00:02:01.000> one<00:02:01.180> goes

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
definitely see which where each one goes

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.490 
definitely see which where each one goes
so<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.619> role<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.640> ad<00:02:03.790> carry<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.320> need

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
so the role of the ad carry is you need

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.950 
so the role of the ad carry is you need
to<00:02:05.619> build<00:02:05.860> ad<00:02:06.280> items<00:02:06.729> you're<00:02:07.509> not<00:02:07.630> going<00:02:07.840> to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
to build ad items you're not going to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.350 
to build ad items you're not going to
know<00:02:08.080> much<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.950> stats<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.399> items<00:02:09.729> but

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
know much about the stats on items but

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.030 
know much about the stats on items but
in<00:02:10.420> next<00:02:10.479> tutorial<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.290> be<00:02:11.560> looking<00:02:11.770> at

in next tutorial I will be looking at

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.640 
in next tutorial I will be looking at
teaching<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.900> need<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.530> build

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
teaching you that so you need to build

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
strong and then you're the main team

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.960 
strong and then you're the main team
fight<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.380> end<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.830> game<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.760> put

said before lady carriers bot Lane and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.440 
said before lady carriers bot Lane and
you've<00:02:24.459> got<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.880> as<00:02:24.940> much<00:02:25.060> fun<00:02:25.300> as

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.850 
most of these are correct but there are
a<00:02:33.850> couple<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.299> odd<00:02:34.510> ones<00:02:34.709> support<00:02:35.709> is

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
you won't see much of this until

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.180 
you won't see much of this until
probably<00:02:58.890> about<00:02:59.040> level<00:02:59.460> 20<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.740> good<00:03:02.160> to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
probably about level 20 but it's good to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.160 
probably about level 20 but it's good to
be<00:03:02.310> aware<00:03:02.460> of<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.860> just<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:06.330> basically<00:03:06.960> the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
be aware of it's just it's basically the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.370 
be aware of it's just it's basically the
matter<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:08.550> could<00:03:08.730> change<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.180> time<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.690> maybe

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
matter it could change in time so maybe

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.570 
matter it could change in time so maybe
in<00:03:10.770> some<00:03:11.010> time<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.870> way<00:03:13.380> things<00:03:14.040> happen

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
in some time the the way things happen

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.160 
in some time the the way things happen
will<00:03:14.790> be<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.910> bit<00:03:15.090> outdated<00:03:15.210> in<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.870> video

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
will be a bit outdated in this video

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.130 
will be a bit outdated in this video
will<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.860> outdated<00:03:17.270> but<00:03:18.270> for<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
will be outdated but for now and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.050 
will be outdated but for now and
probably<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.830> long<00:03:19.980> time<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.790> what

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
probably for a long time this is what

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.980 
probably for a long time this is what
its<00:03:21.180> gonna<00:03:21.300> be<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.920> then<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.270> mid

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
its gonna be like so then we get to mid

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.620 
its gonna be like so then we get to mid
lane<00:03:25.170> mid<00:03:25.560> lanes<00:03:25.770> usually<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.400> ap<00:03:26.730> carry<00:03:27.000> ATS

are starting to come into it but I'm
going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> talk<00:03:29.190> about<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.550> now<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.500> that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
strong ap type champions as I said I'll

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.380 
strong ap type champions as I said I'll
teach<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.530> about<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.770> stats<00:03:41.040> next<00:03:41.430> game<00:03:41.580> so

they<00:03:42.900> use<00:03:43.350> mostly<00:03:43.830> spells<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.460> do<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.670> damage

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
they use mostly spells to do the damage

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040 
they use mostly spells to do the damage
these<00:03:46.680> guys<00:03:46.920> go<00:03:47.190> mid<00:03:47.540> mainly<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.750> they<00:03:48.900> can

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
these guys go mid mainly so they can

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.330 
these guys go mid mainly so they can
gank<00:03:49.260> other<00:03:49.410> lanes<00:03:49.500> they've<00:03:49.950> got<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.130> very

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
gank other lanes they've got a very

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.070 
gank other lanes they've got a very
strong<00:03:50.640> mid<00:03:50.940> game<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:53.900> there's<00:03:54.900> another

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
strong mid game and there's another

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.520 
strong mid game and there's another
reason

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
reason

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.840 
reason
oh<00:03:55.560> yeah<00:03:55.860> they<00:03:55.980> need<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.250> be<00:03:56.340> close<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.670> blue

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
oh yeah they need to be close to blue

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.960 
oh yeah they need to be close to blue
there<00:03:57.630> are<00:03:57.780> other<00:03:58.200> reasons<00:03:58.470> further<00:03:59.460> on<00:03:59.700> but

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
there are other reasons further on but

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.840 
there are other reasons further on but
I'm<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:00.210> gonna<00:04:00.510> go<00:04:00.690> too<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:01.200> depth<00:04:01.850> but

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
I'm not gonna go too in depth but

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.460 
I'm not gonna go too in depth but
basically<00:04:03.210> there's<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:03.930> person<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.350> gives

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
basically there's one person that gives

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.150 
basically there's one person that gives
mid<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.010> that's<00:04:05.250> usually<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.590> AP<00:04:07.590> carry<00:04:07.830> as<00:04:08.010> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
mid and that's usually the AP carry as I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.640 
mid and that's usually the AP carry as I
said<00:04:08.310> before<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.020> have<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.350> top

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
said before then you have the top

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.740 
said before then you have the top
usually<00:04:11.100> these<00:04:11.460> are<00:04:11.700> something<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
usually these are something like the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.320 
usually these are something like the
fighter<00:04:13.020> champions<00:04:13.500> maybe<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:14.700> majority<00:04:15.030> of

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
fighter champions maybe the majority of

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.150 
fighter champions maybe the majority of
these<00:04:15.450> will<00:04:15.720> go<00:04:15.840> top<00:04:16.080> maybe<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.710> exception<00:04:16.980> of

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
these will go top maybe the exception of

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.210 
these will go top maybe the exception of
Blitzcrank<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.530> see<00:04:19.770> Blitzcrank

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
Blitzcrank you do see Blitzcrank

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.920 
Blitzcrank you do see Blitzcrank
occasionally<00:04:20.640> they<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.000> won't<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.510> wouldn't

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
occasionally they so I won't I wouldn't

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.190 
occasionally they so I won't I wouldn't
keep<00:04:22.140> too<00:04:22.680> close<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:24.200> usually

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
keep too close to that and usually

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.230 
keep too close to that and usually
they're<00:04:25.410> more<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.160> tanky<00:04:26.610> role<00:04:26.790> sometimes

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
they're more of a tanky role sometimes

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.920 
they're more of a tanky role sometimes
more<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.520> well<00:04:29.520> they're<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> bruiser

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
more of a well they're like a bruiser

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.170 
more of a well they're like a bruiser
that's<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.980> word<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.970> league<00:04:33.120> of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that's what the word is in league of

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.090 
that's what the word is in league of
legends<00:04:33.540> where<00:04:34.080> you're<00:04:34.290> tanky<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.920> do

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
legends where you're tanky but you do

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.010 
legends where you're tanky but you do
some<00:04:35.340> damage<00:04:35.760> as<00:04:35.910> well<00:04:36.060> so<00:04:36.630> there<00:04:36.930> are

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
some damage as well so there are

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.370 
some damage as well so there are
different<00:04:37.320> types<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.710> top<00:04:38.490> roles<00:04:38.790> but

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
different types of top roles but

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.690 
different types of top roles but
basically<00:04:40.380> that's<00:04:40.800> what<00:04:41.220> you<00:04:41.310> need<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.550> bring

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
basically that's what you need to bring

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.860 
basically that's what you need to bring
to<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.910> team

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
to the team

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.170 
to the team
while<00:04:44.470> you're<00:04:44.680> low<00:04:44.830> level<00:04:45.250> there<00:04:45.730> will<00:04:45.850> be<00:04:45.880> two

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
while you're low level there will be two

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.510 
while you're low level there will be two
people<00:04:46.360> top<00:04:46.660> because<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.410> jungle<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:47.950> more<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.460> a

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
people top because a jungle is more of a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.160 
people top because a jungle is more of a
role<00:04:48.730> that<00:04:48.760> happens<00:04:49.300> at<00:04:49.450> level<00:04:49.720> 20<00:04:50.020> once

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
role that happens at level 20 once

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.010 
role that happens at level 20 once
people<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.590> variants<00:04:50.980> but<00:04:51.760> you'll<00:04:52.540> start<00:04:52.780> to

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
people get variants but you'll start to

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.510 
people get variants but you'll start to
understand<00:04:53.470> jungle<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.860> might<00:04:54.010> see<00:04:54.220> one<00:04:54.340> or

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
understand jungle you might see one or

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.170 
understand jungle you might see one or
two<00:04:54.550> occasionally<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.710> if<00:04:57.310> we<00:04:57.640> have<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.850> look<00:04:58.030> at

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
two occasionally so if we have a look at

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.930 
two occasionally so if we have a look at
junglers<00:05:00.300> excuse<00:05:01.300> me<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.630> jungler<00:05:02.430> main<00:05:03.430> job<00:05:03.730> is

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
to do that they generally take smites

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.409 
to do that they generally take smites
which<00:05:18.460> is<00:05:18.610> one<00:05:18.730> of<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.910> summoner<00:05:19.210> spells

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
which is one of the summoner spells

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.990 
which is one of the summoner spells
which<00:05:19.780> will<00:05:19.990> also<00:05:20.200> be<00:05:20.380> in<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:21.010> tutorial<00:05:21.669> very

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
which will also be in a tutorial very

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.600 
which will also be in a tutorial very
soon<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.620> they<00:05:23.620> gank<00:05:23.950> of<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.160> lanes<00:05:24.340> they

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
soon and they gank of the lanes they

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.659 
soon and they gank of the lanes they
pretty<00:05:25.090> much<00:05:25.270> trying<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.720> help<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.050> lanes

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
pretty much trying to help the lanes

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.460 
pretty much trying to help the lanes
also<00:05:27.669> there<00:05:28.390> in<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.510> jungle<00:05:28.720> so<00:05:29.140> they<00:05:29.320> get

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
also there in the jungle so they get

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.880 
also there in the jungle so they get
more<00:05:29.620> XP<00:05:29.890> overall<00:05:30.400> for<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.669> team<00:05:30.880> and

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
more XP overall for the team and

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.940 
more XP overall for the team and
basically<00:05:32.890> it's<00:05:33.870> it's<00:05:34.870> just<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.830> don't

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
basically it's it's just a you don't

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.740 
basically it's it's just a you don't
have<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.280> lane<00:05:36.430> against<00:05:36.700> anyone<00:05:37.000> but<00:05:37.540> it's

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
have to lane against anyone but it's

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.930 
have to lane against anyone but it's
pretty<00:05:38.320> in-depth<00:05:38.890> I'm<00:05:39.100> not<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.400> greatest<00:05:39.850> to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
pretty in-depth I'm not the greatest to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.730 
pretty in-depth I'm not the greatest to
dreamers<00:05:40.240> myself<00:05:41.700> so<00:05:42.700> that's<00:05:43.320> basically<00:05:44.320> it

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
dreamers myself so that's basically it

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.360 
dreamers myself so that's basically it
in<00:05:45.010> terms<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:46.240> different<00:05:46.840> roles<00:05:47.160> as<00:05:48.160> she

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
in terms of the different roles as she

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.190 
in terms of the different roles as she
has<00:05:48.460> said<00:05:48.610> she<00:05:48.820> should<00:05:49.360> say<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:49.750> three<00:05:50.020> types

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
has said she should say the three types

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.780 
has said she should say the three types
of<00:05:50.350> junglers<00:05:50.740> is<00:05:51.190> utility<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:53.790> utility

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
of junglers is utility a utility

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.750 
of junglers is utility a utility
junglers<00:05:55.360> carry<00:05:55.840> junglers<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.760> support

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
junglers carry junglers and support

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.760 
junglers carry junglers and support
junglers<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.330> think<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.930> think<00:05:59.500> they're<00:05:59.650> the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
junglers I think I think they're the

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.760 
junglers I think I think they're the
three<00:06:00.360> but<00:06:01.360> once<00:06:01.540> again<00:06:01.810> once<00:06:02.110> you<00:06:02.320> learn<00:06:02.620> all

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
three but once again once you learn all

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.290 
three but once again once you learn all
the<00:06:02.860> champions<00:06:03.310> you'll<00:06:03.520> start<00:06:03.820> to<00:06:03.940> see<00:06:03.970> which

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
the champions you'll start to see which

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300 
the champions you'll start to see which
champion<00:06:04.750> does<00:06:04.930> what<00:06:05.140> and<00:06:05.380> what<00:06:06.100> to<00:06:06.220> expect

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
champion does what and what to expect

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.130 
champion does what and what to expect
from<00:06:06.610> your<00:06:06.760> jungler<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.540> I<00:06:07.570> wouldn't<00:06:07.990> worry

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
from your jungler so I wouldn't worry

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.180 
from your jungler so I wouldn't worry
too<00:06:08.260> much<00:06:08.380> about<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:08.740> either

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
too much about that either

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.210 
too much about that either
so<00:06:10.090> just<00:06:11.020> a<00:06:11.110> quick<00:06:11.290> recap<00:06:11.770> there<00:06:11.979> are<00:06:12.040> five

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
so just a quick recap there are five

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
so just a quick recap there are five
roles<00:06:12.460> mid<00:06:12.970> top<00:06:14.190> bot<00:06:15.190> which<00:06:15.640> is<00:06:15.790> ad<00:06:16.000> and

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
roles mid top bot which is ad and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.240 
roles mid top bot which is ad and
support<00:06:16.630> and<00:06:16.930> then<00:06:17.050> there's<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:17.350> jungler<00:06:17.680> but

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
support and then there's the jungler but

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.770 
support and then there's the jungler but
don't<00:06:18.550> expect<00:06:18.910> too<00:06:19.060> much<00:06:19.150> from<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.450> support

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
don't expect too much from the support

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.000 
don't expect too much from the support
