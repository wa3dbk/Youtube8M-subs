00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.030
 good morning the kitchen evolved today 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.030
 we represent the raw food dessert 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.310
 we have done this in the past 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.920
 but it was 90 percent Roma 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.250
 this time we will do it in full 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.170
 raw food then without using as 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.380
 we did it last time 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.190
 the rice sheets but I thought it was a pastry 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:51.190
 ad hoc based on apple for the pastry there 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:54.310
 it takes 5 apples tending to green and 2 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 tablespoons of syrup to gavi as 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.989
 concerns the ingredients of the filling 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 inside we need three apples 5 tablespoons 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:11.970
 of nuts 5 tablespoons of rehydrated raisins 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.150
 3 tablespoons gavi rom 30 g juice 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.570
 pine nuts a spoon of cinnamon in 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 powder a pinch of vanilla in 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.140
 powder 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.180
 the grated rind of a lemon e 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.770
 coconut flour 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.990
 let's start with preparing the pastry 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.440
 so let's try it with the help of 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.820
 peel lamela peel we cut 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.750
 at this point even slices 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.549
 coarse apples that we have private 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.720
 of the peel of the tour are we put it 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:53.380
 then in the container of the mix that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.259
 we whisk together with the two spoons of 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.259
 first spoon agave juice 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.269
 we spread the mixture we have 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:15.900
 obtained on the dryer tray 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.900
 covered with a sheet of baking paper 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.760
 we are almost finished defending the whole 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.459
 composed 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:35.799
 now we are ready to put it to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:38.799
 drying the pastry and ready was in 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.879
 drying about 9 hours however already 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.980
 the eighth hour and it was enough 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.650
 compacted consequently hardened 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.599
 should be sufficient from 8 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.660
 at 10 hours we remove the apple peel 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.609
 we want to give a visual impact of the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.000
 strudel we are preparing the most 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:04.329
 possible similar to the traditional one 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.720
 once the lamela peel is removed 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.630
 take a slice of lemon 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.150
 sprinkle on the surface to avoid 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.190
 that the apple adheres if recipe does not 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.060
 provides for use in the blender 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.510
 just not to make jam use 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.109
 the blame for the apple as you see the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.980
 we are chopping up with a 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.160
 knife 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.060
 in this way it will be restored 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.450
 the inner part of the strudel very much 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.550
 similar to the one made in the oven then 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.340
 with cooked apples maybe give one 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.720
 sprinkle with lemon if you see that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.380
 lamela is joining here is this 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.270
 point we have shredded enough 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.190
 lamela and therefore we can start a 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.190
 complete the filling like the rest 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:07.900
 We therefore incorporate ingredients 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:10.540
 raisins 5 tablespoons 5 tablespoons of walnuts 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:17.860
 esm let's start with these walnut also with 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:20.170
 hands the 30 g of pine nuts the spoon of 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:24.460
 cinnamon powder a pinch of 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:28.150
 vanilla the grated rind of 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.550
 lemon then here in the dough ne 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.550
 let's put 3 tbsp for the moment 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.930
 add another three tablespoons of 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.250
 competition syrup so in total six 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.250
 should be sufficient 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.500
 brush the pastry lying on a 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.469
 tray and presentation tray of 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.469
 brought with gaber syrup 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:11.600
 throughout the surface and especially to 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:22.270
 conjunction edges we pour the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:22.270
 content now we seal the strudel 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:38.050
 let's put syrup to the edge and 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.050
 close 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:48.890
 our pastry close the side a 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.660
 side we keep it open to show the 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.460
 internal content 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.230
 if you want to close them both 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.710
 obviously do the same operation 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:01.090
 also in the front side we brush 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.090
 with syrup by gale 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:13.880
 in this way the 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:16.730
 coconut flour well the strudel consists 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.370
 one hundred percent is ready we dedicate it 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.950
 everyone at his time when 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.120
 we proposed the strudel with the fouls of 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:29.980
 rice c screamed rightly and we did 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.720
 we already felt in duty of 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.790
 repeating it was a debt of honor well but 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.080
 now evolutionary organic cuisine to all and to 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.080
 next video recipe
