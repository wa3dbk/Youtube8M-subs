00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 good morning everyone today we talk about 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.640
 finals for fishing with the nymph when 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.620
 we use light nymphs we can 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.159
 safely use the dry finish 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.820
 having the foresight to shorten a little 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.219
 the team when we need it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.879
 to fish years ago in hunting or in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.500
 depth we will have to use a final 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.280
 more specific premise that I apply 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 this technique always with a cola with 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 a solina glued this for 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.289
 facilitate release operations 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 final that I recommend we always talk about 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:32.549
 of standard sizes is composed in this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.929
 mode is a beam composed of 40 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.970
 centimeters of 0 40 to which it was 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.580
 adding the saline to the head 40 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.349
 centimeters 0 40 of yellow thread 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:52.170
 new blood fluorescent 40 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:58.490
 centimeters of 0 30 fluorescent new 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:04.790
 blood 30 cm of common nylon 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:08.179
 of 0 20 at the bottom of which it will have been 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.399
 carried out the second azzolina where in 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.970
 fishing will be added depending on the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.319
 conditions a mm events a month 50 a 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 meter and sixty and so on 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.360
 this nylon is made of very thin nylon 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 thin will allow a fast a 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.700
 Foundation imitation fallen 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.100
 when using these endings with 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.530
 really heavy limitations is 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.350
 need to use a lot of attention 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.890
 because until they are released 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.140
 first a few meters of rat's tail does not 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.860
 you will have you will not have the directionality 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.880
 limitation goes where he says she should 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.459
 so we always use the maximum 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.890
 be careful because you get it in your head either 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.530
 on one ear it really does really 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.260
 badly, some went to the emergency room 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.940
 so always use glasses when 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.830
 we always practice this technique 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.090
 glasses and hat 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 I recommend not derogated I hope to 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.519
 to have been sufficiently clear 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.320
 I remain at your disposal for 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.500
 any further clarification 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.400
 thank you for your attention to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 next opportunity
