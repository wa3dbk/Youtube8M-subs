hi I'm going to be demonstrating some

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.360 
hi I'm going to be demonstrating some
new<00:00:06.450> functionality<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.500> put<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:07.890> my

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
new functionality that I put into my

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.959 
new functionality that I put into my
Sega<00:00:08.970> Genesis<00:00:09.500> synthesizer<00:00:10.500> project<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.849> new

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
Sega Genesis synthesizer project the new

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.740 
Sega Genesis synthesizer project the new
functionality<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> patch<00:00:13.530> change<00:00:13.980> support<00:00:14.519> a

patch change is a MIDI signal that

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390 
patch change is a MIDI signal that
requests<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.109> synthesizer<00:00:19.830> changed

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
requests that the synthesizer changed

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.769 
requests that the synthesizer changed
the<00:00:20.520> instrument<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.539> using

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the instrument it's going to be using

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.560 
the instrument it's going to be using
for<00:00:22.140> example<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:23.820> computer<00:00:24.210> might<00:00:24.359> tell<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
for example the computer might tell the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
for example the computer might tell the
synthesizer<00:00:25.170> DS<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> saxophone<00:00:26.189> or<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.519> violin

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
synthesizer DS a saxophone or a violin

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.700 
synthesizer DS a saxophone or a violin
or<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> slap<00:00:28.109> bass<00:00:28.349> or<00:00:28.619> something<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
or a slap bass or something like that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.990 
or a slap bass or something like that
the<00:00:31.710> way<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> demonstrate<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the way I'm going to demonstrate this is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.100 
the way I'm going to demonstrate this is
using<00:00:33.809> Ableton<00:00:34.469> Live<00:00:34.940> MIDI<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.149> awesome

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
using Ableton Live MIDI is awesome

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
using Ableton Live MIDI is awesome
because<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.370> Ableton<00:00:39.000> or

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
because you can use you know Ableton or

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.119 
because you can use you know Ableton or
reason<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> keyboard<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:42.030> control

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
reason or just a keyboard to control

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.410 
reason or just a keyboard to control
things<00:00:44.129> such<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
things such as this so what I have is I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
things such as this so what I have is I
have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> keyboard<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.739> where'd<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
have a keyboard over here where'd you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.360 
have a keyboard over here where'd you
can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.680 

alright<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.610> so<00:00:59.640> when<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.060> push<00:01:00.210> cheese<00:01:00.480> on

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
alright and so when I push cheese on

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.939 
alright and so when I push cheese on
here<00:01:02.300> obviously<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> plays<00:01:03.600> no<00:01:03.960> big<00:01:04.140> deal<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
here obviously it plays no big deal a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.090 
here obviously it plays no big deal a
cool<00:01:05.550> thing<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> added<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:07.680> Ableton

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
cool thing that I added was in Ableton

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
cool thing that I added was in Ableton
Live<00:01:08.420> when<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.960> channel<00:01:10.320> set<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.570> in

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Live when you have a channel set up in

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.170 
Live when you have a channel set up in
your<00:01:12.630> notes<00:01:13.500> panel<00:01:14.190> there's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> program<00:01:15.620> like

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
your notes panel there's a program like

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.750 
your notes panel there's a program like
combo<00:01:18.180> box<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.250> that's<00:01:20.250> where<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> select

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
combo box and that's where you select

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
combo box and that's where you select
your<00:01:22.760> like<00:01:23.760> program<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.510> want<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.720> use

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
your like program that you want to use

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.920 
your like program that you want to use
it's<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.200> called<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.440> program<00:01:25.770> box<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's just called a program box so when I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
it's just called a program box so when I
change<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.800> while<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.250> play<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.910> hear

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
change that while in play you can hear

00:01:30.119 --> 00:02:02.370 
change that while in play you can hear
its<00:01:30.330> loading<00:01:30.720> different<00:01:31.170> instruments

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.410 

so<00:02:03.380> um<00:02:04.210> vision<00:02:05.210> that's<00:02:05.570> useful<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
so um vision that's useful is that the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.740 
so um vision that's useful is that the
Sega<00:02:08.630> Genesis<00:02:09.259> ship<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.310> ym<00:02:10.610> t61<00:02:11.210> team<00:02:11.420> has

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
Sega Genesis ship the ym t61 team has

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.280 
Sega Genesis ship the ym t61 team has
like<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.470> huge<00:02:13.370> table<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.060> registers<00:02:14.600> inside<00:02:15.110> of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
like a huge table of registers inside of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.600 
like a huge table of registers inside of
it<00:02:15.380> it's<00:02:15.590> got<00:02:15.770> about<00:02:15.980> 50<00:02:16.459> different

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
it it's got about 50 different

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.550 
it it's got about 50 different
attributes<00:02:17.620> whose<00:02:18.620> values<00:02:20.020> determine<00:02:21.020> you

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
attributes whose values determine you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.550 
attributes whose values determine you
know<00:02:21.590> what<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> instrument<00:02:22.400> sounds<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:22.940> so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
know what the instrument sounds like so

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.140 
know what the instrument sounds like so
the<00:02:24.560> alternative<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:25.220> supporting<00:02:25.910> patch

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the alternative to supporting patch

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.320 
the alternative to supporting patch
change<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.040> 50<00:02:28.610> knobs<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.270> a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
change is to have 50 knobs on a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.440 
change is to have 50 knobs on a
synthesizer<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.680> whenever<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.550> user<00:02:31.670> wants<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
synthesizer and whenever a user wants to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.970 
synthesizer and whenever a user wants to
change<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.900> instrument<00:02:33.470> you'd<00:02:33.770> have<00:02:33.920> to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
change the instrument you'd have to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.890 
change the instrument you'd have to
tweak<00:02:34.310> all<00:02:34.459> those<00:02:34.610> knobs<00:02:34.880> until<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.570> sounded

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
tweak all those knobs until it sounded

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.350 
tweak all those knobs until it sounded
right<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.260> instrument<00:02:36.620> Saudi<00:02:36.800> right<00:02:37.330> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.060 

that's<00:02:41.360> about<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.630> um<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.290> guess<00:02:42.590> I'll<00:02:42.800> go<00:02:42.920> into

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
that's about it um I guess I'll go into

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.710 
that's about it um I guess I'll go into
a<00:02:43.190> little<00:02:43.250> bit<00:02:43.580> about<00:02:43.970> how<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.390> actually<00:02:44.540> works

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
a little bit about how it actually works

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.570 
a little bit about how it actually works
um<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.780> circuits<00:02:48.170> pretty<00:02:48.380> much<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.800> same

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
um the circuits pretty much the same

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.000 
um the circuits pretty much the same
except<00:02:50.239> for<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.780> new<00:02:51.080> edition<00:02:51.590> right<00:02:51.769> here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
except for this new edition right here

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.300

this is a ee prom which is basically

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.460 
this is a ee prom which is basically
just<00:02:55.510> memory<00:02:57.700> when<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:59.300> patch<00:02:59.600> change<00:02:59.989> signal

just memory when a patch change signal

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.400 
just memory when a patch change signal
comes<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.970> microcontroller<00:03:02.750> here<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.260> a

instrument<00:03:09.640> configuration<00:03:10.640> file<00:03:10.970> from<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
instrument configuration file from the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.350 
instrument configuration file from the
EEPROM<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.610> downloads<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.540> then<00:03:15.070> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
EEPROM and it downloads that and then it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320 
EEPROM and it downloads that and then it
basically<00:03:17.360> without<00:03:18.670> touching<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.880> data<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
basically without touching that data it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.900 
basically without touching that data it
sends<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.810> over<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.350> sound<00:03:21.590> chip<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.130> it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
sends it over to the sound chip so it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.509 
sends it over to the sound chip so it
programs<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.110> sound<00:03:24.350> chip<00:03:24.620> using<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.340> data

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
programs the sound chip using the data

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.770 
programs the sound chip using the data
that's<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.060> EEPROM<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:27.519> that's<00:03:28.519> about<00:03:28.610> it

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
that's on the EEPROM and that's about it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.959 
that's on the EEPROM and that's about it
thanks<00:03:29.780> for<00:03:29.930> watching
