that section when you've you've lasted

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.980 
that section when you've you've lasted
over<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.509> felt<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.020> over<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
over it and felt it over it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.910 
over it and felt it over it
breathable<00:02:09.990> felt<00:02:10.520> which<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:11.790> restricts<00:02:12.600> any

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
breathable felt which then restricts any

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.700 
breathable felt which then restricts any
access<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.630> any<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.810> us<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.110> any<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
access of any of us so any of a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.070 
access of any of us so any of a
ventilation<00:02:17.190> placed<00:02:17.670> into<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> roof<00:02:18.360> with

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
ventilation placed into the roof with

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.490 
ventilation placed into the roof with
this<00:02:19.380> felt<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.610> breathes<00:02:20.970> through

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
this felt it actually breathes through

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
this felt it actually breathes through
the<00:02:22.500> slate<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.060> gives<00:02:24.270> ventilation

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the slate so then it gives ventilation

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.120 
the slate so then it gives ventilation
into<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> roof

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
into the roof

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.700 
into the roof
which<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.300> obviously<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.840> insulation<00:02:28.380> in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
which then obviously as insulation in

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.910 
which then obviously as insulation in
between<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.280> joists<00:02:30.470> next<00:02:31.470> stage<00:02:31.910> ding-dong
