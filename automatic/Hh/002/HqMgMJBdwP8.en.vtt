00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.930
 court salt and seasoning but also let's 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.650
 Now I will tell you first read 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.580
 Generally what is the composition of the 95 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.920

 iodized salt vibration pepper and onion and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.040

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.240
 dextrose lauren knit 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.689
 major verdict in smith and santan 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 anti oxidant sound me the oscar benton 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.909
 preserve that x 3 mp mind nitrite 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 shorter here added only 5 percent 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 7 added here all kinds of acid 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 all sorts of supplements so energy 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.590
 value per 100 grams of product is what 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.439
 two kilocalories a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 proteins 17 grams carbohydrates 1 gram per 100 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.330
 gram and fat here 10 gram is lightly 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.120
 low fat 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.360
 30 gram fat tricks percent here 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.380
 only 10 percent weight of this product 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.899
 200 grams here are two sausages by one hundred grams 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.899
 2 sausages here is such a sausage 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.450
 but what kind of sausage is here at all is 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.560
 raw mince raw minced pork with 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.520
 adding as I have already read 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 salt and seasoning well because it 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.350
 packed and stored for a long time here 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.400
 accordingly some canned 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.990
 preserve damask on preservative is so 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.630
 well and how is the plaintiff but mostly usually 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:48.510
 This falls on a bun and raw 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 it's all eaten up so here I am now and 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:03.660
 I will make here on a consistence look that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.300
 it turns out raw stuffing is then not 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.600
 brewed not fried not smoked right 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.050
 same raw and plaintiff 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.519
 so i will do now called this yet 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:22.769

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:26.730

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.989
 during the day he sellers and eat something 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.970
 have it not stored for long on the same day 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:38.489
 hit it all eat eat this 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.620
 snack in Russian I would call it 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.330
 snack 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.690
 closer to evening that is evening 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.550
 time is still the Germans something called one 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:56.160
 brother that is for dinner they eat not something 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.410
 hot can calmly take the bread and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.180
 some sausages make sandwiches 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 pocus sandwiches 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.670
 this will need is called a ben ford 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:20.120
 I got such a sandwich with 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:23.220
 raw ground meat 95 percent pork 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.080
 10 percent fat here you can see that 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:32.000
 there is alive and meat so but still not all 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.000
 then all this can be peppered 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:42.449
 someone else likes then on top fresh onions 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.900
 but I do not particularly like onions yennu is not 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.220
 want 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.699
 and it turned out like this 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:57.889
 appetizer such a sandwich with raw minced meat 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.889
 again I will say, this is called my trust and 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.880
 enjoy your meal 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.630
 tastes like raw minced meat 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.780
 from salty confirmed 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:32.650
 it smells like pepper now because 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.650
 fresh peppers smell before seppo 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:44.390
 it doesn't smell like meat but it tastes pretty 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:50.540
 still pleasant with tea is pretty 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:52.640
 still tasty in Russia we Novosibirsk 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.220
 I have not seen such a product can be 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:01.130
 Of course it is somewhere else , somewhere else 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:03.110
 be making such a sausage or not if 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.570
 familiar to you if you have in the region 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.460
 write in the comments would be 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:13.550
 interesting cool such a snack first 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.920
 once saw Germany and for a long time not 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.790
 I did not dare to try it but 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.410
 it's really raw mince somehow I 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.630
 used to like meat should be 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.260
 cooked cooked heat us go for 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.600
 polina somehow but should be like 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.050
 said under subjected to hot 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.170
 handling the raw form I did not eat meat but 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.330
 tried it once I liked it 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.910
 The only thing that I buy is not very fat 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:45.470
 there is only 10 percent fat content 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:49.070
 30 percent fat that's a lot but so 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.890
 sometimes buy this one with preservatives 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.590
 because it is long kept here on 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.500
 packaging read it can be stored in 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.630
 Refrigerator 2 weeks 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.280
 if you buy a butcher shop, you need it 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.310
 same this 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.780
 On the same day, I have to write from there to 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.760
 comments can you have too 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.030
 region there is such a dish or something 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.100
 It will be very interesting if there were 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.100
 In Germany, tried this or go 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.700
 if you must try in Germany 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:21.070
 just ask no element of high school they 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.860
 there are not slightly smoked can and 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.960
 how to eat sausages but the meaning is the same there 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.960
 raw minced slightly slightly smoked 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.660
 also pretty tasty who tried 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.560
 such networth smoked once not even 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.730
 understand that this is just raw stuffing so 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.040
 delicious is a snack 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:46.030
 I advise you to try but everything is on it 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:49.540
 finish and a short video about German 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:53.220
