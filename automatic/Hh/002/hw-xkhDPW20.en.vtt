00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello as promised today comes the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hall and we'll catch you one right away 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 namely with the bi cream of p 2 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.349
 I have got myself in the color 0 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.450
 10 and from the first impression yes I think 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.710
 They have been very good ever since 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.989
 I wear them every day 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.119
 and today and I really want to 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:24.119
 to say much about it because I have a about 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.369
 video to rotate you can me 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 So, how are you supposed to say that? 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 I should still look for extra video 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.050
 Compare times with another 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.500
 foundation alone other baby cream 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.629
 or should i just about it an extra 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 video turn saying yes only the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.620
 Apply and then tell you like me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
 find him just write me yours 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.260
 Wish we wanted to have but wanted 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 In any case first impression is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 really very good then I have 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 also brought from manhattan this 21st 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 concealer with that pula in there and down 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 I have to say I found him now 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.809
 first order not so great but also 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 I will not say that any more than I do 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 I still have these fit never concealer 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.700
 bought from medellín and I found that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 Now surprisingly good and I think 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
 it will soon be a concealer video too 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.439
 Therefore , do not come to that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.299
 much more 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.570
 I also got myself from 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.259
 reval deluca the way highlighter in the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 color 0 1 now that and I have to admit 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.820
 usually you can not find me at 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.189
 display stands of rival Nokia but the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.200
 love with glitter mouse has this 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.170
 Highlighter shown in her job or 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.060
 favorite video and she has it like that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 raving and then I'm there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 went and rolled into the slide 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.039
 there was, of course, then no test but 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.210
 I then trusted your judgment 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.770
 and took this and I have to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.500
 say I'm very much in hindsight 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.719
 happy about 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.390
 it's a pink highlighter so 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.680
 it goes very well with rosé blush 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.679
 and he shimmers very vigorously so he 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.509
 but does not shimmer and blizzard 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.250
 he shimmers as I said very strong than 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.840
 You have to be a bit careful if you are 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.210
 with the brush comes in that you can not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.039
 a lot takes otherwise you can just too 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.560
 his face but I think he does yes 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.950
 I have it on it today and man 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.569
 definitely shines with it and 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.830
 it is really great 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.629
 Highlight actually not meant by 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.680
 rivaldo so look at him 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.269
 every case also once 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 Then I have three lipsticks 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.980
 brought namely from the astor heidi klum 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.160
 edition and that is the first color 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.680
 namely the 001 baby and when applying 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.730
 I have to say I found the lipstick 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.970
 a bit dry and yes he lets himself 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.019
 do not spread so easily 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 from the driver, I find him 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.010
 bit to help me so i'm wearing 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.480
 otherwise also like nude 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.760
 Lipstick then you have one 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.380
 a little bit more pink 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.560
 it's just too bright for me 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.599
 and yes , it's too easy 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.209
 after brother and yes I am now 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.670
 not so nice on the color but 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.260
 in any case he is wearing 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.579
 easy as good warps on everyone 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.130
 do not fall into the lips yet 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.390
 that's very good for a pen like that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.030
 Just have to see how he feels then 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 in the course of time if he does so himself 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.930
 good wear or longer on the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.840
 keeps lips or go off quickly 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.819
 the next color is the 002 sweetie 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 and I like the color in any case 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.730
 already much better and that's what I mean 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.639
 Also with this news driver 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.970
 lipsticks the more a bit 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.900
 are strong rosi colors and of 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.930
 wearing comfort 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.329
 not much different than the other 8 should 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 lipstick but the color is on everyone 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.519
 a lot better and that's it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.230
 last color that makes it the 007 bubbly and 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.569
 she's too strong for me i just have to 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.280
 let's say this is a very strong one 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.480
 Tonia almost island going down and yes 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.880
 so I probably would have him for me 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.350
 not bought now but I have it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.670
 I also not selected in my husband 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.109
 namely had the order me 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.950
 all these astro lipsticks 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.930
 bring 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.630
 because I had no possibility here 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.190
 to get the order and so the order 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.840
 he had had the last two of me 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.120
 So to get the two colors and then 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.069
 He was allowed to choose one more 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.569
 who says that she stands by me and then 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.120
 he has decided for that 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:21.250
 So what do you mean like me this 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 I would be interested in color 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.580
 then I have another lipstick 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.280
 brought by maybelline jade from the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.800
 palace 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.220
 a row namely the number 625 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.430
 Ice Channel and said I bought it 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.990
 i really wear it every day and 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.650
 Although it is because I am the color 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.110
 so beautiful think it is such a 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.370
 Rosewood does not sound like it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.530
 the name promises 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.990
 that surprised me first than me 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.480
 have told him and I think that's it 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.480
 actually just my lips color 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.700
 strengthened and therefore I think he stands 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.790
 me very well then me too 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.610
 ordered from the pharmacy the bio of 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.880
 sensitive h2o that the make up remover 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.310
 so to speak and as you can see I have 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.260
 already tested them a bit and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.960
 I think so too when I enter 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.100
 to turn extra video 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.970
 so I will not be too much 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.290
 betrayed about it 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.540
 then I was a little bit more 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.290
 douglas spending money and have me 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.940
 Chanel brought the soli chanel I was 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.740
 I think I'm a bit late with that 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.710
 The brother I believe two years ago 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.210
 but now I have him too 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.919
 finally brought and I think I will 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.960
 therefore an extra turn here still 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.490
 not so much to betray but I can 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.270
 So let me say that I think it's all right 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.450
 really great 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.590
 so I wear it today if you 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.810
 that somehow noticed that 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.960
 maintor is different and I am really 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.640
 very very nice at the brokser 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.590
 I am because you still have that 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:54.020
 terra ds should be called namely the number 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.240
 I do not know any number now 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.010
 fall is the brightest with am 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.600
 least worse because the others 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.220
 have extremely sparkles I have 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.440
 but not yet tried it out 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.460
 I do not say anything about it yet 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.430
 definitely wanted to go 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.300
 to have one from tera del sol and want that 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.500
 I will definitely be next 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.210
 Try and then of course 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.470
 also say so 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.770
 and last but not least I have something for me 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:20.270
 The clinic brought the resolution 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:23.900
 the yes with abo basis with 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.640
 SPF 15 and you know 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.610
 I think I want to talk about it every time 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.580
 that I 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.800
 red faces in the hair on banks 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.120
 in the cheek area in particular and 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.590
 That's why I just have a look 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.620
 chat out of the dear ones 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.949
 douglas saleswoman and since then I have 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.319
 she also tried and I am 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.610
 So I really love it 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.610
 Well, I think they really 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.719
 but I believe I am 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.870
 yes, once again an extra video 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:54.210
 turn fruits and that is that the greens 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.710
 colors and greens and wiso the red 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.120
 paint again but that's what I mean 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.330
 not that she will 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.819
 but that it is indeed in progress 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.560
 the time also brings something I know 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.729
 Not if I'm just imagining it 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.349
 it's also because of that, of course, that's me 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.090
 are now brought anything by 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:12.180
 the sun because then disappear the 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.469
 red spots on the face and so on 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.389
 I will definitely continue now 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:18.990
 use to the bitter end 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.180
 and then again something to you 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.860
 I hope, of course, that has 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.289
 I like the video and tell me again 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.259
 so far how to do this review 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:31.379
 like us from the p2 and me too 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.940
 this lipstick of billions so great 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.710
 so what do you think about it I am 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.930
 really very nice when he was 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.039
 In any case, I think that suits me 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.979
 very good 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:43.339
 and then we'll see each other in the next video 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:43.339
 again
