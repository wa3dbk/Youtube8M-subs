00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.279
 kingston is a company that you can 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.740
 know a different pc hardware 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 parts such as a ssd disks or a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 but they have memory benches recently 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 also released their own headset and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.380
 kingston hyperx cloud headset is there 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.239
 market where this company is now located 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 just don't worry about it anymore 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 or is this a shot in one go 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.790
 rose what I can say drop is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.010
 that you immediately notice that you are making 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 with a quality product and that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 you notice death 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 yes that sounds crazy this is the box me 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 I've already got the cover off 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.050
 and is immediately greeted by a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.180
 giant hyperx logo that nice site 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.270
 in the sunlight and so too if you have the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.609
 lid from you immediately get all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.530
 fabrics to protect it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.210
 here are all sorts of parts i me 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.009
 have already taken them out I leave you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.190
 see them all right away and then this too 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.649
 with once did a piece of text 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.110
 open you the things you sold 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.240
 now go the tryhou experience for true part 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 in the morning you will now experience it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.420
 yes that of course depends on the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.979
 quality of the headset 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 yes I mostly just think the quality 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670
 of the box 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
 yes really like being in 10 quality 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.970
 home picks up everything must be well protected 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.910
 normally a box really only becomes 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 used to doing things well and 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.759
 that's it actually 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.119
 so in that sense, I think it's fat 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.709
 You also have a bush underneath where 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 purchase the headset 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.539
 that too is just really very fat 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.520
 volatile so it protects the thing well 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.619
 this is him the kingston hyperx cloud 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 headset and i have to say i like it 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.489
 design immediately think it is very tight 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.770
 this black is not very special 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.959
 version but you notice it continuously 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 a harper x headset is because the brand is over 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.069
 everywhere and back at the top 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.709
 the brand on the side is the logo 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.360
 from kingston and also on different 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.009
 accessories such as the case that you 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.379
 provided when you sit on your head 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.020
 set you immediately notice a very comfortable 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.129
 feeling the thing is really very tasty 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.290
 just you can do it a bit too 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.480
 don't adjust the ears too much 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 can't say stretched too far 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.190
 but that is enough for me 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.570
 because 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.340
 I haven't hoped for a gigantic long 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.650
 and I often put it on the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.820
 smallest class what I edwin anyway 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.980
 This thing is that it's a closed one 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 Headphones are therefore the ear cups 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.370
 automatically to each other in their 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.080
 neutral position 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.610
 This means that your environment 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.830
 not get along at all if you do this 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.990
 thing on your head and you put your game on 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.600
 I like the sound very much because I like it 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.250
 is really in my game and because it 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 beach sand on this thing open as well 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.810
 so you can hear very well where 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.210
 your enemies are or where possible 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.770
 threats come from and disadvantage is 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.320
 of course that's really nothing anymore 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.190
 get out of the game and get what's on 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.990
 happens 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.170
 So if someone knocks on your door or 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.670
 you're watching porn then you have to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.290
 caught and how is the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.280
 sound quality of this thing you ask 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.520
 you might wonder 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.980
 very good I listen dearest music 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.020
 and preferably stuff and games with this thing 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 my head it is really delicious almost 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.100
 all types show that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.560
 there's enough pass in and you don't have it 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.480
 idea that you miss a certain tone like 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.950
 You're listening to plate 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.380
 is really wonderful to just be with this thing 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.540
 let yourself get lost in 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.900
 different gaming worlds or in you 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.730
 music 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.320
 You may have noticed that I 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.910
 two types of ear cups on my 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.190
 have headphones 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.050
 one is the standard headphone fabric 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.209
 that you do know which is also a bit slippery 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.420
 to the touch and it is more to the other 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.770
 nice back some more huggable fabric that 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.140
 you can also find different ones 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.300
 senheiser headphones and fat is 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.820
 of each of these types 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.540
 ear cups you get a set in the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.010
 box 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.470
 so you can choose which one you like 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.300
 I prefer to go for it myself 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.750
 condition to dust the headphones with 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.670
 the smooth black because there is less noise 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.350
 is blocked with the other one 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.260
 it all sounds a bit dusty 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.480
 look and I think it is just better 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.910
 it is more direct and nadu sometimes 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.010
 if you sweat and I know reasonable 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.620
 as sure as it is very hot then 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.150
 this also gets dirty faster and me 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.910
 must mention that it does 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.010
 it doesn't seem easy to switch easily 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.330
 first smartphone is part of it is like 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.130
 once you get it done 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.960
 his earcup is a good thing to do 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 then it is also sitting and no longer allowed 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.250
 disconnect the cable from the headset is not whole 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.169
 very long it will be about a meter 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.210
 and it ends with the standard jacks 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.699
 that you put on any headset headset 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.500
 find one for the sound of you 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.310
 headphones themselves and the other for the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.110
 microphone 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.910
 you can do this in any computer in the back 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.710
 stop and what I really love is that 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.970
 he a lot of extras with this headset 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.979
 ctr too 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.810
 and now red earcups because I can do it 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.550
 not see you have the cover that whole 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.690
 very good quality 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.210
 but you also have a few extra 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.340
 cables in you also get this handy 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.830
 device with on this device you can 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.419
 do the plugin of your headset and have 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.520
 here a volume willetje 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.289
 so that the volume can go under fly 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.599
 are going to adjust and you also have a button 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.960
 you may you can turn the microphone on and off 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.539
 put 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.460
 in addition, you also have a kind 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.199
 tours total button at the back 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.669
 which is also very handy and in addition 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.990
 forget it as a kind 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.000
 extension cord 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.070
 not a very long one but it is nevertheless 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.389
 something you also get this cable the tube 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.020
 that you like the headphones and the 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.090
 microphone 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.770
 a plug you can make that you can put back in 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.150
 Stop this tuft so that you put this in one 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.860
 behind the computer 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.650
 connect and last a sure not least 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.360
 we have this giant extension cable 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.889
 so if you want a while you or you want 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.690
 just have a long distance with you 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.289
 headset then this is the thing you need 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.090
 unpack 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.889
 as you can , they work fully 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.870
 package and you will get all kinds of type 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.729
 cable a little extra to you 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.070
 headset experience as fun as possible too 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.080
 and we dirk but you can 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.240
 perhaps wondering where well the microphone 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.759
 of this headset is for gaming 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.500
 headset is often a headset wherever you 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.990
 can also record things with the 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.880
 microphone where is the microphone than me 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.979
 do you see this i do not see him 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.380
 I have him here I think this is real 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.180
 very cool at the bottom of the left 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.340
 earcup is a flap that you can take off 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.590
 pick out hajus klein so hit him 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.180
 not lost and so you can 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.830
 plug in the microphone 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.870
 just very simple just take the ring 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490
 clicks and he does it 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.630
 I'm tired of you again 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.949
 pull out 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.659
 I think this is fantastic because of this 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.820
 likes to just do this thing 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.289
 use as headphones like me 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.270
 not zeros with other people 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.979
 so ideal that you can do it yourself 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.759
 choose when to put that thing in or not 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.320
 the way 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.330
 also great is the microphone 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.250
 again delicious mountain paths can itself 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.070
 determine the positioning of how 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.080
 is in front of your mouth 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.000
 and that is how the microphone sounds 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.030
 the headphone plug of the kingston 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.720
 cloud hyperx headset and if I whole 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.880
 be honest 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.470
 it actually sounds pretty damn good 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.750
 doesn't see much in the sound 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.980
 what and normal is because a lot of others 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.110
 they are crowns 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.090
 Also simply don't have that heavy duty 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.770
 sound but that is not a bad thing because 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.200
 what you should use this for is 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.550
 of course communicating in game and 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.560
 if communication is not successful 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.510
 between you and your team will certainly have had 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.860
 do not lie on the microphone because 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.550
 frankly for such a thing you 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.770
 must plug in 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.210
 I'm pretty impressed though 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.640
 though i can say that i am super satisfied 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.220
 am about the kingston cloud hair for x 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.500
 headset it's just a full 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.910
 package you have a great headset 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.040
 but very good sound comes out 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.630
 you have a pretty good headset 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.130
 microphone it does of course can 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.930
 of course not to match different 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.910
 studio microphones in japan must 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.200
 connect bla bla bla again if you 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.120
 thus to communicate with your team 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.380
 mates then that is possible and then it will succeed 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.540
 it feyenoord this 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.700
 to remove from the headphones is find 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.440
 I ideal if I just want to join this thing 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.520
 take on the road as if just to 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.840
 headphones 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.180
 in addition, all the extras that you add 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.070
 it gets it's fantastic it 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.560
 are all great extras that 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.100
 useful and how much does it all cost 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.830
 together 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.780
 90 euros even though it was only one 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.400
 I already recommended headphones 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.650
 but the fact that it is a gaming headset 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.840
 is with all that extra star to make this 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.360
 just a fantastic part the kingston 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.000
 hyperx cloud headset 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.570
 a big fat thumb up and so and 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.570
 recommended
