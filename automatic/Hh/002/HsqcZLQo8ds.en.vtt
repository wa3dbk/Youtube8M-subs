00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
adore these leggings and the only issue

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.590 
adore these leggings and the only issue
is<00:05:42.290> that<00:05:42.500> they<00:05:42.830> are<00:05:42.860> sheer<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:43.970> can't<00:05:44.360> wear

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
is that they are sheer so you can't wear

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.450 
is that they are sheer so you can't wear
them<00:05:44.780> with<00:05:44.930> like<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.080> short<00:05:45.350> top<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:46.070> that's<00:05:46.250> why

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
them with like a short top so that's why

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.920 
them with like a short top so that's why
I<00:05:46.490> paired<00:05:46.730> them<00:05:46.940> with<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.300> which<00:05:47.570> is<00:05:47.750> longer
