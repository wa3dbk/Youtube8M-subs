 to make it difficult for teachers to flush out 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.230
 but you also have to use these methods in 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.570

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 he is interested in the exam 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.100
 not for the students, this only feels 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 as a second big break and left dear 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.500
 in home game home game pretty easy 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.820
 the lynx you have to keep in mind 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.740
 this teacher has it as his goal 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.539
 set to catch a student 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.829
 that's why he has a few tricks of his own 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.869
 to weigh the students in safety 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.670
 and then strike 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.750
 Here we show you a realistic one 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.450
 example, some were the world easy 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.819

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.439
 the hiker of the heaviest teacher type 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.450
 here's plenty of facilities 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.159
 This teacher is constantly in motion, he 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.090
 runs through the rows he gets up 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.490
 once in front of you 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 next to you or unpredictably 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.990
 behind you if you always look at him 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.990
 want to have that is very noticeable 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 stalker prevails so there is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.810
 usually you can go to court there 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.390
 really get such a deal 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 but teachers are of course not involved 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.790

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.300
 The seat should be this right 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.810
 are dangerous and which you prefer 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.459
