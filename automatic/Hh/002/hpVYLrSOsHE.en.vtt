00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.830
 I hope you are well that we are 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.619
 found for the player of view of robin 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.510
 van persie the Dutch striker 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.460
 manchester united you see the team 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.490
 So this is my usual except that 1 league 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.560
 well, I put the three in front of gmi young 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.029
 van persie and nani for them to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.100
 found at 10.2 collective since I have 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.869
 put an English coach at the level of 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.670
 individual stats stats 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.050
 individual statin game earlier 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.370
 you see what are in the process of 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.930
 scroll now so I invite you 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.330
 to be break if you do not have them 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.949
 finally if you want to see them under the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.530
 take the time and that's the 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.449
 look at the robin van persie that is 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.190
 what can be said of him so already a 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.979
 exceptional ball striking 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.989
 I think you've got it right now 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.580
 shows a little it shows that in the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.409
 review will have some big potatoes on 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.930
 first clip that means a lot of 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.960
 things yeah so here's a shot from 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.250
 ball an exceptional ball shot 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.780
 1.95 in finish so that in front 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.110
 the cages he's really very very good 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.670
 so you could see the long shots 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.930
 very big stats in very big cat 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.610
 stats in hitting power 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.920
 I think that right now it's one of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.710
 players that I tested who sent me 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.479
 the biggest parts of the game 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.310
 last time on balotelli I had farted 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.829
 a cable there is worse 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.229
 it's worse it's abused 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.100
 to abuse both the strike that he has but 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.090
 I liked it except that in fact I put 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.590
 a lot of goals with him you go 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.990
 to see the thing is actually about 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.380
 on the 11 12 matches that I did with 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.030
 in fact I scored on only six 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.439
 matches so that and I scored 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 a lot on the six matches the trick 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.829
 it's actually that it's regular it's 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.810
 there are games he'll tell you you're going 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.609
 not see him in the match and a 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.159
 blow he'll come in a match admits 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.659
 a quadruplet like that you feel you're 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.920
 insulting match before the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.390
 match after tomorrow has quadrupled 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.950
 so it's true that I find it pretty 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.929
 regular I find it's not a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.380
 player who is really going to wear your 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.759
 team 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.150
 even if on a match that's it 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.460
 able to do the diff after 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.230
 that's how I explained to you it's 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 adidas irregularly actually following the 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.649
 games so at the points level 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 positive as I explained the power 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.220
 striking the finish and 1.95 in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.060
 finish which makes it low that's 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.860
 very good in front of the cages 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 he has both feet 4 stars bad 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.980
 foot they were going technical gesture has very 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.470
 early a technical gesture even if it's 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.380
 true that technically I did not get out of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.850
 big stuff with him besides the ronettes 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.470
 of shock the moment as you saw 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.680
 it's rather simple gestures that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.090
 I use to and then after the head game 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 then the game such play the midnight in the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 no more in the east - because I 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.230
 scored goals of the head with him if 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.610
 you balloon him on the head 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.080
 generally low it's going to be dangerous 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.030
 for the guardians that and that there is rather 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650
 a good precision but that stats in 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.790
 jump and completely yucky ending 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.690
 to talk about it again when I was talking about the points 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.100
 negative 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.390
 his speed the same I had said in 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.800
 the most nor in the east - because it is 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.750
 able to take speed a dani 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.550
 alves but to be caught by a 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.410
 e mail this message is absolutely not 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.640
 understood what was happening i 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.170
 absolutely not understand what was going on 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.390
 I made matches I just farted a 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.310
 cable its pass quality and just 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.350
 amazing must say what is a quality 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.550
 really remarkable password 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.510
 the kicks stopped then the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.739
 set robin van kicks 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 persie it's a mouse then there are the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.250
 free kicks even if that and I have not 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 illustrated I have not had the opportunity in 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.640
 the illustrated he has good stats in coup 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.230
 franc it stretches at age the size 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.340
 I like the way of shooting 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.680
 the talent sda ie you shoot in 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.959
 force without questioning the shots 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 francs he really stretches very very well 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.019
 I did I did shoot 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.130
 free-throws thanks because that and 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.190
 I had trouble finding it in the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.620
 repair surface and beats it stretches 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.570
 really good then what else 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.709
 there are the penalties the spelling is 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.330
 not one but he has a good stat in 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.800
 penalty but good after I could not 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
 the illustrated after the penaltys as game 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.019
 as I often say it's really 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.940
 random but that's ok after ccc plus 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.160
 it's really big for him there 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.410
 where what I mentioned is really 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.850
 very heavy that after him in 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.049
 is - so I will say the price then 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.050
 the price it with me I do not have to pay 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.300
 because I did or pink slip may 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.510
 here's a hundred and thirty thousand credit for 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.620
 a player certainly very good but percent 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.810
 thirty thousand credit I think you can 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.010
 to have better especially in 1st league in 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.870
 first league for one hundred and thirty thousand 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.840
 for less than 130 thousand credits a luis 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.380
 suarez who is for me at the top 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.910
 really above robin van persie 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.230
 even if he remains very good here 130 me 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.030
 crazy I think it's too expensive so 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.700
 for me it's already lowered its rating 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.530
 after that stats in jump and stats in 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 balance that I really find I 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.470
 find it really hard to hold 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.910
 on his legs and stats in strength 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.500
 rather correct but I mini them in 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.710
 no more in the east - because that's it 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 it was enough it was enough 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.830
 freestyle on that side as I say 1 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.780
 then move a quiz does not move 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.280
 it is really too irregular like 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.080
 player and there we finish in beauty with 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.850
 the last clip of this review so 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.140
 again a missile I think that 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.360
 you saw that there was a lot of 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.670
 heavy hit with him I took some 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.350
 pleasure with for that side there 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.330
 side big potato but I lost not 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.470
 evil of matches project on the matches 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.880
 that I did for the magazine I said 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.250
 no more than half so that's saying 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.450
 that ben I still had trouble 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.610
 robin van persie and so we see the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.890
 balance sheet so in the most the shots of 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.390
 foot stopped effects volleying 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.340
 the vision of the game that is really very 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.570
 very good combines with its quality of 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.550
 passes it really makes it sends 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.560
 really patches his finish these 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.810
 ball checks the long shot the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.340
 responsiveness the positioning that makes 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.960
 ball calls really well the 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.940
 often well placed at the same time he a 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.550
 strong offensive contribution and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.290
 defensive the bass if I say no 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.700
 nonsense the four stars bad foot 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.030
 quality passes the power of 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.410
 strikes 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.050
 the four-star technical gesture and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.120
 then in the east - prices finally 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.560
 the price that I find 330000 credit 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.570
 while you have a much less suarez 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.690
 dear I find it abused 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.530
 then jump the stat in sauce and to 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.169
 his balance 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.669
 you see the record with 11 games 18 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.100
 goals 4 assists so a balance sheet 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.140
 really really good with and so I 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.730
 put the rating of 18 out of 20 that was it 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.860
 bland less 80 hd I hope this 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.360
 robin van persie's review pleased you if 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.640
 she pleased you as davin you put a 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.020
 green thumb you have me a comment do you 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.060
 good at the chain if it's not already 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.800
 do I tell you next 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.890
 people take care of you by all the 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.890
 world
