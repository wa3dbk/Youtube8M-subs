00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.910
 swing back home 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.730
 is it possible whether it is necessary and whether 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.520
 This current, I will say so better to download 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 back at home than not to rock me 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 name is dmitry glebov and this is my year 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.529
 which is created to help 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.410
 you become healthier stronger and more beautiful and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 so find time to train 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 you can always place your home with you too 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.719
 there you can equip a small one there 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.540
 you can get a little room in the attic 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 in the basement in the garret 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 let me please if you remember arnold 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 Schwarzenegger trained in the tank somehow 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.010
 served in the army and he did it before 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.340
 rise that is up to 6 in the morning woke up 45 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 I climbed into a tank and trained there 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.640
 there is a place and time you can always find 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 your main desire is to train and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 back to pump at home you can or at least 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 to tone 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 how to do it as effectively as possible I 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.900
 you and tell you in this video actually 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 for this she and recorded and so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 I finish the conversation and start doing 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 The first exercise of our complex is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 australian pull-ups or 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.890
 pulling to the chest with a wide grip 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.170
 performed on this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.869
 difficult modern home 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 simulator drove the starting position as 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.820
 you see lying crossbar are on 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 level twist grip as wide as possible and 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.720
 isolated movement is not due to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.840
 work the biceps once by lowering 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:56.509
 elbows and flattening the blades raising our 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.509
 legs body can slightly bend the knees 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 like this so that the broadest joined in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.020
 work you need to strain it is to reduce them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.610
 shoulder blades lower elbows and try not to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.230
 use your biceps 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.820
 those pulling up it was first 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 exercise complex to perform 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.550
 the second will need dumbbells it will be 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 steps can be done like sitting like that 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.810
 here's a story like sitting here 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.770
 so sitting on the chair back straight 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:35.140
 their just so controlled movement 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.140
 raise your shoulders up and down 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.730
 try to carry out the movement of the variety 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.490
 shrug and cover there and bend your arms in 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.770
 elbows 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:54.100
 only the upper point shoulders work 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.100
 pause 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:10.030
 you can perform this exercise while standing 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.500
 might look the same as Australian 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.610
 pulling up that scars amount 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.610
 repetitions 12-15 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:27.129
 next exercise with dumbbells too 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:32.439
 dumbbell to the belt in the slope 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.690
 one-handed stool us 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:40.209
 left side work left hand means 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.609
 but front right foot hand left foot 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:48.450
 11th century freely we take a dumbbell in front 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:55.409
 By this we do not forget that your back is 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:01.750
 bend in the lower back is a dumbbell 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:05.879
 in an ordinary hand, look forward and powerful 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.879
 movement theanine dumbbells to the belt 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.220
 could and should rise a little higher than the shoulder 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:36.569
 the most common mistake in this 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 exercise, in addition to the back is rounded 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.419
 movement performed by the biceps 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.690
 You can often see how to take dumbbells 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.139
 like so drawn in favor or even breasts 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.680
 and more that is it is not exactly what 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.150
 you need 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.669
 here you will feel like 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.150
 tense biceps first of all we 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:02.169
 perform not such a movement and assignments 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.740
 back and up 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:15.639
 about lord us focus on elbows 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:20.409
 lead completed 12 15 reps for 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.449
 one hand fell for the second the next 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.380
 exercise will also be with dumbbells this 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:30.699
 there will be a dumbbell thrust to the chest standing up straight 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:34.840
 arms stretched out in a line like this 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 looks like bend in the lower back slightly 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.389
 bend your knees deviate approximately 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.599
 30 degrees and perform dumbbell traction 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:47.020
 but do not repent in the previous 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.060
 exercise but to the chest but again 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.430
 construction not biceps 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:58.030
 and lift your elbows up and reduce 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.449
 shoulder blades the top point here so slightly 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.820
 build boats and lift elbows 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.000
 up 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:13.949
 draw minimal biceps and reduce 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.949
 scapula feel muscles tense 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:26.440
 once again try not to pull the dumbbells here 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.440
 so using biceps and boiled 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.970
 choice of movement also ranges from 12 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.950
 up to 15 reps and last exercise 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:48.350
 complex to mention and strengthen the muscles 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.250
 the lower back will reverse hyperextension 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:56.770
 here our most difficult equipment 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:07:00.740
 here is which every home in rare 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.720
 lay down on them like legs were on 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.850
 the floor 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:19.610
 to hold on 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:22.760
 spoons of vodka to bespal too high 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.760
 lift your legs do not need tension will 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.260
 to be felt even if raised on 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.970
 a small corner here is an exercise number 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:37.730
 smoothly finishes the exercise without jerking 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:40.660
 inhaling steam here and pour out again in a circle 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.370
 To the implementation of the complex I start with 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:49.190
 pull-ups and preservation over the years 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:53.510
 circle here 3 such circle will take you 10 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:56.240
 15 minutes well, and over the back in a thick 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.340
 their help will bring an exercise for 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.540
 other muscle groups that can 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.680
 effectively perform at home see others 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.200
