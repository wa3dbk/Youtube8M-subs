little piece of open secret that I made
it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
it
there<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.320> no<00:00:22.439> specific<00:00:22.680> reason<00:00:23.130> why<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> made

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
there was no specific reason why I made

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.730 
there was no specific reason why I made
it<00:00:24.029> look<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it look like this but this kind of a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
it look like this but this kind of a
design<00:00:26.090> if<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.390> call<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.900> makes

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
design if you want to call it that makes

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.890 
design if you want to call it that makes
it<00:00:28.470> easier<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.220> projection<00:00:29.810> even<00:00:30.810> if

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it easier to see the projection even if

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.760 
it easier to see the projection even if
your<00:00:31.080> room<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.520> well<00:00:32.520> let<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> idea<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
your room is well let the idea is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.530 
your room is well let the idea is
obviously<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.219> mine<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.850> find<00:00:36.090> tons<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
obviously not mine you can find tons of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
obviously not mine you can find tons of
videos<00:00:36.780> about<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.090> what<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> did

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
videos about how to make this what I did

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
videos about how to make this what I did
was<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.110> literally<00:00:40.649> enlarged<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.730> tried<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
was I literally enlarged it and tried it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
was I literally enlarged it and tried it
at<00:00:42.450> various<00:00:42.930> resolutions<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:43.890> laptop<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
at various resolutions on my laptop to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
at various resolutions on my laptop to
make<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> most<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:46.170> wanted<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
make the most out of it I just wanted to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.400 
make the most out of it I just wanted to
have<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bigger<00:00:46.980> screen<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.989> than<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> movie

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
have a bigger screen than than a movie

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.189 
have a bigger screen than than a movie
screen<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.760> how<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.149> actually<00:00:51.989> looks

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
screen and see how it actually looks

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.790 
screen and see how it actually looks
like<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.969> simple<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
like it's so simple to make this out of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.430 
like it's so simple to make this out of
literally<00:00:56.340> anything<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.719> could<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> find

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
literally anything that I could not find

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.709 
literally anything that I could not find
any<00:00:58.649> reason<00:00:58.739> why<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> should<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.670> try<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
any reason why I should not try this and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.380 
any reason why I should not try this and
see<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.250> gives<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> truly

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
see if it really gives you that truly

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.260 
see if it really gives you that truly
amazing<00:01:03.960> holographic<00:01:04.650> vision<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
amazing holographic vision what you can

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the frame and I have been using four

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.550 
the frame and I have been using four
plastic<00:01:17.009> CD<00:01:17.520> cover<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.930> make<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.320> main

plastic CD cover to make the main
pyramid<00:01:19.860> display<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pyramid display out of it and a bit of a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.310 
pyramid display out of it and a bit of a
seller<00:01:22.409> tape<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.950> fit<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> pieces<00:01:23.460> together

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
seller tape to fit the pieces together

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
seller tape to fit the pieces together
now<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.340> careful<00:01:26.520> when

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
now you have to be really careful when

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
now you have to be really careful when
you<00:01:26.909> cut<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> CD<00:01:27.689> cover<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.140> very<00:01:28.350> hard

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you cut them to CD cover it's very hard

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
you cut them to CD cover it's very hard
material<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:30.540> breaks<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:30.960> easily<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
material and it breaks very easily I

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.330 
material and it breaks very easily I
would<00:01:32.640> suggest<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.259> saw<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
would suggest to use as little saw to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.569 
would suggest to use as little saw to
cut<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> shapes<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:37.979> more

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
cut the shapes out this way it's more

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.700 
cut the shapes out this way it's more
secure<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> efficient<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
secure and efficient to use than the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.440 
secure and efficient to use than the
utility<00:01:40.860> knives<00:01:41.340> I've<00:01:41.579> seen<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
utility knives I've seen on some of the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
utility knives I've seen on some of the
other<00:01:42.570> videos<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.470> easy<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
other videos it's really easy to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
other videos it's really easy to
actually<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:45.030> actually<00:01:45.299> break<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
actually to actually break this and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.530 
actually to actually break this and
there<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.470> cut<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:46.829> finger<00:01:47.540> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
there to actually cut your finger and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.670 
there to actually cut your finger and
obviously<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.340> really<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
obviously you don't really want that

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.080 
obviously you don't really want that
measurement<00:01:52.680> why<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.250> bottom<00:01:53.549> base<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
measurement why is the bottom base of a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.870 
measurement why is the bottom base of a
triangle<00:01:54.649> I've<00:01:55.649> been<00:01:55.950> using<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.549> 12

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
triangle I've been using it's 12

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.709 
triangle I've been using it's 12
centimeter<00:01:57.450> long<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:59.040> 8<00:01:59.579> 4<00:02:00.420> point

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
centimeter long so it's about 8 4 point

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.590 
centimeter long so it's about 8 4 point
8<00:02:01.079> inches<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.759> height<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> triangle

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
8 inches and the height of the triangle

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.770 
8 inches and the height of the triangle
is<00:02:04.200> 8<00:02:05.070> point<00:02:05.310> 5<00:02:05.640> centimeter<00:02:05.880> which<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.570> about

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is 8 point 5 centimeter which is about

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.260 
is 8 point 5 centimeter which is about
three<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:08.270> four<00:02:09.349> inches<00:02:10.349> long<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.790> can

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
three point four inches long you can

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
three point four inches long you can
change<00:02:12.599> these<00:02:12.870> however<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
change these however you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
change these however you
and<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.910> make<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> larger<00:02:15.720> or

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and if you want to make a larger or

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.410 
and if you want to make a larger or
smaller<00:02:15.900> pyramid<00:02:16.860> by<00:02:17.010> duplicating<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.910> having

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
smaller pyramid by duplicating or having

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.060 
smaller pyramid by duplicating or having
these<00:02:18.540> number<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.350> example<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> smaller

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
these number so for example a smaller

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.270 
these number so for example a smaller
triangle<00:02:20.490> base<00:02:21.590> could<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.950> six

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
triangle base could be like six

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.400 
triangle base could be like six
centimeters<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.060> half<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> top<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
centimeters so half of the top of the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.370 
centimeters so half of the top of the
base<00:02:25.590> right<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.130> which<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.850> about<00:02:27.140> 2.4<00:02:28.140> inch

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
base right now which is about 2.4 inch

1.7<00:02:34.560> inch<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:36.360> case<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.690> want<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.020> really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
1.7 inch in case you want to be really

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.040 
1.7 inch in case you want to be really
precise<00:02:38.270> once<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> triangles

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
precise once you have the triangles

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.770 
precise once you have the triangles
ready<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:41.040> grab<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> pop<00:02:41.550> cardboard<00:02:42.090> paper<00:02:42.300> box

a<00:02:43.140> seller<00:02:43.620> tape<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.690> actually<00:02:45.960> fix<00:02:46.500> your

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
a seller tape and you actually fix your

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.300 
a seller tape and you actually fix your
pyramid<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> cardboard<00:02:48.180> box<00:02:49.310> I've

can basically do the same on the other

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.210 
can basically do the same on the other
side<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.540> ensure<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.740> watch<00:03:02.010> the

YouTube<00:03:07.680> allows<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.220> use<00:03:08.400> these<00:03:08.550> books<00:03:08.760> in

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
YouTube allows you to use these books in

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.630 
YouTube allows you to use these books in
two<00:03:09.120> different<00:03:09.300> ways<00:03:10.160> one<00:03:11.160> way<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.370> when<00:03:11.550> you

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
two different ways one way is when you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.490 
two different ways one way is when you
tablet<00:03:12.000> or<00:03:12.150> laptop<00:03:12.330> screen<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.930> actually<00:03:13.380> on

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
tablet or laptop screen is actually on

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.530 
tablet or laptop screen is actually on
the<00:03:13.650> bottom<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.850> place<00:03:15.180> your

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the bottom and you place your

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.620 
the bottom and you place your
holographic<00:03:16.230> display<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.160> top<00:03:17.630> creating

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
holographic display on the top creating

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.770 
holographic display on the top creating
an<00:03:18.720> upside-down<00:03:19.050> pyramid<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:21.180> enables<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
an upside-down pyramid this enables you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.390 
an upside-down pyramid this enables you
to<00:03:21.810> play<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.290> video<00:03:22.410> as<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.250> my

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
to play the video as you can see in my

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.760 
to play the video as you can see in my
previous<00:03:23.790> recordings<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.350> other<00:03:25.470> way<00:03:25.650> is

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
previous recordings the other way is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.199 
previous recordings the other way is
obviously<00:03:26.160> when<00:03:26.310> your<00:03:26.430> tablet<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:26.880> laptop

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
obviously when your tablet or laptop

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.620 
obviously when your tablet or laptop
screens<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.260> top<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.590> your<00:03:28.739> display<00:03:29.630> there

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
screens on the top of your display there

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.530 
screens on the top of your display there
are<00:03:30.690> also<00:03:30.810> videos<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.590> kind<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.130> setup

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
are also videos for this kind of setup

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.030 
are also videos for this kind of setup
and<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.870> important<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.709> need<00:03:34.830> to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and it's important because you need to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800 
and it's important because you need to
have<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> right<00:03:35.550> perspective<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.540> don't

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
have the right perspective so you don't

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870 
have the right perspective so you don't
get<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.110> picture<00:03:37.470> upside<00:03:37.830> down<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.730> will

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
get the picture upside down but you will

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.680 
get the picture upside down but you will
see<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.180> later<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:40.770> my<00:03:41.220> video<00:03:41.690> I'm

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
see that later on in my my video I'm

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.380 
see that later on in my my video I'm
going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.050> show<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.320> both<00:03:43.739> perspectives

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
going to show you both perspectives

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.050 
going to show you both perspectives
shortly<00:03:45.709> some<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.920> referred<00:03:47.310> using<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
shortly some of it referred using the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.910 
shortly some of it referred using the
pyramid<00:03:48.360> upside<00:03:48.510> down<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.500> others<00:03:49.770> being

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
pyramid upside down and others being

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.620 
pyramid upside down and others being
used<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> tablet<00:03:50.700> on<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.910> top<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.239> their<00:03:51.390> holo

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
used the tablet on the top of their holo

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.420 
used the tablet on the top of their holo
screen<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.620> makes<00:03:52.920> some<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
screen this makes some of the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.370 
screen this makes some of the
projections<00:03:54.060> looking<00:03:54.450> much<00:03:54.660> better<00:03:54.930> because

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
projections looking much better because

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.090 
projections looking much better because
it<00:03:55.620> gives<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.459> kind<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.270> base<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.830> actual

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
it gives a kind of a base for the actual

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.780 
it gives a kind of a base for the actual
subject<00:03:59.489> so<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:01.470> example<00:04:01.830> if<00:04:01.920> two<00:04:02.130> people<00:04:02.520> are

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
subject so for example if two people are

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970 
subject so for example if two people are
dancing<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.959> does<00:04:04.290> look<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:04.950> are

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
dancing it does look like they are

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.130 
dancing it does look like they are
inside<00:04:05.459> your<00:04:05.760> hollow<00:04:06.000> screen<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.630> not<00:04:06.780> you

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
inside your hollow screen and not you

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.009 
inside your hollow screen and not you
know<00:04:07.200> hanging<00:04:07.830> in<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.190> air<00:04:08.480> but<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:09.900> again

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
know hanging in the air but then again

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.930 
know hanging in the air but then again
you<00:04:10.290> know<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.470> will<00:04:10.739> see<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.160> actually

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
you know you will see this actually

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
perspective where the laptop screen is

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.410 
perspective where the laptop screen is
actually<00:04:55.710> below<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.840> holo-pyramid<00:04:57.840> screen

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
actually below the holo-pyramid screen

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.100 
actually below the holo-pyramid screen
this<00:05:00.420> is<00:05:00.540> what<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.720> did<00:05:01.020> on<00:05:01.050> my<00:05:01.350> first<00:05:01.740> video<00:05:03.110> it

what you can play with is you know you

on your pyramid or triangle screen you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.680 
on your pyramid or triangle screen you
can<00:05:37.710> play<00:05:37.920> with<00:05:38.100> your<00:05:38.220> laptop's<00:05:38.730> resolution<00:05:39.480> I

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
can play with your laptop's resolution I

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.180 
can play with your laptop's resolution I
needed<00:05:40.410> to<00:05:40.530> actually<00:05:41.000> change<00:05:42.000> it<00:05:42.210> from<00:05:43.190> 1600

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
needed to actually change it from 1600

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:53.330 
needed to actually change it from 1600
by<00:05:44.780> 900<00:05:45.780> down<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:48.320> 1024<00:05:49.320> by<00:05:49.560> 600<00:05:51.170> 768<00:05:52.340> because

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
by 900 down to 1024 by 600 768 because

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.630 
by 900 down to 1024 by 600 768 because
the<00:05:53.610> actual<00:05:54.360> resolution<00:05:55.110> was<00:05:55.530> too<00:05:55.770> big<00:05:56.040> so<00:05:56.580> I

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
the actual resolution was too big so I

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.670 
the actual resolution was too big so I
need<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.940> lower<00:05:57.090> it<00:05:57.360> so<00:05:58.140> it<00:05:58.230> would<00:05:58.440> actually

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
need to lower it so it would actually

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.120 
need to lower it so it would actually
give<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.880> center<00:06:00.750> because<00:06:01.710> that's<00:06:01.860> where

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
give it a center because that's where

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.360 
give it a center because that's where
the<00:06:02.370> pyramids<00:06:03.240> talk<00:06:04.140> should<00:06:04.770> actually<00:06:04.950> point

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
the pyramids talk should actually point

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.530 
the pyramids talk should actually point
to<00:06:05.610> so<00:06:06.510> that's<00:06:07.320> one<00:06:07.710> of<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:08.070> perspective<00:06:09.000> we

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
to so that's one of the perspective we

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.760 
to so that's one of the perspective we
can<00:06:09.570> you<00:06:10.560> can<00:06:10.710> use<00:06:10.920> for<00:06:11.190> this<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:12.590> I'm<00:06:13.590> going

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
can you can use for this and I'm going

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.050 
can you can use for this and I'm going
to<00:06:13.830> show<00:06:14.070> you<00:06:14.160> guys<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.550> other<00:06:14.640> one<00:06:16.640> so<00:06:17.640> here

to show you guys the other one so here
is<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.390> projection<00:06:18.750> when<00:06:19.700> your<00:06:20.700> tablet<00:06:21.690> or
