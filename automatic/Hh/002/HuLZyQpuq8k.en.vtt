that feel is this is the type of input
lag<00:03:25.139> there<00:03:25.349> but<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> direct<00:03:26.280> feed<00:03:27.060> into

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
lag there but this is a direct feed into

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.970 
lag there but this is a direct feed into
the<00:03:27.540> system<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.109> once<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.440> plug<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.769> into

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the system so once you plug this into

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.539 
the system so once you plug this into
the<00:03:29.160> USB<00:03:29.700> port<00:03:29.819> one<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:30.780> two<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> ps3<00:03:31.769> it'll

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
the USB port one or two on the ps3 it'll

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.059 
the USB port one or two on the ps3 it'll
automatically<00:03:33.030> detected<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.750> if<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.829> if

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
automatically detected and if you can if

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.490 
automatically detected and if you can if
you<00:03:35.160> notice<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.639> has<00:03:35.669> player<00:03:36.120> 1<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.510> player<00:03:36.780> 2

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
you notice it has player 1 and player 2

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.009 
you notice it has player 1 and player 2
so<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.639> goes<00:03:38.880> directly<00:03:39.359> into<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.690> system

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
so this goes directly into the system

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.900 
so this goes directly into the system
now<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.859> make<00:03:41.010> sure<00:03:41.040> i've<00:03:41.519> noticed

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
ways I'm actually liking this a little

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.050 
ways I'm actually liking this a little
more<00:04:17.020> than<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.350> mad<00:04:17.500> catz<00:04:17.820> believe<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.880> or<00:04:18.970> not

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
more than the mad catz believe it or not

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.240 
more than the mad catz believe it or not
so<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:20.050> so<00:04:20.230> for<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.530> price<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.890> price<00:04:20.920> is
