 impact zone 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.999
 and many unanswered questions 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.629

 no one knows what 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:17.649
 After the 1997 accident the local authorities began to take 

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.649
 more seriously the warnings about UFOs uncles

 that crosses the center of puerto rico like the extraterrestrial route 303 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.990
 but for now other extraterrestrial affairs on the island claim the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.469
 immediate attention from experts 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.629
 from the hillsides that surround the zas the government usually throws a mysterious 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.629
 moored aerostatic balloon that carries a radar that reaches almost 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.819
 5 kilometers of altitude 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.939
 apparently its mission is to control traffic and time but ufologists 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.339
 that in that that is only a cover for its true function to observe and 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.339
 record any extraterrestrial activity 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 there is a government document 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.569
 in the legislature where a secret investigation was requested 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.550
 does not publish secrets 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.330
 about this UFO sightings charge percent to the waters 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.340
 but the document also says that they do not represent any danger to the 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.629
 humanity 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.839
 the volume of reports on hosni hundreds our little island 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.050
 has led many to consider the possibility that the depths that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.659
 open under the southern end of the Bermuda triangle next to the 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.659
 same coast hide something more than you x 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.639
 experts and ufologists around the world are convinced that it could 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.379
 harboring a whole base of these suspected appliances 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.330
 there is a pass 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.440
 for now they will focus between a palm tree 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.479
 from the area near Alvaro de Cabo Rojo 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.240
 these works a quite area from believes that it should appeal to a cartagena my 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.319
 friend to enter and exit lies as they operate and amen of the dock in which 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:04.759
 can 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.169
 while munar specific do not go out otherwise it's fine 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.499
 20 vila pass that come from below the unmsm all these events 2010 local 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.930
 merkel triangle possibilities that the expert 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.000
 in the popular strata of Puerto Rican culture most of the 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.900
 people though talk about their word and the triangle of Bermuda 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.130
 the night nothing of those very basic things or something else in all of it 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.819
 is a reality 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.599
 with the story that a reality is happening and there are many hundreds of 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.580
 testimony and clairvoyance but it demonstrates well 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.719
 I think it's going to come 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.279
 there I think it's a serious disease disease tie at home have 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.810
 given hundreds of houses that it's a reality
