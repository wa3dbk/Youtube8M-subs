00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
something that everybody raves about but

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.460 
something that everybody raves about but
when<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> first<00:02:36.310> tried<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.760> was<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.000> oh<00:02:37.470> like

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
when I first tried it I was like oh like

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.960 
when I first tried it I was like oh like
I<00:02:38.680> didn't<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.069> like<00:02:39.280> how<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.579> turned<00:02:39.610> out

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
I didn't really like how it turned out

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.759 
I didn't really like how it turned out
and<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.989> benefit<00:02:41.560> they're<00:02:41.739> real

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
and this is the benefit they're real

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.819 
and this is the benefit they're real
mascara<00:02:42.099> but<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:43.299> i<00:02:43.569> decided<00:02:43.870> i<00:02:44.230> was<00:02:44.769> going

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
mascara but then i decided i was going

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.710 
mascara but then i decided i was going
to<00:02:45.040> layer<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.459> something<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.390> my<00:02:46.510> all-time

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
to layer with something so my all-time

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.569 
to layer with something so my all-time
favorite<00:02:47.200> mascara<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.860> covergirl<00:02:48.310> clump

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
favorite mascara is the covergirl clump

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.400 
favorite mascara is the covergirl clump
crusher<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.209> i<00:02:49.810> think<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:50.380> really

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
crusher and i think it just like really

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.960 
crusher and i think it just like really
separates<00:02:51.069> your<00:02:51.190> lashes<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.700> i've<00:02:51.790> talked

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
separates your lashes and i've talked

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.000 
separates your lashes and i've talked
about<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:52.540> many<00:02:52.569> times<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.620> when<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> put

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
about it so many times but when you put

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.580 
about it so many times but when you put
this<00:02:54.310> over<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.150> really<00:02:55.660> volumizes<00:02:56.470> it

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
this over it it really volumizes it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.809 
this over it it really volumizes it
because<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.980> clump<00:02:57.190> crusher<00:02:57.280> doesn't<00:02:57.670> really

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
because the clump crusher doesn't really

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.150 
because the clump crusher doesn't really
give<00:02:57.970> volume<00:02:58.180> but<00:02:59.079> i<00:02:59.110> think<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.950> gives

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
give volume but i think this just gives

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.850 
give volume but i think this just gives
like<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> perfect<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:01.599> finishes<00:03:02.380> off<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
like the perfect like finishes off and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.680 
like the perfect like finishes off and
it<00:03:03.010> looks<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.670> good<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.180> I've<00:03:04.269> been<00:03:04.420> really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it looks so good so I've been really

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.509 
it looks so good so I've been really

and i think it just works really nice in
my<00:04:10.510> nails<00:04:10.810> I've<00:04:11.169> had<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.590> on<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.069> week

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
my nails I've had it on for like a week

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.250 
my nails I've had it on for like a week
and<00:04:12.459> it's<00:04:12.639> just<00:04:12.849> starting<00:04:13.269> to<00:04:13.299> chip<00:04:13.599> so<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:14.230> is

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
and it's just starting to chip so it is

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.080 
and it's just starting to chip so it is
a<00:04:14.349> really<00:04:14.470> good<00:04:14.829> quality<00:04:15.250> nail<00:04:15.430> polish<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:15.970> it

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
a really good quality nail polish but it

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.999 
a really good quality nail polish but it
doesn't<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:16.449> look<00:04:16.720> good<00:04:16.900> on<00:04:17.019> right<00:04:17.199> now<00:04:17.229> but

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
doesn't like look good on right now but

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.780 
doesn't like look good on right now but
it's<00:04:18.190> super

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
it's super

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.070 
it's super
pretty<00:04:18.910> yet<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.150> think<00:04:19.420> it's<00:04:19.540> just<00:04:19.690> really<00:04:19.900> nice

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
pretty yet I think it's just really nice

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.410 
pretty yet I think it's just really nice
for<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.380> fall<00:04:20.620> it's<00:04:21.520> not<00:04:21.640> like<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.880> dark<00:04:22.180> color

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
for the fall it's not like a dark color

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.240 
for the fall it's not like a dark color
but<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.080> think<00:04:23.410> since<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.830> just<00:04:24.070> like

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
but I think since it's just like

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.400 
but I think since it's just like
shimmery<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:24.880> brown<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.600> goes<00:04:25.990> good<00:04:26.170> with<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
shimmery and brown it goes good with the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.870 
shimmery and brown it goes good with the
fall<00:04:26.560> time<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.040> yeah<00:04:27.250> I've<00:04:27.430> really<00:04:27.760> been
