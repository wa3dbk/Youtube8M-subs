00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.050
 logical explanation 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.060
 the average Chilean is very square and not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.920
 is never released because if you always look 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 moments that justify dates 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.200

 the cups and handed to the boat 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 in this state the person can act 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 in various ways the drunk what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 transforms into that person piola removed 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 of bullaque at the time of taking the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 competed as it transforms the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 drunkard of rocker is that one that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.330
 turns into a kind of rambo or 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330
 Rocky Balboa 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 employ 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.980
 competing the depressive drunk that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 poor guy that alcohol product 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.060
 he begins to remember moments of the past 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.000
 because he does not go to the bar on the side of the bar 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.920
 Side of the bar next to Auntie's bar 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.390
 sonia soria 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 I am the one who wore 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:00.580
 but we will not cry my friend that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 it's called to play 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.220
 the drunkard stopped and is the one who has always 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.080
 had the singer complex and believe 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.030
 that sings very beautiful and when you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.030
 they spend the glasses makes show their talent 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.270

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:29.290
 for the best of my friends to play if 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 I was in the ass of my life better 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 good 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 applause the exhibitionist drunk is 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.650
 says that it is not known if product of the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.780
 He got very hot and gave him 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.480
 take off your clothes 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.480
 today in the babe is getting hot 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.459
 Hahaha 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.840
 the dancer is the one who took 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.200
 cohetitos and already dances like the colt 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.200
 wild 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.510
 but when 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.599
 the drunk furniture is that which is 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.970
 He passed a little hand and has already passed 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.970
 be part of the setting of the place 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.209
 The question now is how you realize 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.620
 when you are already very drunk some 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.460
 Chilean methods are the following 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.470
 do the 4 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.540
 good 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.540
 You can not say some phrases like 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540
 do not 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.550
 and if it is glorious 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 or it could happen that that person who 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.629
 when it reaches the reel in 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.079
 contrast so ugly that it even took away your 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.670
 hiccup 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.700
 now it turns out that it is richer in the 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.769
 bank in yangzhou but certainly the best 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.390
