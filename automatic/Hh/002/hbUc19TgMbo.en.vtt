00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.700

 neat few bluffed and the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.640
 like 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 finished me here I do not know but I tried 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 already here if you want the position of two 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 I go all over the game game income more 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.440
 less k this card had which you can 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.190
 even the position was bad 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.190
 come in but nobody wants to do 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.989
 your hand at all sitting such an eccentric 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.989
 can not it comes incomprehensibly how 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:18.390
 I sit not position 98 came 76 10 here I 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 I have decided to make a check to see him 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.009
 the reaction 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.600
 he cost 60 chips in general very little 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 the bank is far away lies I yes yes I do not know 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.939
 6 girls call the turn he decided 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 tempered then add 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:45.840
 Well, here I decided to put a little 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:51.770
 more than half of the chips are such 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 i have 6 7 8 9 10 what's he got there 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:05.539
 Which card to click most likely on 10 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:05.539
 before the guy got the same department 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.579
 Well, the late position of the 10th year can 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.819
 play look will develop 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.819
 developments 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:47.620
 royal play such a tedious tei type 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.790
 name principle is it in principle if he has 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.570
 have he go singing 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.630
 and if there is nothing but how much ideal 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:00.280
 never showed a map yet sky 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.240
 We left four people game became 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.420
 still at the bottom 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.360
 everyone is already nobody wants to risk 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.300
 all very this one on the right side which 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.940
 Now dividing pair Well, actually comes very 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.880
 Rarely so it is not clear how to play 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 then I just decided to check and that's it 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.660
 incomprehensible how that game goes on and here 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.060
 I decided to put in that little 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.770
 look or someone will be strong 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.970
 raise they will just throw cards 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:40.330
 I'm older all 50 chips between dozens 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:44.350
 Well, so I came out of the battle so that comrade 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.920
 on the left side did not put there anymore 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.920
 what is necessary 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.400
 but two lines 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:04:00.909
 This 4 Pyaterochka still cross in general 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.319
 decided to put these three cross but 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.209
 last positions 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.969
 here is a small decided to put the last 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:15.090
 the players are neat now to attention 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.090
 what they decided to just reset the port 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.090
 all different i was the small blind 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.190
 the person next to me is sitting on a big 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:43.840
 the blind came just to play and ride 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:48.420
 I got a card that I have a nine 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:52.680
 nine share either just 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.680
 this is as if ended 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.690
 the game generally dragged on and we are very long 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:11.410
 especially when the three of us stayed 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:14.280
 in general , I was just unbearably steam 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.260
 a dozen yes we 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.110
 what is possible that its just not sitting positions 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.780
 for the plan teasing will then look 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.400
 video and there like water see here on 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.430
 early positions and generally very rarely 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.430
 also plays here such a game 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:52.540
 crazy post too put there 100 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:55.150
 chips with stockings wanted to give me here 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:02.040
 you can see what will happen next 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:06.540
 the last position I sit money back and forth 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.540
 entered insert incomprehensible
