00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.340
 hello everyone in this video we're going to 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.340
 prepare three drinks for this summer 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.849
 let's put ice in a glass of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.440
 crystal cut a little apple 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.440
 green we will put in the case 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:28.490
 we will squeeze a file and add it 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.989
 sprite seven there was some drink of this 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.379
 style is new life your profile is removed 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.379
 what will you like according to your list 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.309
 the following subjective that I love 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 for the mornings because it's super 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.770
 perfect 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.629
 and we do it by putting more or less the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.920
 amount of milk that we can put a 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.550
 glass about 250 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.290
 a banana or two depends on the grains 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.290
 it can be very mature 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 and a spoonful of butter of 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.780
 peanut if the bananas are not 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.710
 fully mature we can always add 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 a little honey 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 we beat 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.010
 we cut some slices of banana for 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.010
 decorate 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.510
 and we have it 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.210
 the next is a super pink lemonade 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.160
 good first let's squeeze lemons 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 until you get 100 milliliters of juice 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.580
 of lemon 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.000
 i 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.460
 once we have it we put in a saucepan 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.780
 to the fire the lemon juice half a liter of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.000
 water and also 100 grams of sugar what 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.430
 we will have on fire until it is put 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.050
 to boil once it is already boiling 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.890
 let's remove from the fire and let's leave 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.890
 let it cool 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 once it's cold we'll mix it with 60 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.790
 milliliters of cranberry juice that is 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.739
 what is going to make it have that color 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.840
 pink and we can already serve it with 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.840
 slices of lemon and some ice 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.209
 it seems perfect for me to eat for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.099

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.790
