 Hey Mina, you do not know the lack that makes me come back with me and do not ever leave me anymore 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.470
 You choose me to be your husband, above all, I'll be your friend. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.189
 I just want your peace, your love and nothing else comes with me, I'm good boy 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 If one day you feel like crying remember me, call me ok ?! 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.090
 I do not promise that I'll make you smile but if I'm going to cry with you, I'm here. 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 So .. You are my good, my beautiful, dengosa Do not want another someone, just want your good 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 [Chorus]

 I do not want anybody else, I just want your good 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 When the longing to squeeze leaves the pride aside 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.060

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.250

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.780
 Please do not do this cowardice I think of you night and night and day 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.099
 And I stay here in this boredom will she know that she is my medicine?
