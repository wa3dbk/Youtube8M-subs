00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:13.119 
ways that you can do this is by

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.119 
ways that you can do this is by
experimenting<00:00:14.020> with<00:00:14.260> different<00:00:14.410> mouthpiece

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129

Reed and ligature combinations now
there's<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.580> lot<00:00:18.760> in<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:18.970> way<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.119> resources

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
there's a lot in the way of resources

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.780 
there's a lot in the way of resources
available<00:00:19.960> on<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.590> web<00:00:20.770> but<00:00:21.130> shall<00:00:21.400> aim<00:00:21.580> to

now<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.910> let's<00:00:31.119> take<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.420> mouthpiece<00:00:31.600> first

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
now so let's take the mouthpiece first

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.500 
now so let's take the mouthpiece first
of<00:00:32.320> all<00:00:32.469> now<00:00:33.460> it's<00:00:33.640> easy<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:34.000> get<00:00:34.300> confused

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
of all now it's easy to get confused

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.479 
of all now it's easy to get confused
with<00:00:35.020> all<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.260> different<00:00:35.500> terminology<00:00:36.460> out

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
with all the different terminology out

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.790 
with all the different terminology out
there<00:00:36.880> but<00:00:37.540> one<00:00:37.660> of<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.870> important<00:00:38.320> concepts

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
there but one of the important concepts

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.410 
there but one of the important concepts
I<00:00:38.890> want<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.250> get<00:00:39.400> your<00:00:39.520> head<00:00:39.730> round<00:00:39.910> now<00:00:40.180> is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
I want you to get your head round now is

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.530 
I want you to get your head round now is
that<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.470> tip<00:00:41.710> opening<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.270> tip

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
that of the tip opening now the tip

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.800 
that of the tip opening now the tip
opening<00:00:43.720> is<00:00:44.170> quite<00:00:44.860> simply<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.550> gap<00:00:46.149> between

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
opening is quite simply the gap between

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.410 
opening is quite simply the gap between
the<00:00:47.110> tip<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.710> reed<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.550> tip<00:00:48.790> of<00:00:48.970> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
the tip of the reed and the tip of the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.290 
the tip of the reed and the tip of the
mouthpiece<00:00:49.570> is<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:51.160> actual<00:00:51.579> size<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:51.880> the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
mouthpiece is the actual size of the

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.910 
mouthpiece is the actual size of the
hole<00:00:52.630> that<00:00:52.899> you're<00:00:53.020> actually<00:00:53.290> blowing<00:00:53.500> arrow

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
hole that you're actually blowing arrow

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.389 
hole that you're actually blowing arrow
down<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:55.050> typically<00:00:56.050> as<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.260> beginner<00:00:56.739> you

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
down and typically as a beginner you

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
down and typically as a beginner you
would<00:00:57.520> start<00:00:57.820> out<00:00:58.000> with<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.270> small<00:00:58.719> tip<00:00:58.930> opening

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
would start out with a small tip opening

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.760 
would start out with a small tip opening
perhaps<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.460> three<00:01:00.790> or<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.059> four<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.750> then<00:01:02.680> you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
perhaps a three or a four and then you

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.009 
perhaps a three or a four and then you
progress<00:01:03.040> on<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:04.030> something<00:01:04.329> like<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.509> six<00:01:04.869> or

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
progress on to something like a six or

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.499 
progress on to something like a six or
seven<00:01:05.409> so<00:01:06.219> the<00:01:06.399> tip<00:01:06.579> opening<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:07.119> actually

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
seven so the tip opening is actually

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.629 
seven so the tip opening is actually
represented<00:01:08.259> by<00:01:08.469> a<00:01:08.499> number<00:01:08.889> or<00:01:09.249> a<00:01:09.310> letter

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:09.639 
represented by a number or a letter

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.120 
represented by a number or a letter
which<00:01:10.389> is<00:01:10.539> printed<00:01:10.840> onto<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.469> size<00:01:11.709> of<00:01:12.009> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
which is printed onto the size of the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.010 
which is printed onto the size of the
mouthpiece<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.270> idea<00:01:13.539> is<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.719> when<00:01:13.899> you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
mouthpiece and the idea is that when you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.410 
mouthpiece and the idea is that when you
progress<00:01:14.469> onto<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.950> larger<00:01:15.369> tip<00:01:15.549> opening<00:01:15.729> you

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
progress onto a larger tip opening you

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.629 
progress onto a larger tip opening you
in<00:01:16.539> turn<00:01:16.810> produce<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.409> broader<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.039> fuller

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
in turn produce a broader and fuller

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.899 
in turn produce a broader and fuller
sound<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.770> one<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.189> other<00:01:21.219> things<00:01:21.729> to

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
sound now one of the other things to

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.879 
sound now one of the other things to
take<00:01:22.090> into<00:01:22.299> consideration<00:01:22.499> is<00:01:23.499> the<00:01:23.529> actual

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
take into consideration is the actual

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.889 
take into consideration is the actual
material<00:01:24.429> that<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.819> mouthpiece<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.569> made

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
material that the mouthpiece is made

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.529 
material that the mouthpiece is made
from<00:01:26.170> whether<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.920> be<00:01:27.009> plastic<00:01:27.639> urbanite

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
from whether it be plastic urbanite

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.010 
from whether it be plastic urbanite
which<00:01:28.959> is<00:01:29.109> to<00:01:29.229> say<00:01:29.380> hard<00:01:29.679> rubber<00:01:29.979> or<00:01:30.249> metal<00:01:31.119> but

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
which is to say hard rubber or metal but

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.749 
which is to say hard rubber or metal but
generally<00:01:32.469> speaking<00:01:32.499> I<00:01:33.039> wouldn't<00:01:33.369> advise

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
generally speaking I wouldn't advise

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.269 
generally speaking I wouldn't advise
metal<00:01:34.359> for<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.689> complete<00:01:35.049> beginner<00:01:35.259> as<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.130> can

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
metal for a complete beginner as it can

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.399 
metal for a complete beginner as it can
be<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> lot<00:01:36.549> louder<00:01:36.969> and<00:01:37.450> harder<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.079> control

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
be a lot louder and harder to control

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.309 
be a lot louder and harder to control
and<00:01:38.999> but<00:01:39.999> it<00:01:40.119> might<00:01:40.299> be<00:01:40.450> an<00:01:40.539> option<00:01:40.929> for<00:01:40.959> you<00:01:41.109> as
