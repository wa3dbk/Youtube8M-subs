2<00:00:20.010> class<00:00:20.250> setup<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.730> never<00:00:21.630> thought<00:00:21.720> I'd<00:00:21.930> be

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
2 class setup I never thought I'd be

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
2 class setup I never thought I'd be
doing<00:00:22.109> one<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> these<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.980> don't<00:00:23.519> know<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> just

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
doing one of these I don't know I just

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.769 
doing one of these I don't know I just
never<00:00:23.850> understood<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.330> point<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> class

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
never understood the point of class

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.330 
never understood the point of class
setups<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.230> most<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.560> class<00:00:25.800> honestly

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
setups because most of my class honestly

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.029 
setups because most of my class honestly
are<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.640> pretty<00:00:27.180> much<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> same<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.470> uh<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
are all pretty much the same but uh you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.900 
are all pretty much the same but uh you
know<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.310> never<00:00:29.490> thought<00:00:29.670> I'd<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.789> doing

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
know and I never thought I'd be doing

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.519 
know and I never thought I'd be doing
one<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.420> game<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.109> game<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
one on this game because this game is so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
one on this game because this game is so
old<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.160> said<00:00:32.219> people<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> asked<00:00:33.270> me

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
old but like I said people have asked me

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
old but like I said people have asked me
to<00:00:33.360> doing<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.140> i<00:00:34.170> am<00:00:34.230> doing<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.710> um<00:00:35.579> so

to doing so here i am doing one um so
let's<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.059> jump<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.989> really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
let's just jump into it this really

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.510 
let's just jump into it this really
shouldn't<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> long<00:00:37.800> video<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.430> i

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
shouldn't be a long video because like i

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
shouldn't be a long video because like i
said<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.090> stuff<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> same<00:00:39.930> but

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
said a lot of my stuff is the same but

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
said a lot of my stuff is the same but
so<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.309> first<00:00:41.460> class<00:00:41.640> um<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:43.020> ballistic

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so for my first class um is my ballistic

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.299 
so for my first class um is my ballistic
class<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.800> run<00:00:43.950> FMJ<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.920> extended<00:00:46.920> mags<00:00:47.100> on

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
class I run FMJ and and extended mags on

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
class I run FMJ and and extended mags on
it<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.480> i<00:00:49.230> mainly<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.860> class<00:00:50.070> for

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it and I i mainly use this class for

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.170 
it and I i mainly use this class for
team<00:00:50.399> deathmatch<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:50.940> why<00:00:51.030> has

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
team deathmatch that's why has

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.790 
team deathmatch that's why has
lightweight<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.809> toughness<00:00:52.260> instead<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
lightweight and toughness instead of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.260 
lightweight and toughness instead of
hardwired<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> flak<00:00:53.550> jacket<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.120> next

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
hardwired and flak jacket like my next

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.959 
hardwired and flak jacket like my next
class<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.320> yeah<00:00:55.739> i<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.829> run<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.399> 23<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
class but yeah i just run a be 23 you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
class but yeah i just run a be 23 you
know<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.420> pretty<00:00:57.600> simple<00:00:57.899> lightweight<00:00:58.739> fast

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
know it's pretty simple lightweight fast

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
know it's pretty simple lightweight fast
hands<00:00:59.579> attack<00:00:59.969> mask<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.809> be

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
hands attack mask pretty much gonna be

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
hands attack mask pretty much gonna be
all<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.440> classes<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.520> I'll<00:01:02.609> do

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
all in all my classes but what I'll do

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
all in all my classes but what I'll do
sometimes<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.420> shot<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
sometimes my shot is really on and like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980 
sometimes my shot is really on and like
I'm<00:01:04.650> really<00:01:04.830> fast<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.600> I'll<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:06.960> my

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'm really fast as I I'll take off my

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'm really fast as I I'll take off my
pistol<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.830> FMJ<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:09.450> I'll<00:01:09.570> throw<00:01:09.780> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
pistol and FMJ and then I'll throw on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
pistol and FMJ and then I'll throw on
perk<00:01:10.260> 3<00:01:10.560> greed<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.890> author<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.220> dexterity<00:01:11.700> as

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
perk 3 greed and author on dexterity as

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
perk 3 greed and author on dexterity as
well<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.750> makes<00:01:12.990> me<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.200> bit

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
well it just makes me a little bit

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.980 
well it just makes me a little bit
faster<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.950> uh<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.600> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
faster and uh I don't know it's it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.120 
faster and uh I don't know it's it's
hard<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> explain<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
hard to explain it's just up do that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
hard to explain it's just up do that
sometimes<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.909> depends<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.900> day<00:01:19.080> i

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
sometimes it just depends on the day i

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
sometimes it just depends on the day i
guess<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> most<00:01:20.430> part<00:01:20.549> i<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.270> run

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
guess but for the most part i just run

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
guess but for the most part i just run
the<00:01:21.509> b<00:01:21.600> 23<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:24.049> FMJ<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.700> my

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the b 23 and FMJ and then going into my

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.160 
the b 23 and FMJ and then going into my
second<00:01:27.180> class<00:01:27.299> i<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.689> another<00:01:27.930> blister

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
second class i have another blister

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.330 
second class i have another blister
class<00:01:28.439> pretty<00:01:28.680> much<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> same<00:01:29.040> thing<00:01:29.100> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
class pretty much the same thing but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.770 
class pretty much the same thing but
like<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:29.729> said<00:01:29.759> i<00:01:29.939> use<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.540> ground

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
like i said i use this for like ground

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
like i said i use this for like ground
war<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.920> obviously<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.640> team<00:01:32.880> death<00:01:33.000> match

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030

if<00:01:33.420> they're<00:01:33.570> using<00:01:33.720> EMPs<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.619> c4's<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
if they're using EMPs or c4's this is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
if they're using EMPs or c4's this is
the<00:01:36.240> same<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.450> except<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.110> flak<00:01:37.409> jacket

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the same thing except it has flak jacket

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
the same thing except it has flak jacket
and<00:01:38.070> hardwired<00:01:38.610> instead<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> lightweight

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and hardwired instead of a lightweight

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
class and in one of my recent videos

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
class and in one of my recent videos
when<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:44.970> using<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.600> DSR<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> said

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
when I was just using the DSR I said

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
when I was just using the DSR I said
that<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> reload<00:01:47.939> cancel<00:01:48.420> um<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> know

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that when I reload cancel um I you know

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
that when I reload cancel um I you know
I<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.500> back<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> forth<00:01:49.890> between<00:01:50.189> fast<00:01:50.579> mags

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I go back and forth between fast mags

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
I go back and forth between fast mags
and<00:01:51.119> extended<00:01:51.600> mags<00:01:51.780> honestly<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> takes

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and extended mags honestly it takes

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
and extended mags honestly it takes
about<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> same<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.790> reload<00:01:54.030> cancel

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
about the same time to reload cancel

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
about the same time to reload cancel
it's<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.780> preference<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:56.369> just

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it's just preference really it's just

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
it's just preference really it's just
the<00:01:56.759> filled<00:01:56.939> again<00:01:57.149> because<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:58.020> goes

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the filled again because one goes

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
the filled again because one goes
further<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> reload<00:01:59.130> before<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.490> can

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
further into the reload before you can

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
further into the reload before you can
you<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.090> obviously<00:02:00.299> cancel<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you know obviously cancel it than the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.679 
you know obviously cancel it than the
other<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:03.000> lately<00:02:03.210> I've<00:02:03.390> been<00:02:03.450> used<00:02:03.600> an

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
other but lately I've been used an

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.030 
other but lately I've been used an
extended<00:02:04.079> clip<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.530> said<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.829> same

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
extended clip like I said it's the same

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.319 
extended clip like I said it's the same
untrusting<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.579> trying<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
untrusting I'm trying to use to it so I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
untrusting I'm trying to use to it so I
do<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.509> those<00:02:06.750> extra<00:02:06.869> bullets<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.560> besides

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
do have those extra bullets but besides

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.740 
do have those extra bullets but besides
that<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.610> basically<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> same<00:02:09.149> except<00:02:09.599> for

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that it's basically the same except for

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
that it's basically the same except for
attack<00:02:10.020> mastermind<00:02:10.560> dexterity<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
attack mastermind dexterity on this so I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.800 
attack mastermind dexterity on this so I
put<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:11.730> gun<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.060> faster<00:02:12.390> after<00:02:12.480> reload
