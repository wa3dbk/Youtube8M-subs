this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.410> why<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.280> opinion<00:01:02.310> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this is why in my opinion this is a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.569 
this is why in my opinion this is a
minion<00:01:03.750> killing<00:01:04.170> machine<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.400> long

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
minion killing machine because as long

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.609 
minion killing machine because as long
as<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> kill<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> 15<00:01:07.140> mo<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
as you get a kill with your 15 mo you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.520 
as you get a kill with your 15 mo you
can<00:01:07.829> just<00:01:08.040> keep<00:01:08.189> firing<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.150> fun

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
can just keep firing and it's really fun

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
can just keep firing and it's really fun
only<00:01:10.530> downside<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.400> clip<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.759> 15<00:01:12.180> mo

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
only downside is that a clip with 15 mo

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.719 
only downside is that a clip with 15 mo
in<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> pain<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.250> fighting

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
in it will be a pain when fighting

awesome as it is so don't hesitate to
pick<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.510> walking<00:01:27.750> through<00:01:28.020> an

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
pick it up I got this walking through an

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
pick it up I got this walking through an
exotic<00:01:28.530> bounty<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.100> everyone<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.940> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
exotic bounty and everyone i know that
