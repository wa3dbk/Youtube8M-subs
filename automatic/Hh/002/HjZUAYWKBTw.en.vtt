let's actually get the phone in show you
how<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.130> works<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.610> easy<00:01:23.880> install<00:01:24.299> just

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
how this works pretty easy install just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
how this works pretty easy install just
basically<00:01:24.780> inserted<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> center

basically inserted here into the center

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.420 
basically inserted here into the center
and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.479> basically<00:01:28.110> snap<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and then just basically snap on the the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
and then just basically snap on the the
exterior<00:01:29.909> shell<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.570> make<00:01:31.439> sure<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
exterior shell here make sure you get a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
exterior shell here make sure you get a
nice<00:01:32.040> solid<00:01:32.340> click<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> way<00:01:33.240> around<00:01:33.360> okay

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
band on you know just basically a band

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
band on you know just basically a band
style<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.299> outside<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.560> give

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
style on the outside and this will give

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.899 
style on the outside and this will give
it<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:40.979> bit<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> styling<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:41.759> also

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it a little bit of a styling but also

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
it a little bit of a styling but also
some<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.390> stuff<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.869> sort<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> grip<00:01:43.530> onto<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
some nice stuff to sort of grip onto and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.090 
some nice stuff to sort of grip onto and
then<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.119> basically<00:01:45.560> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
then just basically kind of get it and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.520 
then just basically kind of get it and
push<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.310> into<00:01:47.549> place<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.750> thing<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
push it into place now one thing just a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
push it into place now one thing just a
friend<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.189> little<00:01:50.399> hitch<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
friend here one little hitch on this is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
friend here one little hitch on this is
you<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.810> feels<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.229> little<00:01:52.380> loose<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you know this feels a little loose and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
you know this feels a little loose and
this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.159> probably<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.640> big<00:01:53.850> complaint<00:01:54.299> about

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this is probably one big complaint about

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
this is probably one big complaint about
it<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> loose

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it is it is a little bit of a loose

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
it is it is a little bit of a loose
design<00:01:56.880> once<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.020> on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
design once you get it on there it's on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.920 
design once you get it on there it's on
there<00:01:58.439> fine<00:01:58.920> it'll<00:01:59.399> stay<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.329> when

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
there fine it'll stay on there but when

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.359 
there fine it'll stay on there but when
I<00:02:00.990> take<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.740> pocket<00:02:02.219> or

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I take it in and on my pocket or

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.620 
I take it in and on my pocket or
sometimes<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> grab<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> little

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
sometimes if I kind of grab it a little

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
sometimes if I kind of grab it a little
weird<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.680> kind<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> falls<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
weird it kind of it kind of falls off a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.039 
weird it kind of it kind of falls off a
little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.210> alright<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.600> let's<00:02:06.750> start<00:02:06.899> down

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
little bit alright so let's start down

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
little bit alright so let's start down
here<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.469> bottom<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.489> 30<00:02:08.789> pin

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
here on the bottom you have a 30 pin

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
here on the bottom you have a 30 pin
cable<00:02:09.179> connector<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.259> then<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
cable connector right here and then the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.580 
cable connector right here and then the
main<00:02:10.649> microphone<00:02:10.860> speaker<00:02:11.310> port<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
main microphone speaker port this is

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.740 
main microphone speaker port this is
of<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.769> narrow<00:02:13.010> opening<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.599> some

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
of a narrow opening so if you have some

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.880 
of a narrow opening so if you have some
larger<00:02:15.080> connectors<00:02:15.410> might<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.739> some

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
larger connectors might have some

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
larger connectors might have some
problems<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.340> also<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:16.940> interesting

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
problems there also it's interesting

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.970 
problems there also it's interesting
there's<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.450> little<00:02:17.540> paper<00:02:17.810> film<00:02:18.290> kind<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> over

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
there's a little paper film kind of over

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.220 
there's a little paper film kind of over
each<00:02:19.700> port<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.390> that'll<00:02:20.629> protect<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:21.110> from

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
each port so that'll protect it from

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.780 
each port so that'll protect it from
getting<00:02:21.379> stuff<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.920> there<00:02:22.220> didn't<00:02:22.610> seem<00:02:22.700> to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
getting stuff in there didn't seem to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550 
getting stuff in there didn't seem to
affect<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.120> performance<00:02:23.300> at<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
affect the performance at all or on the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.410 
affect the performance at all or on the
side<00:02:24.739> volume<00:02:25.129> up<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.430> down<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.790> side<00:02:26.000> toggle

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
side volume up and down the side toggle

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.640 
side volume up and down the side toggle
switch<00:02:26.599> pretty<00:02:26.900> deep<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.260> we<00:02:27.319> have<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> dig

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
switch pretty deep so we have to dig

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.690 
switch pretty deep so we have to dig
your<00:02:27.769> nail<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.069> there<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> little<00:02:28.340> bit<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.580> get

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
your nail in there a little bit to get

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940 
your nail in there a little bit to get
at<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.420> top<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.290> headset<00:02:30.680> jack

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
at it up top here is that headset jack

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.530 
at it up top here is that headset jack
now<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.489> use<00:02:31.610> an<00:02:31.760> apples<00:02:32.090> headsets<00:02:32.420> you're

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
now if you use an apples headsets you're

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.270 
now if you use an apples headsets you're
not<00:02:32.629> going<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:32.930> any<00:02:33.140> problems<00:02:33.739> but<00:02:34.040> if

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
not going to have any problems but if

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
not going to have any problems but if
you<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.489> some<00:02:34.640> larger<00:02:35.000> headsets<00:02:35.420> most<00:02:36.049> of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
you have some larger headsets most of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.509 
you have some larger headsets most of
them<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.349> try<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.650> actually<00:02:36.950> didn't<00:02:37.190> fit<00:02:37.370> in

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
them I try it actually didn't fit in

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.100 
them I try it actually didn't fit in
there<00:02:37.700> which<00:02:37.849> is<00:02:37.970> why<00:02:38.120> they<00:02:38.750> include<00:02:39.019> this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
there which is why they include this

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.770 
there which is why they include this
little<00:02:39.379> audio<00:02:39.590> adapter<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.150> kind<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.420> pros<00:02:41.569> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
little audio adapter so kind of pros and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.150 
little audio adapter so kind of pros and
cons<00:02:41.930> here<00:02:42.170> eight<00:02:42.440> they<00:02:42.709> at<00:02:42.769> least<00:02:42.860> include

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
cons here eight they at least include

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.620 
cons here eight they at least include
the<00:02:43.340> adapter<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.090> works<00:02:44.299> pretty<00:02:44.480> well

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the adapter so that works pretty well

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.630 
the adapter so that works pretty well
for<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.709> have<00:02:45.829> had<00:02:45.980> cases<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.459> won't

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
for you you have had cases that won't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.120 
for you you have had cases that won't
even<00:02:46.819> fit<00:02:47.060> anything<00:02:47.329> other<00:02:47.840> than<00:02:48.019> apples<00:02:48.470> they

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
even fit anything other than apples they

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.380 
even fit anything other than apples they
don't<00:02:49.310> include<00:02:49.489> an<00:02:49.640> adapter<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.329> know

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
don't include an adapter but you know

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.729 
don't include an adapter but you know
the<00:02:50.480> bad<00:02:50.660> side<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.079> is<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.349> know<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.440> wouldn't

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the bad side is is you know I wouldn't

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.110 
the bad side is is you know I wouldn't
really<00:02:51.950> always<00:02:52.340> want<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.519> be<00:02:52.610> kinda<00:02:52.940> strong

really always want to be kinda strong

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.550 
really always want to be kinda strong

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
with me every time I want to go so a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440 
with me every time I want to go so a
little<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.950> bummer<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.519> whole<00:02:55.730> cutout

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
little of a bummer that the whole cutout

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.569 
little of a bummer that the whole cutout
is<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.870> small<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.590> also<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.860> pretty<00:02:58.250> deep

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
is so small and also a pretty deep

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.100 
is so small and also a pretty deep
you'll<00:02:58.910> recessed<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.390> there<00:02:59.540> pretty<00:02:59.660> good<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
you'll recessed in there pretty good and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.559 
you'll recessed in there pretty good and

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
here is the power button now on the back

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.150 
here is the power button now on the back
here<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:03.200> couple<00:03:03.470> things<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.769> note<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:04.129> the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
here a couple things to note is the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.729 
here a couple things to note is the
camera<00:03:04.730> with<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> flash<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.510> does<00:03:05.900> reflect<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
camera with a flash it does reflect the

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.530 
camera with a flash it does reflect the
the<00:03:07.190> light<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:08.030> bit<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.420> know<00:03:08.450> I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the light in a little bit you know I

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.240 
the light in a little bit you know I
guess<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.810> got<00:03:08.989> some<00:03:09.140> washing<00:03:09.590> out<00:03:09.739> on<00:03:10.040> this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
guess so I got some washing out on this

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.250 
guess so I got some washing out on this
this<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.000> white<00:03:11.209> case<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.780> usually<00:03:12.110> my

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
this is the white case and usually my

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.690 
this is the white case and usually my
trick<00:03:12.500> with<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.129> color<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.579> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
trick with this is all color in the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.880 
trick with this is all color in the
inside<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.239> sharpie<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:14.870> some<00:03:15.799> other

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
inside of the sharpie so some other

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.340 
inside of the sharpie so some other
color<00:03:16.220> cases<00:03:16.940> might<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.389> give<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.870> quite

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
color cases might not give that quite

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.900 
color cases might not give that quite
same<00:03:18.620> wash<00:03:18.829> out<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> likes<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.700> course

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
same wash out as the likes of course

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.789 
same wash out as the likes of course
white<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.299> highly<00:03:20.569> reflective<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.680> may

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
white is highly reflective and you may

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.009 
white is highly reflective and you may
be<00:03:21.829> able<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.340> color<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:23.060> with<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.359> sharpie

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
be able to a color in with a sharpie

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.930 
be able to a color in with a sharpie
marker<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:24.650> bit<00:03:24.769> with<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.430> I've

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
marker a little bit with that so I've

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.030 
marker a little bit with that so I've
just<00:03:26.000> note<00:03:26.359> that<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.840> then<00:03:27.019> also<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.859> is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
just note that and then also this is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.009 
just note that and then also this is
that<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.519> apple<00:03:29.120> logo<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.569> does<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
that the apple logo it does have the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.900 
that the apple logo it does have the
film<00:03:30.349> on<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.590> down<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.430> bottom<00:03:31.519> it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
film on it down here on the bottom it

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.120 
film on it down here on the bottom it
has<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.420> venting<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.620> phone<00:03:33.769> does<00:03:33.950> get

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
has a little venting the phone does get

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.620 
has a little venting the phone does get
a<00:03:34.160> little<00:03:34.310> warm<00:03:34.670> right<00:03:34.910> here<00:03:35.120> when<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.389> gets<00:03:35.510> in

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
a little warm right here when it gets in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.000 
a little warm right here when it gets in
you<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:35.930> i'm<00:03:35.989> guessing<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.470> venting<00:03:36.889> will

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
you so i'm guessing the venting will

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.680 
you so i'm guessing the venting will
help<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.280> some<00:03:37.489> heat<00:03:37.760> dissipation<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:38.630> so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
help with some heat dissipation just so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.110 
help with some heat dissipation just so
doesn't<00:03:38.959> lock<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.470> all<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.859> heat<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.340> also

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
doesn't lock in all that heat and also

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.089 
doesn't lock in all that heat and also
right<00:03:41.299> here<00:03:41.329> is<00:03:41.660> an<00:03:41.900> interesting<00:03:42.139> well<00:03:42.500> you
