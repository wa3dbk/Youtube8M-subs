00:00:46.550 --> 00:01:06.930 
unique shape to Atari 2600 cards let's
pop<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:47.000> in<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.239> old<00:00:47.449> 2600<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:48.530> give<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:48.949> a<00:00:49.010> try

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.820 

alright<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:08.150> must<00:01:08.360> confess<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:09.290> hadn't

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
alright I must confess that I hadn't

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.750 
alright I must confess that I hadn't
played<00:01:09.979> minor<00:01:10.549> 2049<00:01:11.360> or<00:01:11.540> ever<00:01:11.720> before<00:01:12.760> my

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
played minor 2049 or ever before my

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.940 
played minor 2049 or ever before my
recent<00:01:14.150> acquisition<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.960> I'd<00:01:15.799> never

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
recent acquisition of it I'd never

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.700 
recent acquisition of it I'd never
played<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.370> game<00:01:16.490> back<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.970> day<00:01:17.120> in<00:01:17.420> 82

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
played the game back in the day in 82

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.240 
played the game back in the day in 82
and<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:20.690> general<00:01:21.110> rule<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.290> thumb<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.830> don't

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and the general rule of thumb is I don't

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.609 
and the general rule of thumb is I don't
feel<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> need<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.150> read<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:24.049> instruction

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
feel the need to read the instruction

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.039 
feel the need to read the instruction
manuals<00:01:25.010> on<00:01:25.159> most<00:01:25.369> Atari<00:01:25.700> games<00:01:26.049> they're

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
manuals on most Atari games they're

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.899 
manuals on most Atari games they're
pretty<00:01:27.290> much<00:01:27.409> self-explanatory<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.760> then

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
pretty much self-explanatory and then

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.550 
pretty much self-explanatory and then
there's<00:01:29.060> only<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.240> joystick<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.080> button<00:01:30.409> or

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
there's only a joystick in one button or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.300 
there's only a joystick in one button or
a<00:01:30.619> paddle<00:01:31.250> controller<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.030> button<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
a paddle controller in one button and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.709 
a paddle controller in one button and
it's<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.369> pretty<00:01:34.520> easy<00:01:34.759> gameplay<00:01:35.299> for<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.539> most

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's a pretty easy gameplay for the most

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.660 
it's a pretty easy gameplay for the most
part<00:01:36.020> for<00:01:36.289> almost<00:01:36.710> every<00:01:37.130> Atari<00:01:37.670> 2600<00:01:38.210> game

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
part for almost every Atari 2600 game

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.370 
part for almost every Atari 2600 game
but<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.090> much<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.659> case<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:42.170> minor

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
but not so much with the case of minor

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.359 
but not so much with the case of minor
2049<00:01:43.189> err

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
2049 err

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.190 
2049 err
in<00:01:43.909> fact<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.210> popped<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:44.840> played<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.140> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
in fact I popped it in and played it a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.980 
in fact I popped it in and played it a
couple<00:01:45.409> times<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:46.070> was<00:01:46.909> baffled<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:47.719> couldn't

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
couple times and was baffled I couldn't

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.510 
couple times and was baffled I couldn't
figure<00:01:48.109> out<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.530> object<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.100> game<00:01:49.130> I

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
figure out the object of the game I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.370 
figure out the object of the game I
thought<00:01:50.119> at<00:01:50.270> first<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.630> was<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.869> collect<00:01:51.170> those

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
thought at first it was to collect those

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.700 
thought at first it was to collect those
little<00:01:51.710> items<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.170> would<00:01:54.259> advance<00:01:54.500> you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
little items and that would advance you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.340 
little items and that would advance you
to<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.920> next<00:01:55.159> stage<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.840> that's<00:01:57.079> not<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to the next stage but that's not the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.760 
to the next stage but that's not the
case

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
case

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.410 
case
collecting<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.340> items<00:01:58.609> only<00:01:58.789> allows<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.210> to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
collecting the items only allows you to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.130 
collecting the items only allows you to
kill<00:01:59.689> those<00:01:59.929> little<00:02:00.100> robot<00:02:01.100> looking<00:02:01.399> monsters

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
kill those little robot looking monsters

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.410 
kill those little robot looking monsters
not<00:02:03.140> even<00:02:03.499> sure<00:02:03.710> where<00:02:03.859> they<00:02:03.979> are<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:05.450> here

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
not even sure where they are like here

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.850 
not even sure where they are like here
so<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.539> first<00:02:08.750> couple<00:02:08.899> times<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.350> played<00:02:09.590> I

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so the first couple times I played I

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.830 
so the first couple times I played I
collected<00:02:10.399> all<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> items<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.540> nothing

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
collected all the items and and nothing

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.290 
collected all the items and and nothing
happened<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.950> timer<00:02:13.250> still<00:02:13.670> counted<00:02:14.120> down

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
happened the timer still counted down

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.420 
happened the timer still counted down
and<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.260> didn't<00:02:15.500> advance<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> next<00:02:16.100> stage

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and I didn't advance to the next stage

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.660 
and I didn't advance to the next stage
so<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.870> tried<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.290> again<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.890> time<00:02:18.950> tried

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so I tried it again and this time tried

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.600 
so I tried it again and this time tried
to<00:02:19.819> kill<00:02:20.060> all<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.450> monsters<00:02:21.310> still<00:02:22.310> no<00:02:22.430> dice

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
to kill all the monsters still no dice

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.720 
to kill all the monsters still no dice
still<00:02:23.270> didn't<00:02:23.480> advance<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.220> at<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.490> point

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
still didn't advance so at this point

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.580 
still didn't advance so at this point
I'm<00:02:25.910> thinking<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.240> myself<00:02:26.360> what<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.350> is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I'm thinking to myself what the is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'm thinking to myself what the is
the<00:02:27.710> point<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.190> game<00:02:28.280> what's<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.030> goal

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
the point of this game what's the goal

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.460 
the point of this game what's the goal
here<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.010> couldn't<00:02:31.190> figure<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.490> out<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.440> I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
here and I couldn't figure it out so I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.770 
here and I couldn't figure it out so I
looked<00:02:33.740> online<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.490> manual<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.569> read

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
looked online for a manual and I read

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.530 
looked online for a manual and I read
the<00:02:35.870> instruction<00:02:36.319> manual<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:38.090> didn't

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the instruction manual and that didn't

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.210 
the instruction manual and that didn't
help<00:02:38.690> either<00:02:39.879> so

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
help either so

00:02:41.220 --> 00:03:19.360 
help either so
I<00:02:41.310> moved<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> step<00:02:42.990> two

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.900 

oh<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.780> get<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.440> apparently<00:03:22.099> you<00:03:22.730> have

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
oh so now I get it apparently you have

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.440 
oh so now I get it apparently you have
to<00:03:23.150> walk<00:03:23.870> across<00:03:24.290> every<00:03:24.890> single<00:03:25.099> platform<00:03:25.459> for

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
to walk across every single platform for

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.410 
to walk across every single platform for
the<00:03:26.540> game<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.319> cover<00:03:28.010> every<00:03:28.670> square<00:03:29.090> inch<00:03:29.300> of

the game and cover every square inch of
it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.140 
it
now<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.920> didn't<00:03:31.220> notice<00:03:31.430> before<00:03:31.459> when<00:03:31.849> I<00:03:31.940> first

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
now I didn't notice before when I first

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.170 
now I didn't notice before when I first
started<00:03:32.450> playing<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:34.069> area<00:03:34.940> where<00:03:35.090> you

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
started playing that the area where you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.990 
started playing that the area where you
walk<00:03:35.769> changes<00:03:36.769> from<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:37.099> checkered<00:03:37.519> pattern<00:03:37.700> to

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
walk changes from a checkered pattern to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.630 
walk changes from a checkered pattern to
a<00:03:38.030> solid<00:03:38.540> color<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:39.860> indicate<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.430> progress

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
a solid color to indicate the progress

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.320 
a solid color to indicate the progress
you've<00:03:41.000> made<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:42.670> from<00:03:43.670> what<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.819> understand

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
you've made and from what I understand

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.470 
you've made and from what I understand
have<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.690> cover<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.560> entire<00:03:45.980> area<00:03:46.420> all<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
have to cover the entire area all the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.089 
have to cover the entire area all the
platforms<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.989> game<00:03:51.260> got<00:03:51.560> very

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
platforms now this game got very

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.910 
platforms now this game got very
frustrated<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:52.880> quickly<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.709> few

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
frustrated very quickly for a few

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.160 
frustrated very quickly for a few
different<00:03:55.010> reasons<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:56.209> there<00:03:56.750> was<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> lot<00:03:57.049> of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
different reasons a there was a lot of

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.830 
different reasons a there was a lot of
redundancy<00:03:57.260> in<00:03:58.069> this<00:03:58.610> task<00:03:59.209> alone<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.720> whole

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
redundancy in this task alone the whole

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.120 
redundancy in this task alone the whole
the<00:04:00.079> whole<00:04:00.110> concept<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.739> gameplay<00:04:01.040> is

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
the whole concept of the gameplay is

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.750 
the whole concept of the gameplay is
just<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.489> an<00:04:02.060> exercise<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.260> time<00:04:04.040> wasting

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
just a an exercise in time wasting

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.509 
just a an exercise in time wasting
I<00:04:04.790> felt<00:04:05.890> wasn't<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:07.099> that<00:04:07.280> exciting<00:04:07.879> and

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
I felt wasn't all that exciting and

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.210 
I felt wasn't all that exciting and
second<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.819> my<00:04:11.120> biggest<00:04:11.360> complaint<00:04:11.980> more<00:04:12.980> so

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
second and my biggest complaint more so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.900 
second and my biggest complaint more so
than<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.200> mediocre<00:04:15.200> gameplay<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.669> fact

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
than the mediocre gameplay is the fact

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.390 
than the mediocre gameplay is the fact
that<00:04:17.000> when<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.269> die<00:04:17.510> it<00:04:18.470> resets<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.100> entire

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
that when you die it resets the entire

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.949 
that when you die it resets the entire
stage<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.419> have<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.600> do<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:20.930> over

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
stage and you have to do it all over

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.700 
stage and you have to do it all over
again<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:23.090> it's<00:04:23.180> basically<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.720> game<00:04:23.990> where<00:04:24.560> you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
again so it's basically a game where you

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.469 
again so it's basically a game where you
have<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:25.510> walk<00:04:26.510> every<00:04:27.410> square<00:04:27.680> inch--<00:04:28.479> period

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
have to walk every square inch-- period

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.200 
have to walk every square inch-- period
and<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.860> that's<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.340> not<00:04:31.430> much<00:04:31.610> fun<00:04:31.850> at

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
and and that's just not much fun at

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.159 
and and that's just not much fun at
least<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:32.510> my<00:04:32.630> opinion<00:04:34.570> now<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.660> know<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:35.990> game

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
least in my opinion now I know this game

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.969 
least in my opinion now I know this game
is<00:04:36.289> an<00:04:36.410> early<00:04:36.680> platformer<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:39.050> know<00:04:39.229> it

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
is an early platformer and you know it

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.040 
is an early platformer and you know it
was<00:04:40.160> basically<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.669> new<00:04:40.880> genre

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
was basically a new genre

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.779 
was basically a new genre
it<00:04:42.470> was<00:04:42.650> interesting<00:04:43.280> in<00:04:44.090> 82<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:46.460> far<00:04:46.669> as

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
it was interesting in 82 as far as

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.629 
it was interesting in 82 as far as
gameplay<00:04:47.180> concepts<00:04:47.690> are<00:04:47.840> concerned<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:49.099> not

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
gameplay concepts are concerned but not

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.570 
gameplay concepts are concerned but not
so<00:04:49.849> much<00:04:50.000> today<00:04:50.440> there<00:04:51.440> are<00:04:51.710> much<00:04:52.010> better

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
so much today there are much better

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.029 
so much today there are much better
earlier<00:04:53.150> platforms<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.780> play<00:04:53.960> than<00:04:54.229> -<00:04:54.500> 2040

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
earlier platforms to play than - 2040

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.159 
earlier platforms to play than - 2040
Winer<00:04:55.220> in<00:04:55.460> my<00:04:55.610> opinion<00:04:56.000> one<00:04:56.900> of<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.020> best

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
Winer in my opinion one of the best

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.839 
Winer in my opinion one of the best
being<00:04:57.470> Donkey<00:04:57.919> Kong<00:05:00.340> but<00:05:01.340> there<00:05:01.490> were<00:05:01.610> other

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
being Donkey Kong but there were other

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.879 
being Donkey Kong but there were other
cool<00:05:02.150> games<00:05:02.389> like<00:05:02.780> lode<00:05:03.080> runner<00:05:03.260> which<00:05:03.710> was

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
cool games like lode runner which was

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.350 
cool games like lode runner which was
also<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.250> pretty<00:05:04.520> neat<00:05:04.729> early<00:05:05.360> entry<00:05:05.810> into<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
also a pretty neat early entry into the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.890 
also a pretty neat early entry into the
platforming<00:05:08.360> genre<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.270> was<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.450> big<00:05:11.660> fan<00:05:11.870> of

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
platforming genre and I was a big fan of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.490 
platforming genre and I was a big fan of
lode<00:05:12.139> runner<00:05:12.289> when<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.650> was<00:05:12.770> out

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
lode runner when it was out

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.310 
lode runner when it was out
but<00:05:15.500> alas<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:16.490> game<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:17.000> no<00:05:17.180> load<00:05:17.750> runner<00:05:18.020> or

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
but alas this game is no load runner or

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.029 
but alas this game is no load runner or
Donkey<00:05:18.860> Kong<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:20.450> find<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:21.169> instead<00:05:21.979> of

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
Donkey Kong and I find the instead of

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:22.850 
Donkey Kong and I find the instead of
the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.719 
the
gameplay<00:05:23.669> quite<00:05:24.569> annoying<00:05:25.520> coupled<00:05:26.520> with<00:05:26.550> the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
gameplay quite annoying coupled with the

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.850 
gameplay quite annoying coupled with the
fact<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.509> know<00:05:27.690> every<00:05:28.470> time<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.710> die

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
fact that you know every time you die

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.950 
fact that you know every time you die
you<00:05:28.889> reset<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.669> whole<00:05:29.789> stage<00:05:30.060> which<00:05:30.810> is

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
you reset the whole stage which is

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.300 
you reset the whole stage which is
definitely<00:05:31.139> not<00:05:31.500> fun<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:33.300> this<00:05:33.690> game<00:05:33.900> is<00:05:34.379> not

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
definitely not fun so this game is not

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.899 
definitely not fun so this game is not
that<00:05:35.370> great<00:05:35.849> in<00:05:36.030> my<00:05:36.150> book<00:05:37.430> now<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> never<00:05:38.669> did

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
that great in my book now I never did

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.520 
that great in my book now I never did
get<00:05:39.000> past<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.389> first<00:05:39.629> stage<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:40.139> this<00:05:40.259> game

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
get past the first stage in this game

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.820 
get past the first stage in this game
and<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.830> wasn't<00:05:41.190> for<00:05:41.490> lack<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.360> trying<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:43.199> I

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
and it wasn't for lack of trying and I

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.040 
and it wasn't for lack of trying and I
really<00:05:44.190> thought<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.400> had<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.669> here<00:05:45.060> just<00:05:45.810> one

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
really thought I had it here just one

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.860

level I mean look I'm practically there

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.309
