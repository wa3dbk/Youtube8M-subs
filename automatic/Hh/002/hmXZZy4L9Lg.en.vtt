the Walt logo and it asks you to pre map
your<00:01:03.170> your<00:01:03.469> area<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.010> want<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.280> scan<00:01:04.549> put

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
your your area that you want to scan put

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.539 
your your area that you want to scan put
it<00:01:05.570> against<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.930> wall<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:09.350> pre<00:01:09.650> map<00:01:09.890> or<00:01:10.159> pre

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
it against the wall you pre map or pre

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.450 
it against the wall you pre map or pre
scan<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:11.990> once<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.770> pre<00:01:13.040> scan<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
scan and then once you you pre scan the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.999 
scan and then once you you pre scan the
data<00:01:13.750> as<00:01:14.750> soon<00:01:14.960> as<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.200> start<00:01:15.470> back<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.860> other

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
data as soon as you start back the other

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.430 
data as soon as you start back the other
direction<00:01:16.450> it'll<00:01:17.450> show<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.720> exactly<00:01:17.840> what's

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
direction it'll show you exactly what's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.649 
direction it'll show you exactly what's
in<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.710> wall<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.610> there<00:01:19.850> it's<00:01:20.149> showing<00:01:20.540> us

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659
