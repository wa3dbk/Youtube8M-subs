00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.300
 hello very good 33 we are in this new 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.969
 video in which I will explain the 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.669
 solution to the problem that you 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:16.209
 your play 3 has no ip address 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.400
 when you are connected by cable 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.640
 or by wifi the problem in principle 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.230
 you do not have to give any problem 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.939
 for not finding the ip address if 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.800
 you have to find it worth it but at 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.599
 better by cables for some problem of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.269
 that the solutions can not find 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.880
 you have internet connection settings 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.950
 why 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.530
 be invited to play I will accept that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.900
 you have to give it personalized 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 You have to do what I 'm doing 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.850
 right now that is, you have to move more 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.510
 things by automatic detection cable 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 all automatic and in automatic we follow 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.350
 we continue not to use and in pnp deactivate 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.109
 it's ok to deactivate 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 now do not try connection you give back 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.920
 It is worth what you should do to pay for your 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.680
 play 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.619
 the pay is here or as you want or from 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.930
 here listen lots of media the system 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.330
 you must turn off the play 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.240
 once you have turned off your play 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.800
 you have to turn off the router during 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.840
 I recommend what I have done two 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.720
 minutes minute and a half two minutes what 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.940
 you turn off the router 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.290
 you leave four minutes or three until 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.480
 Fully grasp and have interest 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.610
 then turn on the lights play and 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.070
 you will have another internal already 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 Once this problem is valid, it is due to a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.590
 problem with the router is worth what 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 better all change the cable the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.570
 computer and the bet to the play because no 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.310
 get a new ip address 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.020
 for the play with which you must restart 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.850
 the router that I tell you the steps is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.400
 do what I have taught you here in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.030
 the video to see how they have worked 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.119
 session started account is worth there you see 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.350
 well then I repeat the steps is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.290
 First do the steps you said 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.850
 that second turn off the play and third 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.260
 restart the root it is good to turn off the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.979
 router for one minute a minute and 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.080
 half 2 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.220
 then re-start the router let 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.159
 that completely loads the router 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.569
 wait two minutes turn on to play and 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.390
 you will have internet again 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.730
 completely good there I leave you the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.769
 solution I've been looking for you have 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
