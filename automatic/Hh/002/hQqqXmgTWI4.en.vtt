00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.720 

okay<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.019> let's<00:03:40.319> turn<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.680> disorder<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:43.730> want

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
okay so let's turn the disorder on want

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.729 
okay so let's turn the disorder on want
to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.030> sweep<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.329> whole<00:03:47.540> John<00:03:48.540> no<00:03:49.230> pushing

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
to do it sweep the whole John no pushing

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.949 
to do it sweep the whole John no pushing
their<00:03:49.829> own<00:03:49.919> direction<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.540> guess<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
their own direction and I guess so the

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:01.849 
their own direction and I guess so the
the<00:03:52.410> characters<00:03:53.069> light<00:03:53.280> up<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.750> we<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:01.109> you

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
the characters light up so we have you

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.080 
the characters light up so we have you
know<00:04:01.889> different<00:04:02.160> sounds<00:04:02.609> when<00:04:02.669> I<00:04:02.760> pulled<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
know different sounds when I pulled the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.680 
know different sounds when I pulled the
trigger

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:26.920 

and<00:04:08.830> now<00:04:09.830> as<00:04:10.340> if<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:10.670> push<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.760> those<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.780> three
