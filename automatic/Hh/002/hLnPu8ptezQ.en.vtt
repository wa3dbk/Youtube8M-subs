00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.940
 and my people 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.940
 Yes, I took longer to record. 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.810
 prevented from using your computer for reason 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.660
 of force majeure is that you understand me 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.900
 Let's start this chapter now. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.480
 have a spoiler in the video title then 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.100
 Yes it is 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.270
 according to my mantra is the 11th in bed already 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.090
 was defined 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.010
 eleventh because the tenth and already 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.280
 be the dindim a lot of people are talking 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.960
 that what is good the young man that will enter the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.090
 gang 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.930
 Actually, I do not have one. 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.900
 counter-argument in relation to this but 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.420
 I have arguments 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.450
 I think they are reasonable for the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:05.229
 money and band 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:08.360
 now I think I will not get it 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.060
 basically because type that mounts behind 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.729
 his son and there after he 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.650
 rescuing his son will leave his son 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.070
 he will follow with the bank then vice 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.359
 versa will leave the son of band and will 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.119
 though 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:29.710
 It might happen but we'll see more. 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:35.079
 I will now show you the factors that I 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.289
 I found that they will show you that 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:44.030
 It looks like it's going to be the woman. 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.920
 now the first is that it is not anymore 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.929
 may she be evil 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.409
 even if she is fighting a 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.710
 not necessarily because of 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.389
 she will not enter because 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 happened to Robinho too 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.090
 she was together with daniela just go 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.700
 then it went into human anyway 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.939
 so it interferes a lot is another thing 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.819
 thing is also that she is a hoot she is 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.569
 user already with the type name praises the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.880
 guide listen and this in the pack would be very 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.850
 interesting because it already has user to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.959
 mercia end zone then an ideology 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.110
 it would be very interesting to use 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.840
 depending on the occasion 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.910
 because far is itself is the three is the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.480
 rarer and more powerful 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
 taking its mystique something else too 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.300
 that flies 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.990
 this would be very very very very useful 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.790
 because he with the entrance of the dingue he 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.200
 already have a person who specializes in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.590
 being under the water 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:02.340
 her own and she would be the one she flies 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.489
 would be useful on occasions when someone who 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:21.239
 blow away the blood 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:25.230
 walker that is underwater and her other 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:29.430
 something that is not necessarily 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.390
 important but that it would be good to 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:39.269
 She has very little woman in the woman. 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:44.130
 It would be very cool if you had 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:51.739
 one more woman on the bench and one 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:53.430
 important to define the entry of 1 more 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.290
 it would be good 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:04.680
 now the most important point as far as 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.140
 important that's what I'm talking about 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.620
 who does not know the pinnacle of a world of 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.640
 pool in six fights around him 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.140
 And if you stop to think what? 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.320
 there would be 16 light 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.609
 logically they would be nothing i do not know 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.919
 not only of embellishment 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.220
 each of them will have its importance 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.620
 How did one go where it went? 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.770
 already has an importance and one of them 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:38.849
 another was involving the capone bank 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:42.659
 that will remind 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:46.349
 that is, the streets are beginning to 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:50.849
 participate in the story and this does not 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:54.899
 and the rest in them and they will all have a 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.849
 important role or what I think 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:05:01.649
 on here 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:04.469
 the pack probably will surely 

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:07.199
 to one of these streets 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:09.959
 Why did not he already go under 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.139
 Water has already been beach in the clouds of the sky 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:17.699
 above nucel skype 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:22.589
 who guarantees that he will not go to the street and 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:25.709
 there for the moon or no more type for sure 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.539
 will have something related to the moon to 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:30.179
 some of the moons 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.969
 they will need what a 

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:36.769
 specialist who understands this gives 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.849
 an astronomical gastronomy or some 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:43.800
 thing like that 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:47.610
 who has to step on and guess what the 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.559
 money and she understands it will in 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.860
 description that has an image that will 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.459
 go 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.129
 You know there will open and look at the image. 

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:02.930
 will be written in the astro book of 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.930
 head down do not look so obvious right? 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.360
 that is, she has an astrology book 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.990
 something astronomy found so 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.300
 something and it shows that she 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.619
 study has a knowledge about this 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.879
 study about it 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:23.279
 so this is a key point is a detail 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.649
 so you see that only that word he 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.469
 is looking like one of the others is not 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:31.259
 appearing and that word was dropped 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:33.089
 upside down not to be as or more 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.149
 is a very important detail that I 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.039
 I found and there they demanded how they 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:41.309
 would go to the moon 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:43.619
 I do not know why to go to the island of 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:47.579
 Thirty they were a coated ship 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:50.670
 with a bubble of air to go to skype 

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:53.760
 they got that one in cap 100 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.200
 what was one had a surge of waters 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.070
 in what did 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.680
 It is what I had or disappear, I do not know. 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.940
 that there is someone else in the cap who 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.180
 leads to the moon 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.500
 I do not know probably not but it can be 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.830
 Yes, that may not be 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:14.640
 but somehow they will go there 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.180
 for this they needed danone because 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.720
 she understands that now another point 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:27.960
 important but it's one but it's one thing 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:31.440
 so a richer rule exists 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:35.030
 a silly rule but that is present and 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.730
 which can not be ignored 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:43.200
 have already realized that all members of the 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:45.030
 each one of them each each name 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.620
