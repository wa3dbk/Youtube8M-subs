00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.890 

there<00:00:07.189> are<00:00:07.310> two<00:00:07.430> primary<00:00:07.910> methods<00:00:08.090> for<00:00:08.570> adding

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
there are two primary methods for adding

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.170 
there are two primary methods for adding
or<00:00:09.049> subtracting<00:00:09.080> mixed<00:00:09.799> numbers<00:00:10.090> and<00:00:11.090> I'll

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
or subtracting mixed numbers and I'll

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.430 
or subtracting mixed numbers and I'll
demonstrate<00:00:11.330> both<00:00:11.990> in

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
demonstrate both in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.949 
demonstrate both in
each<00:00:12.500> of<00:00:12.589> these<00:00:12.709> examples<00:00:12.889> here<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:14.719> first

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
each of these examples here the first

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.950 
each of these examples here the first
method<00:00:15.379> is<00:00:15.520> to<00:00:16.520> convert<00:00:16.820> both<00:00:17.119> terms<00:00:17.509> to<00:00:17.840> an

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
method is to convert both terms to an

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.069 
method is to convert both terms to an
improper<00:00:18.259> fraction<00:00:18.410> before<00:00:19.250> adding<00:00:19.930> so<00:00:20.930> we'll

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.079 
improper fraction before adding so we'll

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:27.609 
improper fraction before adding so we'll
take<00:00:21.320> 3<00:00:21.800> times<00:00:22.099> 2<00:00:22.430> 6<00:00:23.060> plus<00:00:23.840> 2<00:00:24.169> is<00:00:24.380> 8<00:00:24.699> over<00:00:25.699> 3<00:00:26.619> plus

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
take 3 times 2 6 plus 2 is 8 over 3 plus

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.030 
take 3 times 2 6 plus 2 is 8 over 3 plus
3<00:00:28.579> times<00:00:29.029> 3<00:00:29.419> is<00:00:29.450> 9<00:00:29.599> plus<00:00:30.110> 2<00:00:30.950> is<00:00:30.980> 11<00:00:31.719> over<00:00:32.719> 3<00:00:33.040> we'll

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
3 times 3 is 9 plus 2 is 11 over 3 we'll

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.529 
3 times 3 is 9 plus 2 is 11 over 3 we'll
add<00:00:34.190> these<00:00:34.370> together<00:00:34.780> 8<00:00:35.780> plus<00:00:36.320> 11<00:00:36.710> is<00:00:36.829> 19<00:00:37.670> over

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
add these together 8 plus 11 is 19 over

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.130 
add these together 8 plus 11 is 19 over
3<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.170> 3<00:00:40.129> goes<00:00:40.280> into<00:00:40.460> 19<00:00:40.969> 6<00:00:41.390> times<00:00:41.690> with<00:00:42.110> a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
3 and 3 goes into 19 6 times with a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.279 
3 and 3 goes into 19 6 times with a
remainder<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.620> 1<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.100> our<00:00:43.760> solution<00:00:44.329> is<00:00:44.480> 6<00:00:44.960> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
remainder of 1 so our solution is 6 and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.119 
remainder of 1 so our solution is 6 and
1/3<00:00:46.300> now<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.359> second<00:00:47.809> method<00:00:47.899> is<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.829> add<00:00:48.949> the

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
1/3 now the second method is to add the

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.579 
1/3 now the second method is to add the
whole<00:00:49.339> number<00:00:49.640> parts<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.899> fraction<00:00:51.350> part

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
whole number parts and the fraction part

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.729 
whole number parts and the fraction part
separately<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:53.690> 2<00:00:54.109> plus<00:00:54.469> 3<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:54.980> 5<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:56.409> 2/3<00:00:57.409> plus

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
separately so 2 plus 3 is 5 and 2/3 plus

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.489 
separately so 2 plus 3 is 5 and 2/3 plus
2/3<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.719> 4/3<00:01:01.839> unfortunately<00:01:02.839> this<00:01:03.019> is<00:01:03.289> not<00:01:03.319> a

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
2/3 is 4/3 unfortunately this is not a

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.439 
2/3 is 4/3 unfortunately this is not a
proper<00:01:03.889> mixed<00:01:04.159> number<00:01:04.460> because<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
proper mixed number because the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.230 
proper mixed number because the
fractional<00:01:05.930> part<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.320> greater<00:01:06.560> than<00:01:06.710> 1<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
fractional part is greater than 1 so

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.539 
fractional part is greater than 1 so
we'll<00:01:08.240> have<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.540> convert<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.110> fraction<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.520> a

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
we'll have to convert this fraction to a

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.620 
we'll have to convert this fraction to a
mixed<00:01:10.610> number<00:01:11.049> 1<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.500> 1/3<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.460> then<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:14.479> can

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
mixed number 1 and 1/3 and then we can

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.470 
mixed number 1 and 1/3 and then we can
add<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.990> 5<00:01:15.200> back<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:16.580> get<00:01:16.820> 6<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.080> 1/3

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
add the 5 back in and we get 6 and 1/3

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.040 
add the 5 back in and we get 6 and 1/3
now<00:01:20.480> in<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.720> second<00:01:21.050> problem<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:22.430> have<00:01:22.930> 4<00:01:23.930> and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
now in the second problem we have 4 and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.550 
now in the second problem we have 4 and
1/6<00:01:24.620> minus<00:01:24.740> 2<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.400> 5<00:01:25.580> 6<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.780> first<00:01:27.110> we're<00:01:27.440> going

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
1/6 minus 2 and 5 6 so first we're going

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.190 
1/6 minus 2 and 5 6 so first we're going
to<00:01:27.620> do<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.070> improper<00:01:28.490> fraction<00:01:28.970> method<00:01:29.300> 6

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
to do the improper fraction method 6

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.060 
to do the improper fraction method 6
times<00:01:30.470> 4<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:30.830> 24<00:01:31.280> plus<00:01:32.090> 1<00:01:32.270> is<00:01:32.660> 25<00:01:33.760> over<00:01:34.760> 6<00:01:35.060> minus

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
times 4 is 24 plus 1 is 25 over 6 minus

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.220 
times 4 is 24 plus 1 is 25 over 6 minus
6<00:01:37.070> times<00:01:37.310> 2<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.610> 12<00:01:37.880> plus<00:01:38.450> 5<00:01:39.110> 17<00:01:40.600> also<00:01:41.600> over<00:01:41.960> 6

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
6 times 2 is 12 plus 5 17 also over 6

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.530 
6 times 2 is 12 plus 5 17 also over 6
and<00:01:42.850> we'll<00:01:43.850> subtract<00:01:44.330> 25<00:01:44.930> minus<00:01:45.410> 17<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.430> 8<00:01:46.790> over

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
and we'll subtract 25 minus 17 is 8 over

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
and we'll subtract 25 minus 17 is 8 over
6<00:01:47.960> or<00:01:48.760> 4<00:01:49.760> over<00:01:50.060> 3<00:01:50.360> which<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.500> equal<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.800> 1<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
6 or 4 over 3 which is equal to 1 and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.600 
6 or 4 over 3 which is equal to 1 and
1/3

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
1/3

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.870 
1/3
the<00:01:55.610> second<00:01:56.060> method<00:01:56.260> has<00:01:57.610> subtracting<00:01:58.610> 2<00:01:58.850> from

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
the second method has subtracting 2 from

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.180 
the second method has subtracting 2 from
4<00:01:59.420> to<00:02:00.050> get<00:02:00.170> 2<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:01.150> subtracting<00:02:02.150> 5/6<00:02:03.020> from<00:02:03.440> 1/6

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
4 to get 2 and subtracting 5/6 from 1/6

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.919 
4 to get 2 and subtracting 5/6 from 1/6
to<00:02:04.520> get<00:02:04.730> negative<00:02:05.570> 4<00:02:06.500> or<00:02:06.890> 6<00:02:07.479> now<00:02:08.479> obviously

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
to get negative 4 or 6 now obviously

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.449 
to get negative 4 or 6 now obviously
this<00:02:09.110> doesn't<00:02:09.470> work<00:02:09.649> because<00:02:10.099> we<00:02:10.310> have<00:02:10.429> a

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
this doesn't work because we have a

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.309 
this doesn't work because we have a
positive<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.330> negative<00:02:11.360> part<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.200> this

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
positive and a negative part to this

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.890 
positive and a negative part to this
number<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.459> what<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.870> can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
number so what we have to do is we can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.490 
number so what we have to do is we can
convert<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:15.530> whole<00:02:15.769> number<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.730> 1<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.420> 6<00:02:18.200> or

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
convert this whole number to 1 and 6 or

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.910 
convert this whole number to 1 and 6 or
6<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.510> subtract<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.230> 4<00:02:21.440> over<00:02:21.620> 6

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
6 and then we can subtract the 4 over 6

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
6 and then we can subtract the 4 over 6
to<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:23.000> 1<00:02:23.600> and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
to get 1 and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:37.080 
to get 1 and
to<00:02:25.000> over<00:02:25.360> 6<00:02:25.690> or<00:02:26.350> 1<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.730> 1/3

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150
