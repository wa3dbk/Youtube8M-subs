00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.309
 so hello people i want you today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.190
 nice little gadget show me what i am 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 ordered from Amazon and for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 That's about 750, and that's it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 this little radio controlled car that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 comes in a box that gives 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 it in different colors and with 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.820
 different frequencies should be on it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 You pay attention when you are for example 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 23 cars would like to let go 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.800
 each must have its own frequency 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.500
 have the frequency one sees here for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.360
 example here the 35 megahertz that is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 every car should be different 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.050
 frequency have to be there just not in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 to get the cross 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:01:00.469
 that's the whole thing I pack the x 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.030
 Let's get out of here, here are two 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.449
 You can also get pins 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 put 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.590
 I slalom driving you'm out of here the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590
 Press the lever 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:41.560
 So also once the car looks like this 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:46.050
 the whole thing that he has beautiful rubber wheels 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.050
 for a good adhesion 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.369
 It is also the best way, too 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.009
 to drive on such a smooth floor and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.240
 less on a carpet because at the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:09.250
 carpet fibers in the wheels after a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:13.450
 time can prevent down here 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.760
 to set a separation that is 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.140
 if the car, for example, slightly behind 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.650
 you can see that on the left or right 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:26.980
 here with this little lever 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 Correct so that's the car this one 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:38.070
 is the remote control can be from 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.070
 itself like that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.500
 Batteries are not included 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.840
 here you can turn on the car then 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 I'll do a trial ride right now 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.640
 and when batteries do it clean
