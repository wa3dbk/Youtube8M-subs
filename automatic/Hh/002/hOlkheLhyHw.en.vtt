you're<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.390> run<00:01:45.509> across<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.840> sign<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you're going to run across a sign that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.930 
you're going to run across a sign that
tells<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> can't<00:01:46.950> hike<00:01:47.159> uphill<00:01:47.399> because

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
tells you you can't hike uphill because

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.520 
tells you you can't hike uphill because

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
maybe we're still working in palisades

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
maybe we're still working in palisades
and<00:01:49.830> then<00:01:50.759> eventually<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.170> to
