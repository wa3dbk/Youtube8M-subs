00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.020
 today just before it wants to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 I seed for harvesting a very beautiful 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.210
 orange dressing table 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.920
 and here is the withered day 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.469
 flower center dropped 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.859
 the petals a few weeks ago 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.020
 and now the seed rides the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.600
 seed pods cider completely cool out and in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.600
 that room boxes see the hoarfrost and seeds 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.210
 mel here I am with the seedless 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.740
 seed pods of the poppy and of many 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 other plants must be kept straight 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.190
 because otherwise it would mature seed in it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.780
 fall out 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 are actually wind uprights that come with the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.370
 winter go much more then you would 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 plants itself in this way from reint 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.110
 now for a moment 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.110
 you will see that static dust fine 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.789
 sees it and there is a lot in it and there 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.109
 are perhaps still easily 100 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.820
 200 seeds in a seed or so and now the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.240
 others so if all those seeds germinate seeds 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 then the whole garden full of style would have a lot of seed 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 you do not need and the pleasant thing is that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.900
 you of course easily gift as well 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.270
 can give to people who are not beautiful 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.240
 orange pavert you don't have in the garden 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 garden friend or a train invention to good 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 be and must state a little 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 after drying I did that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.369
 with seed that I harvested last week 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.270
 I put that in on a dry 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.549
 place 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.829
 now it is sufficiently dry and I have too 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 dried a petal and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.829
 petal of the patertje I have one 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.670
 name written down 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 and now I only need plastic 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.430
 bag or just in an envelope and it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.590
 spreading seed which is not yet the case 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.710
 goes easy 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.140
 all succeeds well master is in that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.649
 the looks in between are always still there 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.320
 a bit of dust that is not bad 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.550
 look if you have that leaf on a beautiful one 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.550
 place is a bit higher or example 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.790
 in the package there you actually have one 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.890
 beautiful gift to find a garden 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.790
 percent to a friend 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.980
 you can't do that alone with her 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.810
 poppy seed no you can do that with mass 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.120
 you can with the seeds of the ark 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.050
 you can get with seed from thorsen and then hoof 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.690
 you again like that 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.940
 flower of a dordts to dry or a 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.140
 flower of a single he then hammer on 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.350
 to write 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.180
 and so you have a present 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.950
 sometimes you need another seed a little 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.470
 allow to dry 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 the old system on which to bring them to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.550
 onions and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.720
 Garlic oil that is dry 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.570
 hanging upside down to seed from this plant 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.770
 completely black and then you can do it 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.590
 easily release again 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.780
 you already start it and you are ripe again 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.100
 seed that you can do next year 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.200
 to sow 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.200
