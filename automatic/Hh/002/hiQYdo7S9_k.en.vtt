00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
as far as like animal

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.959 
as far as like animal
emgo's<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.829> this<00:02:06.490> seems<00:02:06.670> kind<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
emgo's and so this seems kind of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.490 
emgo's and so this seems kind of
interesting<00:02:07.450> i've<00:02:07.570> been<00:02:07.719> hearing<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.110> lot<00:02:08.140> i'm

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
not really a lot about it but like you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
know I went to be a and saw him speak a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.000 
know I went to be a and saw him speak a
little<00:02:13.300> bit<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.690> t<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.019> Arthur<00:02:14.200> caramel<00:02:14.800> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
little bit at t know Arthur caramel and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.350 
little bit at t know Arthur caramel and
it<00:02:15.099> sounded<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:15.489> he<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:15.819> very<00:02:16.030> passionate

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
it sounded like he was very passionate

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.570 
it sounded like he was very passionate
about<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:17.050> book<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.950> I'm<00:02:18.069> thinking<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
about this book and so I'm thinking that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.949 
about this book and so I'm thinking that
this<00:02:18.700> would<00:02:18.880> be<00:02:18.970> very<00:02:19.120> interesting<00:02:19.780> because

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
this would be very interesting because

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.559 
this would be very interesting because
it<00:02:20.530> doesn't<00:02:21.130> take<00:02:21.280> place<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.760> America<00:02:22.300> it's

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
it doesn't take place in America it's

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.750 
it doesn't take place in America it's
not<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> dystopian<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.800> sounds<00:02:24.130> very<00:02:24.430> much<00:02:24.700> like

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
not a dystopian it sounds very much like

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.380 
not a dystopian it sounds very much like
you<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.739> adventure<00:02:26.739> but<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.670> definitely<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
you know adventure but just definitely a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.170 
you know adventure but just definitely a
lot<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:29.980> serious<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.819> it's<00:02:31.000> like

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
lot you know it's serious but it's like

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.110 
lot you know it's serious but it's like
it's<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.630> lot<00:02:31.810> different<00:02:32.050> than<00:02:32.440> your<00:02:32.739> usual

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it's a lot different than your usual

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.759 
it's a lot different than your usual
contemporary<00:02:34.120> novels<00:02:34.630> total<00:02:35.290> opposite<00:02:35.739> of

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
contemporary novels total opposite of

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.000 
contemporary novels total opposite of

on Santiago i believe the summary made
it<00:03:30.370> seem<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.940> because<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.329> talks<00:03:31.540> about

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
about a boy who has been building trees

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.159 
about a boy who has been building trees
most<00:05:40.580> of<00:05:40.700> his<00:05:40.790> life<00:05:41.030> because<00:05:41.210> he's<00:05:41.570> never<00:05:41.840> seen

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
most of his life because he's never seen

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.140 
most of his life because he's never seen
a<00:05:42.200> real<00:05:42.440> tree<00:05:42.710> all<00:05:43.070> he<00:05:43.310> knows<00:05:43.490> are<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.850> stories

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
a real tree all he knows are the stories

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.670 
a real tree all he knows are the stories
his<00:05:44.300> father<00:05:44.540> tells<00:05:44.840> him<00:05:45.020> until<00:05:45.320> his<00:05:45.470> father

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
his father tells him until his father

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.530 
his father tells him until his father
dies<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.640> knee<00:05:46.790> goes<00:05:47.030> in<00:05:47.180> search<00:05:47.330> of

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
dies and the knee goes in search of

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.920 
dies and the knee goes in search of
these<00:05:48.050> real<00:05:48.410> trees<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.220> uh<00:05:49.790> I<00:05:50.270> guess<00:05:50.660> this<00:05:50.840> is

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
these real trees and uh I guess this is

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.290 
these real trees and uh I guess this is
kind<00:05:51.080> of<00:05:51.229> like<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:52.340> know<00:05:52.370> coming-of-age

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
kind of like a you know coming-of-age

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.530 
kind of like a you know coming-of-age
tale<00:05:53.530> seems<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.770> little<00:05:54.979> bit<00:05:55.220> like<00:05:55.460> a<00:05:55.880> wizard<00:05:56.240> of

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
tale seems a little bit like a wizard of

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.840 
tale seems a little bit like a wizard of
oz<00:05:56.780> just<00:05:57.290> kind<00:05:57.590> of<00:05:57.620> like<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.950> journey<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
oz just kind of like the journey to the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.540 
oz just kind of like the journey to the
wizard<00:05:59.180> kind<00:05:59.690> of<00:05:59.840> thing<00:06:00.080> not<00:06:00.979> quite<00:06:01.280> be

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
wizard kind of thing not quite be

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.580 
wizard kind of thing not quite be
falling<00:06:02.030> into<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.360> dream<00:06:02.630> state<00:06:02.930> kind<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.380> thing

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
falling into a dream state kind of thing

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.159 
falling into a dream state kind of thing
so<00:06:04.220> it<00:06:05.000> looks<00:06:05.150> kind<00:06:05.390> of<00:06:05.479> interesting<00:06:05.570> I've

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
so it looks kind of interesting I've

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.960 
so it looks kind of interesting I've
never<00:06:06.380> seen<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:06.950> book<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.640> has<00:06:07.760> been
