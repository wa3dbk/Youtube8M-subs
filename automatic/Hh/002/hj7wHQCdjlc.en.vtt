00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
microphone I can move it around you know

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000 
microphone I can move it around you know
to<00:02:20.220> four<00:02:20.820> different<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.440> my

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to four different you know things my

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
to four different you know things my
amplifier<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.700> set<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.970> next<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
amplifier can set it next to that and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.820 
amplifier can set it next to that and
get<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> better<00:02:25.050> sound<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.590> having<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
get a better sound of that having to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.030 
get a better sound of that having to
crank<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> amp<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.870> cord<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.470> actually

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
crank the amp up the cord is actually

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.470 
crank the amp up the cord is actually
pretty<00:02:29.250> long<00:02:29.520> I'm<00:02:29.730> gonna<00:02:29.820> say<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.270> good

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
pretty long I'm gonna say it's a good

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.270 
pretty long I'm gonna say it's a good

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
languages so if you're curious on how it

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.150

sounds<00:02:51.390> playing<00:02:52.260> music<00:02:52.710> with<00:02:52.860> different

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
sounds playing music with different

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.670 
sounds playing music with different
tracks<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.090> program<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.600> used<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:54.900> audacity<00:02:55.500> I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
tracks the program I used was audacity I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.550 
tracks the program I used was audacity I
didn't<00:02:56.040> spend<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> whole<00:02:56.310> lot<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.640> time<00:02:56.880> editing

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
didn't spend a whole lot of time editing

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.480 
didn't spend a whole lot of time editing
so<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.950> could<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.160> sounded<00:02:59.430> a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
so I think it could have sounded a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.530 
so I think it could have sounded a
little<00:02:59.610> better<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:02.240> anyways<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.390> hope<00:03:03.480> you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
little better but anyways I hope you

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.570 
little better but anyways I hope you
