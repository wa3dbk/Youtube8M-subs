 of health sciences first the population increase 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.979
 what does that mean as we can for us to identify 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.979
 It's not the skin type 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.640

 the system is much longer than 10 pesos much more difficult to 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.450
 identify 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.890
 not for nothing but because many times 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.120
 in them something simply left us with the face of an angel, unfortunately, models 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.020

 integration 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.999
 that's going to be the party figure 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.309
 the 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.240
 just check how the street reacts 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.709

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.650
 in nasser end in berkeley and moving little by little they go because it's a subject 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.390
 quite complicated especially 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.120
 at the time of buying a cream that the artist created makes the minivan 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.709
 no one once we have already told you what our exploration will be 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.979
 let's dedicate 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.349
 to see inside the skin normally the cie 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.269

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.420
 a care for that type of skin and having human activity for more 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.550
 time the skin 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.720
 in my career that limited to saying I'm going to try 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.990
 not only 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.329
 He said how he can identify 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.049

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.150
 simple if you had ever lived 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.849

 the next level 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.489
 in the beginning it was only the placenta 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.879
 let me see hector comments zamora low and that seems 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.870
 I think the idea is pretty good because it's very difficult to identify the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.840
 type of skin 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.859

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.869

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:47.059
 in that there is a kind of in main mobile movie millionaire awards 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.010

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.609
 aena, you have to be brave 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.889
 So nothing 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.279
 that the good one I am going to say one thing that never gave a lot of claim writer 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.589

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.870

 this is how he expressed it today, making a convulsive full shock 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.889
 when we get here in this matter it should affect five hundred writer I'll 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.320
