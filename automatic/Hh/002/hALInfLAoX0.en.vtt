but<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:10.220> said<00:05:11.220> score<00:05:11.610> chain<00:05:11.850> at<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.090> bottom<00:05:12.390> so

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
but I said score chain at the bottom so

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.870 
but I said score chain at the bottom so
I<00:05:12.570> guess<00:05:12.780> officially<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.530> called<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.340> score

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
I guess officially it is called a score

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.480 
I guess officially it is called a score
chain<00:05:15.180> not<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.510> kill<00:05:15.930> streak<00:05:16.110> like<00:05:16.620> most<00:05:17.160> people

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
chain not a kill streak like most people

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.990 
chain not a kill streak like most people
are<00:05:17.610> calling<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:19.950> don't<00:05:20.460> know<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.669> guess<00:05:20.850> I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
are calling it so I don't know I guess I

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.230 
are calling it so I don't know I guess I
just<00:05:21.530> clarify<00:05:22.530> that<00:05:23.010> up<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:25.080> don't<00:05:25.830> know<00:05:26.240> what

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
just clarify that up I don't know what

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.380 
just clarify that up I don't know what
the<00:05:27.479> highest<00:05:28.010> score<00:05:29.010> chain<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.850> think<00:05:30.120> the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
the highest score chain I think the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.210 
the highest score chain I think the
highest<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.960> can<00:05:30.990> go<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.710> 600<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:33.020> then

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
highest you can go to is 600 and then

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.560 
highest you can go to is 600 and then
after<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.430> guess<00:05:35.760> you're<00:05:35.970> done<00:05:36.180> after

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
after that I guess you're done after

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.500 
after that I guess you're done after
that<00:05:36.600> but<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.190> far<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.550> highest<00:05:38.910> I've<00:05:39.060> got<00:05:39.300> to

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
that but so far the highest I've got to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.730 
that but so far the highest I've got to
was<00:05:39.750> like<00:05:39.780> 400<00:05:40.770> or<00:05:41.520> 450<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.440> haven't<00:05:43.440> played<00:05:43.590> it
