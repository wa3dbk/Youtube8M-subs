nice stable platform for the ticket so

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.830 
nice stable platform for the ticket so
it's<00:01:52.400> actually<00:01:52.550> perhaps<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.420> little<00:01:53.690> more

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's actually perhaps a little more

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's actually perhaps a little more
stable<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.890> otherwise<00:01:55.220> would<00:01:55.550> be

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
stable then it otherwise would be

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.060 
stable then it otherwise would be
normally<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.480> would<00:01:56.630> sit<00:01:56.930> on<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.230> two<00:01:57.770> wheels

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
normally it would sit on the two wheels

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.760 
normally it would sit on the two wheels
but<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.480> rack<00:01:59.780> forms<00:02:00.230> an<00:02:00.320> even<00:02:00.530> better

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
but the rack forms an even better

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.280 
but the rack forms an even better
platform<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:02.180> ticket<00:02:02.570> once<00:02:02.780> it's<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.140> its
