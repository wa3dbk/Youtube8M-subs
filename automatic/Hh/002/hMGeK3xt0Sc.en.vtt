of the reasons I wanted to do this was I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.410 
of the reasons I wanted to do this was I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.089 
get stuck with an 18 pack
I<00:00:20.450> should<00:00:20.779> never<00:00:20.960> brought<00:00:21.290> homebrew<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:22.010> an

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
enjoy homebrew or be afraid to try it

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.880 
enjoy homebrew or be afraid to try it
bought<00:00:28.880> an<00:00:29.000> 18<00:00:29.330> pack<00:00:29.600> I<00:00:29.779> get<00:00:29.930> stuck<00:00:30.199> with<00:00:30.230> an<00:00:30.529> 18

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
bought an 18 pack I get stuck with an 18

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.340 
bought an 18 pack I get stuck with an 18
pack<00:00:31.100> so<00:00:31.880> that<00:00:32.119> gave<00:00:32.270> me<00:00:32.330> the<00:00:32.540> idea<00:00:32.660> that<00:00:33.050> we

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
pack so that gave me the idea that we

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.890 
pack so that gave me the idea that we
would<00:00:33.559> do<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.890> for<00:00:34.129> our<00:00:34.280> budget<00:00:35.059> beer<00:00:35.540> review

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
would do it for our budget beer review

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.960 
would do it for our budget beer review
because<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:36.470> was<00:00:36.760> reasonable

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
because it was reasonable

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.770 
because it was reasonable
I<00:00:38.000> get<00:00:38.420> randomly<00:00:38.980> $12.50<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.400> 18<00:00:41.180> pack<00:00:41.480> so

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
I get randomly $12.50 for a 18 pack so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.410 
I get randomly $12.50 for a 18 pack so
that<00:00:41.809> puts<00:00:42.170> us<00:00:42.290> low<00:00:42.500> under<00:00:42.770> six<00:00:43.100> dollar<00:00:43.420> mark

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
that puts us low under six dollar mark

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.700 
that puts us low under six dollar mark
for<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.660> six<00:00:44.989> pack<00:00:45.230> this<00:00:46.040> is<00:00:46.220> in<00:00:46.370> cans

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
for a six pack this is in cans

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.410 
for a six pack this is in cans

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
our one shot to do it I know what else

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.050 
our one shot to do it I know what else
you're<00:01:21.710> saving<00:01:22.039> it<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:22.340> like<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:22.729> barely

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
you're saving it but like this barely

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.999 
you're saving it but like this barely
qualifies<00:01:23.720> as<00:01:23.930> Barry<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.470> you're<00:01:24.649> right<00:01:24.830> it

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
qualifies as Barry and you're right it

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.730 
qualifies as Barry and you're right it
barely<00:01:25.970> qualifies<00:01:26.570> as<00:01:26.750> beer<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.259> does<00:01:27.470> and

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
barely qualifies as beer but it does and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.590 
barely qualifies as beer but it does and
a<00:01:27.770> matter<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.070> fact<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.490> makes<00:01:29.270> up<00:01:29.479> a

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
a matter of fact it makes up a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.539 
a matter of fact it makes up a
substantial<00:01:30.259> portion<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.860> American<00:01:30.950> beer

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
substantial portion of the American beer

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.139 
substantial portion of the American beer
market<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.860> this<00:01:33.860> channel<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.369> all<00:01:34.580> about<00:01:34.640> beer

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
market so this channel is all about beer

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.639 
market so this channel is all about beer
it<00:01:35.840> would<00:01:36.229> be<00:01:36.580> probably<00:01:37.580> inappropriateness

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
it would be probably inappropriateness

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.649 
it would be probably inappropriateness
for<00:01:39.649> us<00:01:39.770> at<00:01:39.979> some<00:01:40.220> point<00:01:40.250> not<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:41.000> discuss<00:01:41.119> Bud

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
for us at some point not to discuss Bud

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.240 
for us at some point not to discuss Bud
Light

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
Light

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
Light
so<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:45.610> how<00:01:45.730> this<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> going<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.180> go<00:01:46.360> said

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
so that's how this is going to go said

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.690 
so that's how this is going to go said
we'll<00:01:47.530> review<00:01:47.980> at<00:01:48.640> least<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:49.060> major<00:01:49.240> three

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
we'll review at least the major three

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.120 
we'll review at least the major three
probably<00:01:51.700> not<00:01:52.120> more<00:01:52.330> than<00:01:52.540> four<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.950> if

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
probably not more than four so if

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.520 
probably not more than four so if
there's<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.690> somebody<00:01:55.690> really<00:01:56.050> wants<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.350> put

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
there's one somebody really wants to put

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.650 
there's one somebody really wants to put
two<00:01:56.620> head<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.800> head<00:01:57.010> against<00:01:57.910> big<00:01:58.180> three<00:01:58.450> let

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
two head to head against big three let

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.880 
two head to head against big three let
me<00:01:58.750> know<00:01:58.870> we'll<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.410> it<00:01:59.500> done

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
me know we'll get it done

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.320 
me know we'll get it done
if<00:02:00.640> not<00:02:00.850> we'll<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.300> stick<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.780> big<00:02:01.960> three

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
if not we'll just stick to the big three

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.940 
if not we'll just stick to the big three
so<00:02:04.330> we're<00:02:04.570> going<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.720> taste<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.800> other

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
so we're going to taste it the other

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.410 
so we're going to taste it the other

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
in a world so it might actually be a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.780 
in a world so it might actually be a
good<00:02:24.880> experiment<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.630> see<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.490> these

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
