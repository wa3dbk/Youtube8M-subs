on<00:02:14.230> each<00:02:14.260> side<00:02:14.670> form<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.880> completely<00:02:16.600> good<00:02:16.840> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
on each side form not completely good I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.170 
on each side form not completely good I
could<00:02:17.560> have<00:02:17.650> gotten<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.160> more<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
could have gotten a little bit more you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
could have gotten a little bit more you
know<00:02:19.300> range<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.050> motion<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.459> good<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
know range of motion but it's good it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.240 
know range of motion but it's good it's
good<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.060> press<00:02:22.690> yourself<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.470> heavier

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
good to press yourself to do heavier

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.970 
good to press yourself to do heavier
things<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.850> then<00:02:25.090> perfect<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.110> form<00:02:26.380> until

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
things and then perfect the form until

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460 
things and then perfect the form until
you<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.580> weight<00:02:27.820> correctly<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.320> like

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you can do that weight correctly so like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.500 
you can do that weight correctly so like
I<00:02:29.590> said<00:02:29.770> before<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:31.180> heavy

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
I said before it's it's really heavy

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.420 
I said before it's it's really heavy
full<00:02:31.900> time<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.590> eating<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.920> lot<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.250> food

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
full time so I'm eating a lot of food

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190 
full time so I'm eating a lot of food
and<00:02:33.610> doing<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.000> lot<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.270> strength<00:02:34.660> exercises

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and doing a lot of strength exercises

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.900 
and doing a lot of strength exercises
I'm<00:02:35.380> really<00:02:35.560> trying<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.769> put<00:02:35.980> heavy<00:02:36.370> heavy

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
I'm really trying to put heavy heavy

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.880 
I'm really trying to put heavy heavy
weight<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.780> machines<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.650> working

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
weight on the machines and it's working

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.190 
weight on the machines and it's working
