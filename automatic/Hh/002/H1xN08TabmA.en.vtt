00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
how do you create the proper release

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960 
how do you create the proper release
there<00:00:07.080> are<00:00:07.140> two<00:00:07.290> factors<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.189> proper<00:00:08.490> fit<00:00:08.700> and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
there are two factors the proper fit and

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.290 
there are two factors the proper fit and
in<00:00:09.450> proper<00:00:09.719> grip<00:00:10.010> proper<00:00:11.010> fit<00:00:11.250> will<00:00:12.000> determine

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
in proper grip proper fit will determine

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.140 
in proper grip proper fit will determine
how<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.230> grip<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.530> ball<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.830> also<00:00:14.730> how<00:00:15.120> you

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
how you grip the ball and also how you

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.660 
how you grip the ball and also how you
release<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> ball<00:00:16.340> getting<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> proper

release the ball getting a proper
release<00:00:17.990> is<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> create<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:20.100> only

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
release is going to create not only

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.390 
release is going to create not only
speed<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.820> rotation<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.900> control<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> by

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
speed and rotation but control so by

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040 
speed and rotation but control so by
having<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> proper<00:00:23.939> release<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.930> going

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
having the proper release you're going

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.410 
having the proper release you're going
to<00:00:25.109> create<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.680> much<00:00:26.189> stronger<00:00:26.490> game<00:00:26.789> much<00:00:27.390> more

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

to create a much stronger game much more
consistent<00:00:27.990> release<00:00:28.260> creates<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.429> much<00:00:30.000> higher

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
consistent release creates a much higher
