the<00:01:12.050> image<00:01:12.470> plate<00:01:17.140> did<00:01:18.140> not<00:01:18.350> work<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.860> time

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
the image plate did not work this time

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.490 
the image plate did not work this time
this<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.759> usually<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.300> part<00:01:20.600> at<00:01:20.869> my<00:01:21.080> darling

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.290 
does from him it's not really nail
friendly<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.240> tend<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.899> skip<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.679> but<00:01:28.300> it's

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
friendly so I tend to skip it but it's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.850 
friendly so I tend to skip it but it's
kind<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.959> mandatory<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:31.599> you<00:01:32.599> get<00:01:32.990> warnings

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
kind of mandatory and you get warnings

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.419 
kind of mandatory and you get warnings
that<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.220> should<00:01:34.459> remain<00:01:34.849> a<00:01:35.090> remove<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.429> foil

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
that you should remain a remove the foil

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.279 
that you should remain a remove the foil
but<00:01:38.179> I<00:01:39.459> had<00:01:40.459> a<00:01:40.819> couple<00:01:41.179> of<00:01:41.420> instances<00:01:41.750> that

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
but I had a couple of instances that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.980 
but I had a couple of instances that
people<00:01:42.979> thought<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.819> packaging<00:01:44.750> around

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
people thought that the packaging around

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.089 
people thought that the packaging around
this<00:01:45.470> was<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.429> file<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.700> should<00:01:47.090> be<00:01:47.300> removed

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
this was the file that should be removed

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.889 
this was the file that should be removed
but<00:01:49.099> this<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.390> foil<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.869> should<00:01:51.770> go<00:01:52.220> down

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
but this is the foil that should go down

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.279 
but this is the foil that should go down
let's<00:01:53.899> see<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:54.349> I<00:01:54.500> manage<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.890> do<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.330> not
