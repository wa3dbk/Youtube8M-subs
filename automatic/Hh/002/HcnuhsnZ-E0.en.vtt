 an entadinha a main course and a 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.690
 dessert the entrade of today will be 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.420
 a gazpacho the tomato is interesting to 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.220
 people choose the more red ones that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.700
 We can do it because it will. 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.980
 give a nice color the gas part and then there 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.630
 choose any type of tomato I 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.880
 I especially like tomato 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.070
 Deborah that is more tasty is just 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.739
 interesting than the tomato 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.840
 cherry because cherry tomato it is very 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.360
 acid so it's part can not stay so 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.940
 acid so 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.579
 good people will now speak of the little that 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.019
 can be either the Japanese cucumber or 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.390
 country cucumber 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.070
 But I'm particularly here today. 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 seeing that the cucumber is more 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.549
 fresh 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.010
 he's never as good as cucumber 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.710
 Japanese then I'll choose the cucumber 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.240
 also remembering that if he 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.520
 have more blueberries like that 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.009
 without any better bruises 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.680
 he is cooler 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.540
 Good now I got everything I needed 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.649
 parsley onion and garlic 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.649
 now for the kitchen 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.340
 this recipe is super easy first I'll go 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.740
 cut the hawthorn tomato which is what the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.590
 people bought that little one fell him 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.080
 tends to bitter when we do not 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.230
 this trick or teach you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.440
 we cut the tips and the tip that 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.060
 left the rubs to not bitter 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.910
 he has a very thick shell 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.160
 So I 'm going to remove some of the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.200
 vegetable peeler or be careful 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.330
 to take the seeds of the little one too 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.330
 because only he is very indigestible 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.090
 Chili remembering to take part 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.319
 seed and despise the onion and the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 garlic 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.030
 in parallel to obtain boiling water 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.099
 where I'll pass the bell peppers to the onion 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
 and garlic quickly only for names 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.810
 caudate now play immediately one 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.019
 water with ice 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.690
 so she cooks and vegetables stand 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.760
 crispy 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 now the chili onion will drain and the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.480
 garlic 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040
 I will join with the other businesses 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.750
 vegetables all here now had to get 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.210
 turn with salt 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.990
 Extra virgin olive oil can be a good 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.120
 present amount and vinegar and 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.910
 tree has to be apple cider vinegar 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.100
 it gets much softer taste too 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.110
 It's better to choose a good vice 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.330
 in the group will make all the difference 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 I will now take the bread and been cut in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.020
 coarse pieces and put on top 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.810
 of vegetables that have already been greeted 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.150
 seasoned and cut over the bread 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.140
 put the ice and take to the refrigerator for 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.140
 at least eight hours 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.989
 now that I've hit jacko I'm going 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.640
 try the salt if you have good salt to 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:55.150
 People do not come for more if they have 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.580
 missing coca but then the space 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.730
 tempered if you want 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.120
 serve at a cocktail party 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.299
 something like that you serve cups 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.330

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.730
