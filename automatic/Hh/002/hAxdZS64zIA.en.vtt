00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hi to all of you guys today we are here not 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.429
 I saw the dix dix today I have to see 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.230
 how to install nodes 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.690
 I stopped making videos because I thought 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.059
 not to make so much importance in the videos 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.539
 but since the other video I did 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.640
 type 109 views anyway 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.920
 you will need to download this file here nodus 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.530
 by me some simply by binding 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 on this site here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.739
 this is my wait file 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.570
 wait for it to be via san via alone if 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.020
 the other does not do it as a Cretan base 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020
 it says 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.800
 feel and where it is written, wait for it 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.850
 that I joined waiting for them 10 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 seconds 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.750
 then there are more people click on it and 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.530
 they came if he does it automatically 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.590
 it does it automatically however this is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.620
 the file once installed will open to you 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.680
 this one that you will move it to 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.140
 desktop collage posten desktop will open 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.420
 so 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.600
 there is also also I did a 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 rhythms that young people remain then i 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.240
 various steps go to the start menu and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.960
 write a hundred percent inhabited 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.890
 now let's make a start for one hundred 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.890
 suitable for one hundred 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.800
 we open the right roaming 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.130
 no 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.740
 stop ok then open let's see what 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.740
 we have to go to minecraft point 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.730
 then what else tells us to those TVs yet 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.910
 with these mine then doing this 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.500
 but then delete as many as eight minecraft 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.240
 I don't worry about this right now 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.010
 if you want to win well, it's not changing 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.800
 something 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.050
 delete and once that is done 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.210
 insert the file that is inside 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.000
 of a load but in comparison yellow ok 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.710
 once this is done we want this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.850

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.800

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.300
 a little faster though it takes a while 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.090
 opening up with names was for a moment 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.990
 that ends his time to open up e 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.990
 then we open it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.250

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.420
