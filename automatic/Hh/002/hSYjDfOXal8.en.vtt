twenty-five dollars I've had him for a
long<00:00:12.510> time<00:00:13.010> even<00:00:14.010> though<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.220> haven't<00:00:14.460> used

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
long time even though I haven't used

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.460 
long time even though I haven't used
them<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.880> much<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.270> soles<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.230> front

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
them that much in the soles in the front

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.609 
them that much in the soles in the front
I<00:00:16.529> noticed<00:00:17.130> they<00:00:17.189> started<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> come<00:00:17.730> off<00:00:17.759> and<00:00:18.619> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I noticed they started to come off and I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890 
I noticed they started to come off and I
really<00:00:20.220> don't<00:00:20.460> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> buy<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> new

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
really don't want to have to buy a new

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
really don't want to have to buy a new
pair<00:00:22.019> because<00:00:22.439> over<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:22.890> cost<00:00:23.099> about<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pair because over here they cost about a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
pair because over here they cost about a
hundred<00:00:23.400> dollars<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.539> least<00:00:25.579> anyways<00:00:26.579> I<00:00:27.179> had

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
hundred dollars at least anyways I had

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.140 
hundred dollars at least anyways I had
another<00:00:28.289> pair<00:00:28.499> before<00:00:28.919> and<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.579> sole<00:00:29.789> started

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
another pair before and the sole started

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.550 
another pair before and the sole started
to<00:00:30.210> come<00:00:30.329> off<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> left<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.989> a<00:00:31.050> bit<00:00:31.199> long<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to come off and I left it a bit long and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
to come off and I left it a bit long and
it's<00:00:31.829> actually<00:00:32.190> once<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.490> let<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.360> start<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's actually once you let them start to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's actually once you let them start to
come<00:00:34.380> off<00:00:34.530> becomes<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.760> harder<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.210> fix<00:00:36.680> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
come off becomes a lot harder to fix so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
come off becomes a lot harder to fix so
I<00:00:37.710> wanted<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> new<00:00:38.670> pit<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> butt<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.300> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I wanted to new pit in the butt and I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
I wanted to new pit in the butt and I
took<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.590> them<00:00:40.740> sewed<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
took it down to get them sewed and I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.500 
took it down to get them sewed and I
noticed<00:00:41.580> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> third<00:00:41.940> world<00:00:42.120> there's<00:00:42.330> a<00:00:42.390> lot

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
noticed in the third world there's a lot

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
noticed in the third world there's a lot
of<00:00:42.600> places<00:00:42.780> where<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.380> this<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of places where you can do this kind of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.620 
of places where you can do this kind of
stuff<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.940> exactly<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.360> same<00:00:45.420> thing

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
stuff they do the exactly the same thing

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.370 
stuff they do the exactly the same thing
in<00:00:45.900> Honduras<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.900> know<00:00:48.990> it<00:00:49.080> really<00:00:49.140> makes

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
in Honduras and you know it really makes

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.710 
in Honduras and you know it really makes
your<00:00:49.530> shoes<00:00:49.770> last<00:00:50.070> quite<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.310> lot<00:00:50.490> longer

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
your shoes last quite a lot longer

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.490 
your shoes last quite a lot longer
especially<00:00:51.720> these<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.080> people<00:00:52.350> buy

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
especially these a lot of people buy

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.950 
especially these a lot of people buy
cheap<00:00:53.010> shoes<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.670> cheap<00:00:53.960> Chinese

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
cheap shoes here like cheap Chinese

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.530 
cheap shoes here like cheap Chinese
running<00:00:55.320> shoes<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.740> they<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.580> do<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
running shoes and they just do this to

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.570 
running shoes and they just do this to
them<00:00:57.660> immediately<00:00:58.250> because<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.400> I<00:00:59.520> said

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
them immediately because like I said

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.280 
them immediately because like I said
once<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.060> start<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> come<00:01:00.510> apart<00:01:00.630> it's<00:01:00.990> it's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
once they start to come apart it's it's

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.870 
once they start to come apart it's it's
harder<00:01:01.740> to<00:01:01.950> get<00:01:02.100> them<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.310> know<00:01:02.400> to<00:01:02.460> glue<00:01:02.730> them

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
harder to get them you know to glue them

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.209 
harder to get them you know to glue them
back<00:01:02.910> together<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.499> you<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.859> it<00:01:04.920> if

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
back together so if you just do it if

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:06.499 
back together so if you just do it if
you<00:01:05.429> get<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.609> pair<00:01:05.789> of<00:01:05.880> shoes<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.179> you<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
you get a pair of shoes and you do it

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.529 
you get a pair of shoes and you do it
first<00:01:06.719> off<00:01:07.820> it'll<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.090> last<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.420> lot

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
first off it'll make them last a lot

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.929 
first off it'll make them last a lot
longer<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.399> you<00:01:11.399> know<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
longer and you know it's something that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.029 
longer and you know it's something that
in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> United<00:01:12.749> States<00:01:12.990> nobody<00:01:13.590> does<00:01:13.799> anymore

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
in the United States nobody does anymore

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.099 
in the United States nobody does anymore
it's<00:01:14.729> cheaper<00:01:15.119> probably<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.630> buy<00:01:15.749> a<00:01:15.780> new<00:01:15.960> pair

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
it's cheaper probably to buy a new pair

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.440 
it's cheaper probably to buy a new pair
of<00:01:16.170> shoes<00:01:16.259> than<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> pay<00:01:16.859> someone<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.399> do<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
of shoes than to pay someone to do this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.910 
of shoes than to pay someone to do this
they<00:01:19.380> did<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.990> $2<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.649> didn't<00:01:22.829> even

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they did this for $2 but I didn't even

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
they did this for $2 but I didn't even
negotiate<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.789> them<00:01:23.969> to<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> seemed

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
negotiate with them to me it seemed

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.880 
negotiate with them to me it seemed
pretty<00:01:24.600> reasonable<00:01:25.109> so<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.289> said<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.649> fine<00:01:25.859> but

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
pretty reasonable so I said and fine but

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
pretty reasonable so I said and fine but
I<00:01:26.310> mean<00:01:26.549> maybe<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.030> could<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.299> gotten<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I mean maybe I could have gotten a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.590 
I mean maybe I could have gotten a
little<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:27.990> cheaper<00:01:28.289> but<00:01:28.469> um<00:01:29.429> anyways<00:01:30.420> check

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
little bit cheaper but um anyways check

00:01:30.600 --> 00:02:03.100 
little bit cheaper but um anyways check
it<00:01:30.749> out<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.139> how<00:01:31.859> they<00:01:31.889> do<00:01:32.130> it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:04:25.210 

you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:45.850 

I<00:04:31.810> will<00:04:32.810> do<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> normal<00:04:33.260> water

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:05:07.490 

my<00:04:46.099> toddler<00:04:46.550> go
