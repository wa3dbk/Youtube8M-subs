00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.830
 here bringing you from the videotutorial text 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.130
 this time is the talk about how 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.090
 have free internet on samsung galaxy 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.250
 android 2.3 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.940
 ok the first thing to do is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.610
 download the application to occupy that in 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.720
 this case would be mini opera with 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.930
 modification for the internet although a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.220
 Once they unload it, let's put it in 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.079
 the sd of the phone and let's find it if 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.879
 to you 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.609
 if it was the coincidence that you were not 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.909
 I recognized some I knew they would have to 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.789
 install a java device you seek it 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.390
 in the cold play and there you will find it 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.369
 the device java ok 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.100
 here is it usually installed as 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:58.769
 they tell any application that to me 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.899
 says that it replaces because I already have it 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.119
 installed but I'm going to give you cancel 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.670
 but you install him normal once 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:12.189
 installed we're going to go to configurations 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.189
 let's go to wireless connections 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.300
 with city mobile networks 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 and we will see names of points of 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.580
 access 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 you should have these two if you do not have the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.210
 they're going to create one here here and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.939
 add and search in a tutorial in 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 youtube or in google in the current ones 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.479
 islands what goes here to put it ok by 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.510
 if they do not have them but if they have this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.080
 they leave it and they're going to let's 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.330
 if you have if you have this option activated 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.980
 of using data packets leaves it but 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:00.220
 if you have not activated it 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.220
 ok now we are going to the program 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.979
 we go to the program 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.530
 ok look, he's going to ask us 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.119
 configurations these configurations 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.119
 I'll leave them in 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.879
 in the description but it only fills what 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.129
 what is back I wanted to leave in the 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.640
 description we will select in 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:31.069
 remove port will select host 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 and here we go to another other configuration and 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.290
 that would be all that is coming to you 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.930
 password of port filter and the two 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.840
 first they do not fill up anymore then they go to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.260
 would be installed to install 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.750
 they must be connected except for Israel 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.490
 can I install I'm not connected 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.290
 because I do not currently have a network 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.440
 available although there are for you and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.230
 to install it and as you can see already 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.070
 there are six tutorials here in 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.470
 mendoza of me I like free internet 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.840
 ok and once you are installed of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.570
 you close it and disable the wifi 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.780
 they shut on and off the wifi good 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.709
 so they can see that they do not spend any balance 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.709
 check the balance 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.400
 let's check the balance 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.030
 they shoot you 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.850
 how can you see your friend balance is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.880
 Exhausted 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.880
 Now let's go here and we 're going to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.610
 let's see something to see 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.610
 to google 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.120
 let's hope they charge a little bit in 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.340
 load the event as you can see 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.980

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.230
 disadvantages that are being 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:30.820
