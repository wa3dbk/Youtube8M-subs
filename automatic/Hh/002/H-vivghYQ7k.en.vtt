00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.340
 I'll explain how I make the pudding 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.680
 of apple takes 6 games a terrine of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.270
 can 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.930
 6 tablespoons of sugar this is for alpha 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.330
 It has three tablespoons of sugar and two 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.869
 tablespoons of water this is to do the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.610
 candy to throw it on the bottom of the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.360
 kilo 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.650
 We are going to throw these apples here in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.480
 that casserole is 6 medium apples more 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.480
 well small 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.850
 and two tablespoons of butter 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.890
 we are not going to do it little by little 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.870
 Slowly, little is being done 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.750
 little until it is done the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.030
 apples half done because the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.030
 another half are going to be done 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.950
 then this we are going to leave doing 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 little by little we are already doing the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.230
 candy for the mold and now we're going to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520
 do 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.369
 or not 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.690
 the flan 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:29.180
 there are already 6 eggs now we throw 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.130
 the high queen of cream 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.369
 normal silver of the mountain 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.369
 is now and now 6 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.590
 all this approved maximums 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.080
 and now let's wait for it to be 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.920
 candy and apples 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.760
 they stay half cooked and then we continue 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 with the next step 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.360
 this fruit 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.360
 now in the boat 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.049
 chaste 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.740
 now we do a marketing like that so that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.740
 they leave 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.000
 but when a little bit the walls of the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 mold with candy 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.989
 you are already not seeing 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.710
 the candy is now ready 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.510
 we will wait 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.510
 to apples are made 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.950
 You see they are doing they need to get 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.930
 a little more not quite but little more 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.960
 and then they finish doing with the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.819
 pudding in the beginning the apples are already 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.180
 made 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.900
 we are going to mix them 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.900
 with the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.540
 we do it done in 4 pieces 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.280
 it does not matter that they leave you dear 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.600
 because then there are very nice men 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.340
 and evil 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.300
 the Jew we mix everything we throw everything 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.300
 on top of the mold 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.379
 and we already have it ready to put it 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.870
 baked that we have put it to 180 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.530
 degrees 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.530
 I knew everything 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.520
 with a container of water to do it 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.520
 talking maria 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.550
 then we were there 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 half of the container with water 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.920
 It's enough 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.450
 we close it and now we will calculate three 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.310
 quarters of an hour more and you're done 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.310
 we're going to take it out of the oven 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.580
 we have put the paper or oak red 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.580
 so that he does not stay 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.720
 because sometimes you do not need it 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.380
 more time and above I know how bad 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.840
 served then and us and that 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.530
 now we take it out of the text there what 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.530
 let cool 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.360
 we had at the end one hour 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.980
 in the oven the same day is and now 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.660
 we wait for the Canary Islands and then we 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.660
 we overflow and another case 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.380
 once cold we dismantled it 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.950
 we place and it's that beautiful and 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.220
 very rich and I hope you like it and 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.220
 the next
