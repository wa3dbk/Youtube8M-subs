00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 The good thing is that it explodes on its own. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.280
 possible in congo white sand is chalet 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.210
 a phenomenon of nature among 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 residents 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.910
 since Wednesday people in a radius 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.279
 10 kilometers of stone hear noise 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.880
 similar or even greater than a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.630
 Thunder 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.119
 we started to see that it hit fourth 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 on the trade. 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.340
 that noise and gives it to Thursday 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.099
 that a dam there right 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.680
 I'll be worried about 11 hours later. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 of the night coming out that could happen 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 worse thing 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.879
 we look at there the imagination 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 to rain right? 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 Gilmar was very tall and after living 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 ae one slot 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 the noise happens in the night 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 after the scare the owner of the house 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 next to the mountain is not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.920
 fear blanket collision a little that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.320
 quiet environment dam a little ne 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.619
 unlike her husband, the hero, and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.450
 It has not yet recovered the two exchange 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.500
 imagine who was leaving for 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.540
 inside the rock and we rise to the explosion 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.540
 we heard from here it looks like it was 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.360
 arriving at that high there and took a lot 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.970
 their have never seen such a thing 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.250
 by our sock that potent the phenomenon 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.650
 mysterious is causing us 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.409
 last days more than a thousand people already 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.049
 visited the place to discover the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.540
 what is happening or even killing 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 curiosity and also if there were any 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.299
 thing to interdict place for the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.270
 people do not stay in it is very dangerous 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.189
 the rock that exploded like this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 known in this mountain stream 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.820
 white sand in cottage of approx. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.860
 200 meters 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.960
 the case is still a mystery and the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 residents are scared 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.479
 another dweller near the mountain details 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 as it was the first time that happened 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.810
 noise not aranda two and 40 in the morning 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.929
 Wednesday 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.790
 there the egg noise after I sleep 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.370
 repeated and others who heard 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.599
 My, it's already been 4 noises we did not see there. 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.909
 continued to retep me it looks like there 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.939
 have been decreasing in the mall 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.909
 I stayed on the outside what happens 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.760
 At night you can not run behind, can not you see? 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.859
 The other day I went to get my 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.829
 Up close that's right there, right? 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.549
 there I was curious to see if her ox fell 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.760
 but I saw by the noise it was not ox 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:49.450
 thereafter stepped right showed more IAEA 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 under the radar up to where the crack was, right? 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.639
 the fact arrived until the prefecture of chalet 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.470
 and the person in charge of the municipality explains 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.739
 what steps are being taken 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.379
 taken to solve the mystery and not 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.370
 are taking some steps already 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.980
 was made 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.980
 the police incident has already been reported 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.459
 the ibama and the locals more closely 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.699
 He left the house and a little scared but 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.799
 is already a fear cable and yet are 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:24.549
 worried even likely that a geologist 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.169
 I'll come here, I 'll see tomorrow, tomorrow. 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.449
 a case that did not happen in our 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.180
 region even though it is still a 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.599
 mystery visitors can perceive 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.310
 that a part of the rock has disintegrated 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.250
 yielding and falling on a crop of 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.769
 coffee making the noise louder 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.169
 already the top of the stone had a 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.709
 crack of approximately 50 meters 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:51.120
 likely to cause 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.120
 rear noises
