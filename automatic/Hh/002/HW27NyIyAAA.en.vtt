be<00:00:20.070> working<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> technique<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.359> allows

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
be working on a technique that allows

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
be working on a technique that allows
you<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> pull<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:22.439> triples<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> bass<00:00:23.609> drum

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you to pull off triples on the bass drum

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.150 
you to pull off triples on the bass drum
using<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.660> foot<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.800> right<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
using one foot so let's get right to it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.620 
using one foot so let's get right to it
have<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> important<00:00:27.000> thing<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> remember<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
have the important thing to remember is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
have the important thing to remember is
that<00:00:27.750> our<00:00:27.930> feet<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.439> hands<00:00:28.769> are

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that our feet and our hands are

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
that our feet and our hands are
basically<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> same<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> drum<00:00:30.359> set<00:00:30.599> we

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
basically the same on the drum set we

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
basically the same on the drum set we
need<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> work<00:00:31.320> both<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:31.890> regularly<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
need to work both of them regularly in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
need to work both of them regularly in
order<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.030> reach<00:00:33.239> their<00:00:33.420> full

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
order for them to reach their full

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.160 
order for them to reach their full
potential

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
potential

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.500 
potential
so<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.219> our<00:00:35.550> hands<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.000> usually<00:00:36.360> try

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so when we use our hands we usually try

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
so when we use our hands we usually try
to<00:00:36.540> learn<00:00:36.780> something<00:00:37.050> slowly<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.860> then

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to learn something slowly and then

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
to learn something slowly and then
gradually<00:00:38.460> speed<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> no

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
gradually speed it up so this is no

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.510 
gradually speed it up so this is no
different<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.530> want<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> take<00:00:41.370> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
different I want you to take this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
different I want you to take this
technique<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.210> practice<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> extremely

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
technique and practice it extremely

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709 
technique and practice it extremely
slowly<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.489> gradually<00:00:45.120> speed<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.600> at

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
slowly and then gradually speed it up at

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
slowly and then gradually speed it up at
your<00:00:45.750> own<00:00:45.899> pace<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:47.010> try<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
your own pace do not try to go just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
your own pace do not try to go just
straight<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> blistering<00:00:49.050> fast<00:00:49.350> speeds

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
straight to blistering fast speeds

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290 
straight to blistering fast speeds
because<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.250> not<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> help<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
because that's not going to help you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.819 
because that's not going to help you
it's<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> lead<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> poor<00:00:52.590> muscle

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it's just going to lead to poor muscle

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.610 
it's just going to lead to poor muscle
memory<00:00:53.160> development<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.230> you'd<00:00:55.230> rather<00:00:55.379> have

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
memory development so you'd rather have

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
memory development so you'd rather have
your<00:00:55.710> body<00:00:55.860> remember<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.670> something

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
your body remember how to do something

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.479 
your body remember how to do something
correctly<00:00:57.180> than<00:00:57.809> incorrectly<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
correctly than incorrectly so the way it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:52.050 
correctly than incorrectly so the way it
works<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> goes<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.570> ready

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.580
