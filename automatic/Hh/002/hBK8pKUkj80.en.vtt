think<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.370> move

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
think that's what they could move

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
think that's what they could move
forward<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> did<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> same<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
forward so I did the same thing and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
forward so I did the same thing and
sometimes<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.820> cut<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> from<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> neck<00:01:00.719> part

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
sometimes I cut it from the neck part
and<00:01:01.350> sometimes<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> cut<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> other

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and sometimes I cut it from the other

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.130 
and sometimes I cut it from the other
part<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.910> pinning<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> where<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> design<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
part of pinning on where that design is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
part of pinning on where that design is
on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> shirt<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> fit<00:01:06.510> and
