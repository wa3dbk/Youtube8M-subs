00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.799
 online gt5 video here has been returned 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.120
 with my friend the raccoon was by 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.030
 here giving a little spin 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.219
 mountain with which the view sought 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.480
 to make this video here all the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 city ​​of saints what beautiful is left 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 this this landscape one type of the case 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 we are here in a very special video 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 well, let it be a special super welter 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 but yes it's pretty much that this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 video is a bit different since you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 I'm going to teach how to get a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 mask at the same time we put on a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 helmet thing that will be pretty cool 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.279
 quite funny since the raccoon in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 this case you already know that he always used 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.260
 this mask for all the videos and such 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.600
 it's a nice little step that I love is 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.600
 as my 25 mascot is the best in the world 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.590
 the helmet as well as a mask 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 then why do we have to do it then 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.010
 very easy is what we have to do 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 will be to get a quad worth a blazer 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
 that the 4 that pleasure or I do not remember 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.850
 all right 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.039
 The fact is that a good part of this quad 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 also you also have to do the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 trick the shamrock guy I started with that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.719
 vehicle will also not be worth what 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.520
 happens is that I do not have the picture 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.570
 tricolor bought and well then this one was 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.250
 the cheapest here winds after me 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.510
 bought this then well then that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 we have to do it as I say we 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.460
 we come here to anywhere in the world 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.920
 we lack 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 here on this mountain in this grass 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 then you go to any point of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 wet can do up even inside 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.280
 from your garage 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 then once you have this which 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.150
 Well what you have to do will be and leave 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 to inventory accessories and we take off 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.299
 everything we have in our head 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.220
 Okay, we take everything out, there it is and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.110
 then here where you can wear a helmet 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 put it on itself so that it will serve 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.680
 this so that when we mount 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 On the motorcycle 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.159
 automatically riding on the motorcycle 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 then our character puts on the helmet 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.909
 so then well, this is what we left 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.110
 It's good then, now, once 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.399
 let's be like that, by the way, I do not like it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 nothing that my character does not wear more expensive 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.210
 because it has spots on his face 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.070
 It looks like he has caught a ketchup jar 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.149
 from the burger king model mcdonald and what 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 has caught and it has been reflected in the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.200
 load of choose the very pathetic but see 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.550
 two little guys we can not do that without 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.690
 nothing in the face and now what we have 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.280
 What to do will be a moment that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.140
 first thing that is all good ball 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.270
 we can effectively and now this does not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.649
 we're going to put this helmet on, but 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.770
 see what we are going to do is take away what 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.969
 have accessories 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.969
 and it is already 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.979
 we have the head this too 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.170
 and now what we have to do will be 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.900
 riding is what the bike is 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 and then when we mount 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.840
 we will quickly have to select the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 mask that we want is worth then nothing 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 we ride here we give the select 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.330
 inventory accessories and just with 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 this putting the helmet we give him for the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.470
 right and we put on the mask and as 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.269
 You see , the helmet will be played with the mask 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.720
 I really do not know how to do it for 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.000
 put on my helmet the other 4 helmet of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.349
 military the new helmet again dlc well 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.730
 what can be done but I think I have 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.440
 as a default that you put on my 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.819
 character always this helmet and 12 as 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.620
 balls and I do not know how you can do it for 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.440
 to put the other one to the best in the end 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.610
 of the video I leave you a video clip for 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.170
 that you see how it is with our past 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.910
 so really going out they have found out 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.319
 how to make so that instead of this helmet 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.700
 put on the car not really do not know how 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.170
 do it and I'd love to put it with the 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.400
 another because it looks cooler and also 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.840
 say very important that for this 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.099
 you stay saved so to speak 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.510
 so that every time you enter 5 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.860
 online is with the most expensive calculation to the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 Once all you have to do is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.890
 go to be worth, look, I'm just going to do 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.090
 in case you do not know it or came here to 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.660
 online my mother is driving without 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.799
 look 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.460
 I was just here to change 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.600
 character too 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.460
 character become yours and 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.960
 it will automatically stay you did not want 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.850
 be the most expensive with the helmet completely 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.260
 saved well a guy basically this 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.700
 it's something that teaching in this video will be 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.290
 that is enough I'm going as is left 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.580
 pretty good is better with the other 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.320
 drawer or I imagine it looks better 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.330
 I really have not tried it but I want to see 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.710
 to see if I get it as well as type as 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.450
 I say this you already know oak that please 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.230
 you liked to be like that lots and we can 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.230
 Approach God
