00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
going to take a little bit of finding to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.890 
going to take a little bit of finding to
get<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:07.620> where<00:03:07.830> we<00:03:08.040> need<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.370> go<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.360> can't

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.119 
Diagon how I think this is a one-block
layer<00:04:52.169> yes<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.860> darn<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:55.129> is
