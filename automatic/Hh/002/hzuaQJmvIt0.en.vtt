bad<00:03:38.669> but<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.479> don't<00:03:39.629> think<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.900> works<00:03:40.079> too<00:03:40.379> well

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
bad but I don't think it works too well

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.369 
bad but I don't think it works too well
but<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.310> really<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.509> addition<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.229> the

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
but I really like the addition of the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.349 
but I really like the addition of the
Matta<00:03:43.620> green<00:03:43.949> pieces<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.400> mean<00:03:44.790> they<00:03:45.120> look

kind of like Ben's that's just me but
that<00:04:29.639> doesn't<00:04:30.030> seem<00:04:30.150> like<00:04:30.330> it's<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.570> best

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
that doesn't seem like it's the best

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.830 
that doesn't seem like it's the best
quality<00:04:30.900> plastic<00:04:31.850> legs<00:04:32.850> look<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.330> good

chosen weapon like this with the saws in

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.379 
chosen weapon like this with the saws in
the<00:04:54.300> front<00:04:54.630> like<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.470> know<00:04:55.710> saw<00:04:56.520> cutter<00:04:56.790> an

the front like you know saw cutter an

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.940 
the front like you know saw cutter an
instruction<00:04:58.020> book<00:04:58.230> this<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.680> way<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.890> I

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
instruction book this is the way that I

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.200 
instruction book this is the way that I
do<00:04:59.520> it<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:01.110> put<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.500> like<00:05:01.770> this<00:05:01.880> which<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.030> kind

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
do it I put it like this which is kind

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.850 
do it I put it like this which is kind
of<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.390> big<00:05:03.630> claw<00:05:03.930> with<00:05:04.200> solving<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.680> bed

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
of like a big claw with solving the bed

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.640 
of like a big claw with solving the bed
but<00:05:05.520> on<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.760> front<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> cancer<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.169> has

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
but on the front of the cancer it has

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.000 
but on the front of the cancer it has
that<00:05:08.010> but<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.580> has<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.210> flipped<00:05:09.750> around

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
that but it just has this flipped around

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.740 
that but it just has this flipped around
which<00:05:11.010> doesn't<00:05:11.340> really<00:05:11.400> know<00:05:11.730> why<00:05:12.150> they<00:05:12.600> have

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
which doesn't really know why they have

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.900 
which doesn't really know why they have
so<00:05:12.960> many<00:05:13.020> different<00:05:13.380> different<00:05:14.100> pictures<00:05:14.700> and

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
so many different different pictures and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.730 
so many different different pictures and

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
effectively I kind of come to consider

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.150 
effectively I kind of come to consider
next<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.300> thru<00:06:27.600> placement<00:06:27.840> of<00:06:28.289> Duncan<00:06:28.650> bulk<00:06:28.890> so

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
next as thru placement of Duncan bulk so

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.460 
next as thru placement of Duncan bulk so
I<00:06:29.190> brought<00:06:29.280> in<00:06:29.640> dunkin<00:06:29.880> bulk<00:06:30.270> right<00:06:30.750> here<00:06:31.020> you

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
I brought in dunkin bulk right here you

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.040 
I brought in dunkin bulk right here you
can<00:06:31.620> see<00:06:31.830> next<00:06:32.250> is<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.400> good<00:06:33.240> bit<00:06:33.539> taller<00:06:33.840> than

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
can see next is a good bit taller than

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.620 
can see next is a good bit taller than
Duncan<00:06:34.380> bulk<00:06:34.590> and<00:06:34.919> he's<00:06:35.550> done<00:06:35.940> not<00:06:36.150> nearly<00:06:36.479> as

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
Duncan bulk and he's done not nearly as

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.010 
Duncan bulk and he's done not nearly as
bulky

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
bulky

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.110 
bulky
since<00:06:38.199> the<00:06:38.379> name<00:06:38.560> Duncan<00:06:39.039> vote<00:06:39.220> but<00:06:39.940> he's<00:06:40.060> a

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
since the name Duncan vote but he's a

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.460 
since the name Duncan vote but he's a
good<00:06:40.300> bit<00:06:40.479> taller<00:06:40.690> and<00:06:40.990> he<00:06:41.110> has<00:06:41.199> a<00:06:41.229> lot<00:06:41.440> more

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
good bit taller and he has a lot more

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.159 
good bit taller and he has a lot more
pieces<00:06:42.039> and<00:06:42.250> overall<00:06:43.150> a<00:06:43.180> better<00:06:43.539> figure<00:06:43.810> this

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
pieces and overall a better figure this

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.600 
pieces and overall a better figure this
one<00:06:44.379> might<00:06:44.530> look<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.800> little<00:06:45.069> bit<00:06:45.280> better<00:06:45.460> in

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
one might look a little bit better in

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.719 
one might look a little bit better in
some<00:06:45.849> stances<00:06:46.840> but<00:06:47.050> um<00:06:47.199> I<00:06:47.530> think<00:06:48.039> necks<00:06:48.580> is

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
some stances but um I think necks is

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.730 
some stances but um I think necks is
obviously<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.419> better<00:06:49.569> figure<00:06:49.870> so<00:06:50.470> let's<00:06:50.620> go
