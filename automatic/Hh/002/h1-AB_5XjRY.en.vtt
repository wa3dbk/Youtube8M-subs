 here is a group of Jewish girls but 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.390
 is that they made me the door every time 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.710
 that a bit with the camera yes but because 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.890
 they hide because I do not think that they 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.890

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.549

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.970
 when an animal is sacrificed is for the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.440
 request for it to be good harvest for 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.440
