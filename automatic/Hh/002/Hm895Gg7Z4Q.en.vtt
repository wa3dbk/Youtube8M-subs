00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
picked this up at microcenter just now
for<00:00:10.830> eleven<00:00:11.400> hundred<00:00:11.490> dollars<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.719> mine<00:00:13.139> was

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
for eleven hundred dollars but mine was

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.900 
for eleven hundred dollars but mine was
a<00:00:13.290> demo<00:00:13.530> version<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> little

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
a demo version so it was a little

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.620 
a demo version so it was a little
cheaper<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> think<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.940> 13<00:00:17.940> summer

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
