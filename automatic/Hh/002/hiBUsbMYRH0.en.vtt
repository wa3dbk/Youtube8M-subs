welcome<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.010> unboxing<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.580> Corsairs<00:00:09.290> SP<00:00:10.290> or

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
welcome to my unboxing of Corsairs SP or

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.740 
welcome to my unboxing of Corsairs SP or
static<00:00:11.190> pressure<00:00:11.490> series<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.120> fan<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.630> can

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
static pressure series of fan so you can

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.720 
static pressure series of fan so you can
see<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:12.960> got<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> couple<00:00:13.200> dual<00:00:13.650> packs<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
see I've got a couple dual packs here of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000 
see I've got a couple dual packs here of
the<00:00:15.059> high<00:00:15.420> performance<00:00:15.500> Edition<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> the

the high performance Edition and the
quiet<00:00:17.310> Edition<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> only<00:00:18.270> difference

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
quiet Edition now the only difference

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.990 
quiet Edition now the only difference
between<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> high<00:00:19.710> performance<00:00:20.279> Edition<00:00:20.760> fan

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
between a high performance Edition fan

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920 
between a high performance Edition fan
and<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.960> quiet<00:00:22.529> Edition<00:00:23.369> fan<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.330> RP<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and a quiet Edition fan is the RP the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.950 
and a quiet Edition fan is the RP the
stock<00:00:25.199> rpm<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> spins<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.849> 12<00:00:27.510> volts

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
stock rpm at which it spins at 12 volts

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.679 
stock rpm at which it spins at 12 volts
so<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.500> let's<00:00:28.680> go<00:00:28.859> ahead<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.340> now<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.480> talked

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
so here let's go ahead and now I talked

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
so here let's go ahead and now I talked
a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.800> flow<00:00:32.009> series<00:00:32.340> fan

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

to talk about it
where<00:00:37.950> has<00:00:38.250> Corsair<00:00:38.760> innovated<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
where has Corsair innovated when it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
interesting about it so of course there

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
interesting about it so of course there
has<00:00:47.579> done<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> number<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.239> first<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.170> all

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
has done a number of things first of all

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.260 
has done a number of things first of all
they<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.890> gone<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.430> route<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.879> some<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
they have gone the route of some of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
they have gone the route of some of
their<00:00:51.360> competitors<00:00:51.539> who<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.379> different

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
their competitors who have different

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
their competitors who have different
fans<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:53.850> optimized<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.329> different

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
fans that are optimized for different

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
fans that are optimized for different
things<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> Noctua<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.530> example<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.309> their

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
things to Noctua for example has their

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
things to Noctua for example has their
pressure<00:00:56.910> optimized<00:00:57.600> p-series<00:00:58.260> fans<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.949> well

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
pressure optimized p-series fans as well

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
pressure optimized p-series fans as well
as<00:00:59.160> their<00:00:59.520> directed<00:01:00.030> air<00:01:00.149> flow<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> pressure

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
as their directed air flow and pressure

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
as their directed air flow and pressure
optimized<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.590> series<00:01:02.070> fans

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
optimized at series fans

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
optimized at series fans
okay<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.930> Corsair<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.530> SP<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.489> they

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
okay so Corsair has SP and then they

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.870 
okay so Corsair has SP and then they
also<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:06.119> AF<00:01:06.659> series<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.820> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
also have AF series there we go you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
also have AF series there we go you can
see<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.799> different<00:01:11.159> designs

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
see they use very very different designs

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.980 
see they use very very different designs
so<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> ways<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> innovate<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so that's one of the ways to innovate is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
so that's one of the ways to innovate is
you<00:01:13.200> create<00:01:13.530> fans<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.369> properly

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you create fans that are properly

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
you create fans that are properly
optimized<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> different<00:01:16.650> usage

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
optimized for the different usage

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
optimized for the different usage
scenarios<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.150> users<00:01:18.540> will

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
scenarios you think your users will

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
scenarios you think your users will
encounter<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.340> pressure<00:01:20.520> they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
encounter this one for pressure they

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
encounter this one for pressure they
have<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.299> added<00:01:21.630> something<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> think

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
have also added something that I think

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.420 
have also added something that I think
is<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.710> cool<00:01:22.920> too<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is really cool too you just use a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.640 
is really cool too you just use a
screwdriver<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.509> pop<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.990> ring<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
screwdriver to pop the ring off or you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
screwdriver to pop the ring off or you
can<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.369> hands<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> want

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
can do it with your hands if you want

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.640 
can do it with your hands if you want
and<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.900> replace<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.619> red<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.759> white

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
and you can replace it with red or white

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
and you can replace it with red or white
whatever<00:01:31.650> color<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.280> prefer<00:01:32.400> whatever<00:01:32.759> color

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
whatever color you prefer whatever color

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
whatever color you prefer whatever color
you<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.720> accent<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.650> rig<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> best

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you think will accent your rig the best

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
you think will accent your rig the best
I<00:01:35.460> mean<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> hope<00:01:35.790> Corsair<00:01:36.270> comes<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.630> with

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
I mean I hope Corsair comes out with

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.380 
I mean I hope Corsair comes out with
even<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.140> colors<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> future<00:01:37.950> because

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
even more colors in the future because

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210 
even more colors in the future because
that<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.780> looks<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.740> bee's<00:01:40.890> knees

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that just looks like the bee's knees

good at that very clean-looking hobb

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.910 
good at that very clean-looking hobb
designs<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.399> mean<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.670> hate<00:01:54.630> ugly<00:01:55.079> fans<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.619> hate

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.830 
designs I mean I hate ugly fans I hate
good-looking<00:01:56.790> fans<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
good-looking fans that then have like a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
good-looking fans that then have like a
big<00:01:58.229> body<00:01:58.680> sticker<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.850> them

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
big body sticker on the back of them

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
big body sticker on the back of them
just<00:02:00.119> drives<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.049> crazy

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
just drives me crazy

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
just drives me crazy
you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.090> reduce<00:02:03.299> vibration

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you can do that you can reduce vibration

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
you can do that you can reduce vibration
so<00:02:04.350> they've<00:02:04.560> used<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.009> very<00:02:05.280> unique<00:02:05.610> design

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so they've used a very unique design

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.100 
so they've used a very unique design
here<00:02:06.149> where<00:02:06.299> they've<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.570> rubber<00:02:06.810> here

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
here where they've got rubber here

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.660 
here where they've got rubber here
rubber<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.979> rubber<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.310> both<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
rubber here so rubber on both of the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
rubber here so rubber on both of the
outsides<00:02:09.030> rubber<00:02:09.660> filling<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> entire

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
outsides rubber filling in the entire

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370 
outsides rubber filling in the entire
inside<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.760> would<00:02:11.849> normally<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.209> an<00:02:12.390> open

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
inside of what would normally be an open

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
inside of what would normally be an open
open<00:02:13.890> corner<00:02:14.160> fan<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.390> can

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
open corner fan and then but you can

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.540 
open corner fan and then but you can
still<00:02:15.960> access<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.710> insides<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.250> case<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
still access the insides in case you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.740 
still access the insides in case you
need<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.850> run<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> bolt<00:02:18.330> through<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.570> or

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
need to run a bolt through it or

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.660 
need to run a bolt through it or
whatever<00:02:19.020> else<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> case<00:02:19.380> may<00:02:19.680> be<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.310> think

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
whatever else the case may be so I think

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.860 
whatever else the case may be so I think
that's<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.270> cool<00:02:21.450> because<00:02:21.570> they've

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that's really cool because they've

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.480 
that's really cool because they've
reduced<00:02:22.020> vibrations<00:02:22.770> from<00:02:22.860> every<00:02:23.190> possible

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
reduced vibrations from every possible

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.660 
reduced vibrations from every possible
angle<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.450> their<00:02:25.350> add<00:02:25.590> their<00:02:25.770> new<00:02:25.950> series<00:02:26.190> both

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
angle on their add their new series both

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.270 
angle on their add their new series both
syriza's<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.690> fans<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:30.650> think<00:02:31.650> double<00:02:32.070> packs

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
syriza's of fans I think double packs

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.120 
syriza's of fans I think double packs
are<00:02:32.520> actually<00:02:32.880> more<00:02:33.270> cool<00:02:33.510> than<00:02:34.040> people<00:02:35.040> give

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
are actually more cool than people give

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.680 
are actually more cool than people give
them<00:02:35.310> credit<00:02:35.490> for<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.480> save<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
them credit for because you can save a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
them credit for because you can save a
couple<00:02:36.870> bucks<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.530> by<00:02:37.710> getting<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> double

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
couple bucks just by getting a double

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.590 
couple bucks just by getting a double
pack<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.640> quite<00:02:38.790> honestly<00:02:38.910> who<00:02:39.270> needs<00:02:39.450> one

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
pack and quite honestly who needs one

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.300 
pack and quite honestly who needs one
fan<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.020> first<00:02:40.200> place<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.010> let's<00:02:41.190> talk

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
fan in the first place so let's talk

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
fan in the first place so let's talk
about<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> applications<00:02:42.210> what<00:02:42.510> are<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
about the applications what are the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.870 
about the applications what are the
pressure<00:02:42.900> fans<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.460> something

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
pressure fans for if you have something

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.270 
pressure fans for if you have something
like<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.330> case<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> very<00:02:46.320> reflective<00:02:46.680> front

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
like a case with a very reflective front

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940 
like a case with a very reflective front
panel<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.960> don't<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> mesh<00:02:49.710> front

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
panel so if you don't have a mesh front

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.230 
panel so if you don't have a mesh front
panel<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:50.640> something<00:02:51.030> like<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.040> know<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
panel like for something like you know a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.690 
panel like for something like you know a
Corsair<00:02:54.240> 300<00:02:54.960> or<00:02:55.080> where<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:55.470> very<00:02:56.340> open

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
Corsair 300 or where it's very open

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.800 
Corsair 300 or where it's very open
front<00:02:56.940> panel<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.360> something<00:02:57.660> that's

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
front panel you have something that's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.960 
front panel you have something that's
more<00:02:57.960> like<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.140> 650d<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.400> might<00:02:59.580> want<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.820> opt

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
more like a 650d you might want to opt

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
more like a 650d you might want to opt
with<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> pressure<00:03:00.480> series<00:03:00.900> fan<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.830> have

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
with a pressure series fan if you have

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430 
with a pressure series fan if you have
something<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.520> coarser<00:03:03.020> h100<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.260> how

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
something like a coarser h100 see how

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.530 
something like a coarser h100 see how
restrictive<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.430> how<00:03:05.940> little<00:03:06.180> actual

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
restrictive that is how little actual

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
restrictive that is how little actual
space<00:03:06.870> there<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> fan<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.920> push<00:03:08.100> air

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
space there is for the fan to push air

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.370 
space there is for the fan to push air
through<00:03:08.310> well<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.840> were<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.080> use<00:03:10.230> an

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
through well if you were to use an

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.670 
through well if you were to use an
airflow<00:03:10.860> Series<00:03:11.340> fan<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
airflow Series fan it would be and I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.870 
airflow Series fan it would be and I
mean<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.070> okay<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.730> very

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
mean this is okay this is not very

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.760 
mean this is okay this is not very
technical<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.780> very<00:03:15.960> surface<00:03:16.380> okay

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
technical this is like very surface okay

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.210 
technical this is like very surface okay
guys<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.370> would<00:03:17.670> be<00:03:17.900> very<00:03:18.900> leaky<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.740> speak

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
guys it would be very leaky so to speak

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.890 
guys it would be very leaky so to speak
so<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.610> would<00:03:20.760> try<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.000> push<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.450> air<00:03:21.540> through

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
so it would try to push the air through

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.550 
so it would try to push the air through
try<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.440> use<00:03:22.770> these<00:03:22.980> very<00:03:23.610> scoopy<00:03:24.360> very<00:03:24.930> flat

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
try to use these very scoopy very flat

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.580 
try to use these very scoopy very flat
propeller<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.550> blades<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.570> push<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.410> air

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
propeller like blades to push the air

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.640 
propeller like blades to push the air
through<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.630> would<00:03:30.750> leak<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.380> would

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
through it but it would leak it would

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.680 
through it but it would leak it would
spit<00:03:32.160> air<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.940> through<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.210> fan<00:03:33.480> which

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
spit air back up through the fan which

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.200 
spit air back up through the fan which
reduces<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.260> efficiency<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.100> reduces<00:03:36.030> how

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
reduces the efficiency and reduces how

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.030 
reduces the efficiency and reduces how
much<00:03:36.360> airflow<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.720> actually<00:03:37.230> get<00:03:37.500> through

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
much airflow you actually get through

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.610 
much airflow you actually get through
your<00:03:38.220> radiator<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.880> fan<00:03:39.270> noise<00:03:39.750> basically

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
your radiator and fan noise basically

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.100 
your radiator and fan noise basically
goes<00:03:40.950> up<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.430> linear<00:03:41.670> fashion<00:03:42.120> with<00:03:42.630> our<00:03:42.660> PM

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
goes up in a linear fashion with our PM

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.500 
goes up in a linear fashion with our PM
the<00:03:43.590> faster<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.100> spin<00:03:44.250> your<00:03:44.490> fan<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.300> louder

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
the faster you spin your fan the louder

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.630 
the faster you spin your fan the louder
it<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.530> have<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.890> waste<00:03:47.160> cycles

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
it is so if you have to waste cycles

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.580 
it is so if you have to waste cycles
spinning<00:03:48.330> faster<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.870> order<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.140> push<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.470> air

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
spinning faster in order to push the air

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.660 
spinning faster in order to push the air
through<00:03:49.860> you're<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.640> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
through you're just going to have a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.700 
through you're just going to have a
noisier<00:03:51.120> experience<00:03:51.720> whereas<00:03:52.320> with<00:03:52.530> their

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
noisier experience whereas with their

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.010 
noisier experience whereas with their
pressure<00:03:53.070> series<00:03:53.610> fans<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.600> see<00:03:54.840> they

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
pressure series fans you can see they

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.480 
pressure series fans you can see they
have<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.410> much<00:03:55.860> broader<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:57.290> lower<00:03:58.490> lower

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
have a much broader and lower lower

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.270 
have a much broader and lower lower
count<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.510> propeller<00:04:00.900> blades<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.920> what

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
count of the propeller blades so what

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920 
count of the propeller blades so what
that<00:04:02.460> means<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.420> they<00:04:03.570> spin

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
that means is that when they spin

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.960 
that means is that when they spin
they're<00:04:04.320> more<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.890> constant<00:04:05.610> downward

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
they're more of a constant downward

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.660 
they're more of a constant downward
pressure<00:04:06.570> as<00:04:06.870> opposed<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.770> moving<00:04:08.340> through<00:04:08.520> as

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
pressure as opposed to moving through as

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.460 
pressure as opposed to moving through as
much<00:04:08.850> air<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.450> they<00:04:09.780> were<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.110> completely

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
much air if they were in a completely

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.250 
much air if they were in a completely
open<00:04:10.590> environment<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.520> this<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.840> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
open environment like this so that is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.789 
open environment like this so that is
why<00:04:13.800> these<00:04:13.860> are<00:04:14.220> optimized<00:04:14.670> for<00:04:14.880> high<00:04:15.799> high

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
why these are optimized for high high

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.010 
why these are optimized for high high
pressure<00:04:17.180> applications<00:04:18.180> such<00:04:18.390> as<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:18.750> where

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
pressure applications such as this where

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.900 
pressure applications such as this where
there's<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.230> lot<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.799> restriction<00:04:20.760> or

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
there's a lot of restriction or

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.330 
there's a lot of restriction or
resistance<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.989> flow<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.200> air<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.190> there

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
resistance to the flow of air so there

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.040 
resistance to the flow of air so there
you<00:04:23.430> go<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.210> why<00:04:24.600> there<00:04:24.810> are<00:04:24.930> two

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
you go that is why there are two

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.560 
you go that is why there are two
