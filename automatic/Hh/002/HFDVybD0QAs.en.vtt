so confusing
now<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> next<00:00:45.480> step<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.260> set<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
now the next step would be to set the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.569 
now the next step would be to set the
document<00:00:47.579> size<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.510> frame<00:00:48.960> rates<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.309> can

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
document size and frame rates so you can

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
document size and frame rates so you can
double<00:00:51.570> click<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.930> frame<00:00:52.289> rate<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
double click here on frame rate and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.729 
double click here on frame rate and
it'll<00:00:53.070> pop<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.300> click<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.750> modify

document<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:57.770> work<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.949> 1/2<00:00:59.160> HD<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> 960

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
document I work at 1/2 HD which is 960

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
document I work at 1/2 HD which is 960
by<00:01:01.170> 540<00:01:01.789> everything<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.879> HD<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.359> everything

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
by 540 everything is HD now everything

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.070 
by 540 everything is HD now everything
is<00:01:03.840> 1920<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.710> 1080<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> 16:9<00:01:07.229> proportions<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
is 1920 by 1080 the 16:9 proportions so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
is 1920 by 1080 the 16:9 proportions so
working<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.320> half<00:01:11.240> makes<00:01:12.240> everything<00:01:12.540> really

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
working at half makes everything really

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.520 
working at half makes everything really
easy<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.710> flash<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.280> handle<00:01:15.320> every<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
easy for flash to handle every time I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.580 
easy for flash to handle every time I
work<00:01:16.710> higher<00:01:17.310> sizes<00:01:18.030> than<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> flash<00:01:19.259> freaks

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
work higher sizes than this flash freaks

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
work higher sizes than this flash freaks
out<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> crashes<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.820> any

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
out and crashes but I don't get any

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
out and crashes but I don't get any
crashes<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.540> problems<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> work<00:01:22.430> at<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
crashes or problems when I work at this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.410 
crashes or problems when I work at this
size<00:01:24.290> frame<00:01:25.290> rate<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.710> typically<00:01:26.700> either<00:01:26.970> 12

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
size frame rate is typically either 12

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
size frame rate is typically either 12
or<00:01:27.630> 24

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
or 24

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
or 24
I<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.970> animating<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.720> 24<00:01:31.200> frames<00:01:31.259> per<00:01:31.470> second

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I like animating at 24 frames per second

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.649 
I like animating at 24 frames per second
that's<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.369> mean<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.549> every<00:01:33.090> Disney<00:01:33.329> movie

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that's I mean that's every Disney movie

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's I mean that's every Disney movie
you've<00:01:33.810> ever<00:01:33.840> seen<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.799> animation<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you've ever seen that's in animation is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
you've ever seen that's in animation is
pretty<00:01:36.540> much<00:01:36.600> always<00:01:36.840> 24<00:01:37.380> frames<00:01:37.560> per<00:01:37.680> second

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
pretty much always 24 frames per second

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
pretty much always 24 frames per second
so<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.909> good<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> comfortable<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.780> 24

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so it's good to get comfortable with 24

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
so it's good to get comfortable with 24
you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> also<00:01:41.280> set<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.700> 12<00:01:42.049> that's<00:01:43.049> totally

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you can also set it to 12 that's totally

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
you can also set it to 12 that's totally
fine<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.799> half<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.490> half<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.759> frame

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fine that's half that's half the frame

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.969 
fine that's half that's half the frame
rate<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:46.049> probably<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
rate you're probably not going to be you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
rate you're probably not going to be you
know<00:01:47.100> animating<00:01:48.200> everything<00:01:49.200> ever<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.740> know

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
know animating everything ever you know

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.039 
know animating everything ever you know
24<00:01:50.310> new<00:01:50.610> drawings<00:01:51.030> per<00:01:51.180> second<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.720> putting<00:01:51.960> on

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
24 new drawings per second so putting on

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
24 new drawings per second so putting on
at<00:01:52.140> 12<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> totally<00:01:52.920> fine<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.310> might<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.490> easier

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
at 12 is totally fine it might be easier

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.620 
at 12 is totally fine it might be easier
if<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.979> you're<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.189> learning<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.790> that's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
if you're you're just learning so that's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.819 
if you're you're just learning so that's
