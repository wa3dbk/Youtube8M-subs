in a garden so we get a lot of questions

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.900 
in a garden so we get a lot of questions
about<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.500> effectively<00:00:11.190> reduce<00:00:11.670> size

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about how do we effectively reduce size

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.850 
about how do we effectively reduce size
of<00:00:12.179> roses<00:00:12.599> how<00:00:12.719> far<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.139> cut<00:00:13.349> them<00:00:13.440> back<00:00:13.620> how

you<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> good<00:00:23.070> clean<00:00:23.400> cut<00:00:23.730> better<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you a good clean cut better for the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.750 
you a good clean cut better for the
plant<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.220> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> speeds<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> process

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
plant and kind of speeds up the process

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.700 
plant and kind of speeds up the process
a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.900> might<00:00:27.930> also<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.560> some

of<00:00:30.900> pruners<00:00:31.109> basically<00:00:31.710> gives<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> little

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
of pruners basically gives you a little

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
of pruners basically gives you a little
more<00:00:32.640> leverage<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.210> bigger<00:00:33.390> branches<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
more leverage for bigger branches and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.049 
more leverage for bigger branches and
keeps<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.130> having<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> reach<00:00:35.700> down<00:00:35.880> in

keeps you from having to reach down in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
keeps you from having to reach down in
the<00:00:36.120> plant<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.770> might<00:00:37.920> also

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the plant so much and you might also

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
the plant so much and you might also
want<00:00:38.460> some<00:00:38.610> leather<00:00:38.790> gloves<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.420> these

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
want some leather gloves because these

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
thorns I'm a bit hard-headed some of my

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
thorns I'm a bit hard-headed some of my
wearing<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:43.620> today<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.239> definitely<00:00:45.239> try

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
those out now we're going to talk about

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
those out now we're going to talk about
two<00:00:47.670> pruning<00:00:48.090> methods<00:00:48.420> heading<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
two pruning methods heading back is the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.720 
two pruning methods heading back is the
first<00:00:49.800> method<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> talk<00:00:50.550> about

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
first method we're going to talk about

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
first method we're going to talk about
and<00:00:51.210> heading<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> basically

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and heading back you can basically

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910 
and heading back you can basically
reduce<00:00:53.399> size<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> third<00:00:54.800> we're<00:00:55.800> also

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
reduce size by about a third we're also

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
reduce size by about a third we're also
going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> talk<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.489> rejuvenation<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
going to talk about rejuvenation and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
going to talk about rejuvenation and
what's<00:00:58.020> such<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> shortly<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.370> with

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
what's such on that shortly but with

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
what's such on that shortly but with
heading<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> take

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
heading back what you want to do is take

your hand pruners go into a bud and just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.590 
your hand pruners go into a bud and just
prune<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.309> above<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.640> bud<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.240> you're

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
prune right above that bud now you're

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.260 
prune right above that bud now you're
going<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> third<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> plant

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
going up to about a third of the plant

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
going up to about a third of the plant
just<00:01:09.270> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.830> follow<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.250> distance

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
just kind of follow that same distance

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
just kind of follow that same distance
all<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.560> tell<00:01:13.740> we're

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
all the way back in you can tell we're

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.990 
all the way back in you can tell we're
just<00:01:14.070> following<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.549> bud<00:01:14.760> line<00:01:14.970> there<00:01:15.710> and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
just following the bud line there and

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590 
just following the bud line there and
effectively<00:01:18.000> reducing<00:01:18.900> size<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> do

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
effectively reducing size you can do

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
effectively reducing size you can do
that<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> plant<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.189> want

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that all over the plant if you just want

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390 
that all over the plant if you just want
to<00:01:23.490> prune<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.619> now<00:01:25.619> my

going to take the loppers and I'm going
to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.700> towards<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> base<00:01:39.770> being<00:01:40.770> kind<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to go in towards the base being kind of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.200 
to go in towards the base being kind of
careful<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> lot<00:01:42.180> of
