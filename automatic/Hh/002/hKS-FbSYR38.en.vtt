00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.060 
you see on it is removed once you do
that<00:02:18.830> then<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.080> next<00:02:21.110> part<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
that then the the next part is the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.400 
that then the the next part is the
tougher<00:02:22.460> one<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.090> actually<00:02:23.270> clean<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
tougher one is to actually clean the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980 
tougher one is to actually clean the
rubber<00:02:24.730> rings<00:02:25.730> right<00:02:25.970> here<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.480> zoom<00:02:26.750> and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
rubber rings right here for zoom and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.220 
rubber rings right here for zoom and
focus<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.940> I've<00:02:28.940> tried<00:02:29.300> different<00:02:29.750> solutions

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
focus and I've tried different solutions

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.780 
focus and I've tried different solutions
different<00:02:30.590> brushes<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.130> believe<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.610> or<00:02:31.670> not

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
different brushes and believe it or not

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.200 
different brushes and believe it or not
the<00:02:32.600> best<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.350> found<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.860> date<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
the best one that I found to date is a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.530 
the best one that I found to date is a
toothbrush<00:02:35.840> especially<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.770> hard<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.370> if<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
toothbrush especially a hard one if you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.810 
can just go to a local grocery store and
grab<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.510> hard<00:02:41.900> brush<00:02:42.220> believe<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.550> it

grab a hard brush believe it or not it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.699 
grab a hard brush believe it or not it
will<00:02:44.030> work<00:02:44.330> great<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.370> for

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
will work great so I just do this for

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.420 
will work great so I just do this for
both<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.190> focus<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.300> zoom<00:02:50.510> ring<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.430> it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
both the focus and the zoom ring and it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.600 
both the focus and the zoom ring and it
cleans<00:02:53.209> most<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> stuff<00:02:54.110> out<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:55.190> really

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
cleans most of the stuff out it's really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.440 
cleans most of the stuff out it's really
amazing<00:02:56.380> simple<00:02:57.380> stuff<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.680> works<00:02:58.450> anyway

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
amazing simple stuff that works anyway

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.440 
amazing simple stuff that works anyway
once<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.750> do<00:02:59.930> that<00:02:59.959> then<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.920> would<00:03:01.450> then

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
once you do that then I would then

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.920 
once you do that then I would then
extend<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.200> barrel<00:03:03.530> all<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.920> way<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.420> 24

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
extend the barrel all the way on the 24

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.770 
extend the barrel all the way on the 24
72<00:03:06.350> 24<00:03:06.830> millimeters<00:03:07.490> where<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.850> front<00:03:08.150> part

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
72 24 millimeters where the front part

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.320 
72 24 millimeters where the front part
of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.990> lens<00:03:09.170> extends<00:03:09.740> up<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.459> then

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
of the lens extends up like that then

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.530 
of the lens extends up like that then
again<00:03:12.080> apply<00:03:12.650> some<00:03:12.890> solution<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.580> with<00:03:14.390> it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.720 
we're going to actually clean the the
lens<00:04:40.490> mount<00:04:40.960> just<00:04:41.960> like<00:04:42.110> that<00:04:45.100> okay<00:04:46.600> Wow

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
lens mount just like that okay Wow

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.000 
lens mount just like that okay Wow
the<00:04:49.730> final<00:04:50.120> step<00:04:50.390> is<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.660> clean<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.350> contacts

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
the final step is to clean the contacts

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.350 
the final step is to clean the contacts
on<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:53.060> lens<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.600> that's<00:04:54.590> what<00:04:54.770> actually

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
on the lens and that's what actually

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.690 
on the lens and that's what actually
sends<00:04:56.360> information<00:04:56.990> from<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.920> lens<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.460> the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
sends information from the lens to the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.940 
sends information from the lens to the
camera<00:04:59.150> body<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.660> it's<00:05:00.530> these<00:05:01.960> middle<00:05:02.960> round

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
camera body and it's these middle round

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.540 
camera body and it's these middle round
contacts<00:05:04.610> right<00:05:04.850> here<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:06.370> also<00:05:07.370> don't

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
contacts right here and also don't

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.090 
contacts right here and also don't
forget<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:08.200> clean<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.260> wall<00:05:10.040> around<00:05:11.950> there<00:05:12.950> we

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
forget to clean the wall around there we

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.160 
forget to clean the wall around there we
go<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.760> mount<00:05:14.000> is<00:05:14.180> now<00:05:14.300> clean<00:05:14.920> now<00:05:17.170> don't

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
go the mount is now clean now don't

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.880 
go the mount is now clean now don't
forget<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.530> clean<00:05:18.860> this<00:05:19.070> too<00:05:19.840> before<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.650> put

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
forget to clean this too before you put

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.430 
forget to clean this too before you put
it<00:05:21.980> back<00:05:22.010> on<00:05:22.930> okay

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.210 

the<00:05:27.440> next<00:05:27.890> task<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:29.500> if<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.680> have<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.890> filter

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
the next task is to if you have a filter

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.700 
the next task is to if you have a filter
just<00:05:31.730> clean<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.210> filter<00:05:32.570> if<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:33.170> don't<00:05:33.470> have

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
just clean the filter if you don't have

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.270 
just clean the filter if you don't have
a<00:05:33.740> filter<00:05:34.060> then<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.440> can<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:36.950> can<00:05:37.070> see<00:05:37.250> that

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
a filter then and I can you can see that

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.760 
a filter then and I can you can see that
I<00:05:37.400> have<00:05:37.640> a<00:05:37.670> polarizing<00:05:38.540> filter<00:05:38.990> on<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.560> lens

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
I have a polarizing filter on the lens

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.120 
I have a polarizing filter on the lens
then<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:40.970> first<00:05:41.720> inspect<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.800> front

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
then just first inspect the front

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.960 
then just first inspect the front
element<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:44.440> slow<00:05:45.440> off<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.680> dust<00:05:46.130> if<00:05:46.430> it

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
element and slow off the dust if it

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.180 
element and slow off the dust if it
looks<00:05:47.210> clean<00:05:47.540> if<00:05:47.810> you<00:05:48.440> don't<00:05:48.620> have<00:05:48.860> to<00:05:49.010> clean

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
looks clean if you don't have to clean

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.910 
looks clean if you don't have to clean
then<00:05:49.730> don't<00:05:50.030> think<00:05:50.210> if<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.080> do<00:05:51.290> have<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.680> clean

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
then don't think if you do have to clean

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.210 
then don't think if you do have to clean
then<00:05:52.670> my<00:05:53.570> solution<00:05:54.260> is<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.790> use<00:05:56.980> the<00:05:57.980> lens

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
then my solution is to use the lens

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.780 
then my solution is to use the lens
cleaning<00:05:58.580> paper<00:05:59.920> microfiber<00:06:00.920> cloth<00:06:01.310> can<00:06:01.640> be

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
cleaning paper microfiber cloth can be

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.950 
cleaning paper microfiber cloth can be
great<00:06:02.120> but<00:06:02.720> it<00:06:03.350> often<00:06:03.890> leaves<00:06:04.130> stuff<00:06:04.580> on<00:06:04.960> the

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
great but it often leaves stuff on the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.100 
great but it often leaves stuff on the
front<00:06:06.230> element<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.040> which<00:06:07.490> is<00:06:07.720> even<00:06:08.720> tougher

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
front element and which is even tougher

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.700 
front element and which is even tougher
to<00:06:09.140> remove<00:06:09.650> with<00:06:09.890> the<00:06:10.040> blower<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.480> find<00:06:12.410> the

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
to remove with the blower so I find the

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.580 
to remove with the blower so I find the
lens<00:06:13.100> cleaning<00:06:13.490> paper<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:14.120> work<00:06:14.240> best<00:06:14.720> what<00:06:15.560> I

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
lens cleaning paper to work best what I

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.100 
lens cleaning paper to work best what I
do<00:06:15.740> is<00:06:16.160> just<00:06:16.600> use<00:06:17.600> one<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:17.870> these<00:06:19.000> apply<00:06:20.000> just<00:06:20.990> a

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
do is just use one of these apply just a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.290 
do is just use one of these apply just a
little<00:06:21.140> bit<00:06:21.380> of<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.650> solution<00:06:22.100> and<00:06:22.250> then<00:06:23.000> just

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
little bit of the solution and then just

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.520 
little bit of the solution and then just
wipe<00:06:23.930> it<00:06:25.120> in<00:06:26.120> a<00:06:26.180> circular<00:06:26.600> motion<00:06:26.930> either

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
wipe it in a circular motion either

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.560 
wipe it in a circular motion either
clockwise<00:06:27.830> or<00:06:28.100> counter<00:06:28.760> clockwise<00:06:28.790> until

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
clockwise or counter clockwise until

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.130 
clockwise or counter clockwise until
it's<00:06:30.110> clean<00:06:30.350> then<00:06:31.070> once<00:06:31.700> it's<00:06:31.880> clean<00:06:32.140> just

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
it's clean then once it's clean just

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.930 
it's clean then once it's clean just
flow<00:06:33.350> off<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.650> rest<00:06:34.220> of<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.460> stuff<00:06:34.700> that

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
flow off the rest of the stuff that

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.600 
flow off the rest of the stuff that
might<00:06:35.150> be<00:06:35.300> there<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.960> I'm<00:06:36.470> ready<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:36.800> go<00:06:36.920> I<00:06:37.160> can

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
might be there and I'm ready to go I can

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.950 
might be there and I'm ready to go I can
put<00:06:37.880> the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
put the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.070 
put the
cap<00:06:40.320> back<00:06:40.590> on<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.100> I'm<00:06:42.000> done<00:06:42.210> now<00:06:42.479> let's<00:06:42.900> talk

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
cap back on and I'm done now let's talk

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.040 
cap back on and I'm done now let's talk
about<00:06:43.139> cleaning<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.220> rear<00:06:44.729> lens<00:06:45.479> element

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
about cleaning the rear lens element

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.140 
about cleaning the rear lens element
this<00:06:46.889> is<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.190> part<00:06:47.460> where<00:06:47.639> you<00:06:47.729> have<00:06:47.880> to<00:06:48.030> be<00:06:48.120> a

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
this is the part where you have to be a

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.230 
this is the part where you have to be a
little<00:06:48.240> bit<00:06:48.449> careful<00:06:48.600> because<00:06:48.889> there<00:06:49.889> are

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
little bit careful because there are

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.930 
little bit careful because there are
metal<00:06:51.240> pieces<00:06:51.630> here<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:52.259> it<00:06:53.220> sometimes<00:06:53.580> can

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
metal pieces here and it sometimes can

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.129 
metal pieces here and it sometimes can
get<00:06:54.120> difficult<00:06:54.720> to<00:06:55.729> clean<00:06:56.729> the<00:06:57.180> rear<00:06:57.810> lens

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
get difficult to clean the rear lens

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.689 
get difficult to clean the rear lens
mount<00:06:58.440> so<00:06:59.160> again<00:07:00.000> use<00:07:00.810> the<00:07:01.259> same<00:07:01.699> lens

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
mount so again use the same lens

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.969 
mount so again use the same lens
cleaning<00:07:03.060> paper<00:07:03.389> and<00:07:03.770> obviously<00:07:04.770> use<00:07:04.949> a

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
cleaning paper and obviously use a

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.469 
cleaning paper and obviously use a
different<00:07:05.460> one<00:07:05.669> than<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:05.970> one<00:07:06.000> that<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.360> use

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 
different one than the one that you use

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.110 
different one than the one that you use
on<00:07:06.690> the<00:07:06.720> front<00:07:07.050> just<00:07:07.350> to<00:07:07.470> make<00:07:07.650> sure<00:07:07.860> that<00:07:08.130> it's

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
on the front just to make sure that it's

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.200 
on the front just to make sure that it's
all<00:07:09.330> clean<00:07:09.660> and<00:07:09.930> then<00:07:10.470> use<00:07:11.100> the<00:07:11.250> same<00:07:11.520> method

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
all clean and then use the same method

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.290 
all clean and then use the same method
of<00:07:12.330> applying<00:07:12.990> some<00:07:13.639> solution<00:07:14.639> and<00:07:14.820> just

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
of applying some solution and just

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.930 
of applying some solution and just
gently<00:07:15.599> wiping<00:07:16.229> it<00:07:16.410> either<00:07:16.860> clockwise<00:07:17.400> or

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
gently wiping it either clockwise or
