 so be the most elementary 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.680
 requires specialized technical guidance

 five to six months to gain experience 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.030
 in addition to an official

 that attends with a look without food 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.970
 the terrain of being clear not having drafts 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.050
 it is necessary that it touch in the high part with the purpose that in rainy season it is not 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 present floods 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.509
 the facilities are simple and economical 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 Enough 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 with which they meet conditions that provide security and comfort

 during the afternoons sanitary is the most important of the entire process 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.549
 that the good development of the offices will depend on it 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.249
 periodic fumigations and disinfection 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.899

 are meticulously designed equipment that meet environmental conditions of 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.630
 humidity and movement temperature automatically controlled and allow 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.630
