 Maria Elena will fetch water once more 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.070
 in this community in the desert at 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.260
 northwest of Colombia as in many 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 other parts of the world the provision of 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.780
 water for the family is a task for 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.210
 women 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.880

 crossing the suffocating sands until 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.400
 the tap of the town but the water that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.140
 it comes out of it is salty 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.730
 it's water from the earth but it was drilled 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.730
 so here is the salty water 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 griselda polanco is the niece of maría 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.680
 Elena and one of the leaders of her 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.140
 community 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.660
 are part of the largest indigenous group in 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.820
 Colombia the Wayuu whose ancestral 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.860
 lands next to the venezuela border 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.220
 they are suffering the consequences 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.080
 devastating climate change that 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 this was a rich land was a land 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.219
 it was raining it was a cool earth 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 but now not five years for each 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:21.500
 a terrible followed last year was 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.500
 a year that we live without any rain 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.260
 as a result of this the traditional 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.990
 water reserves Wayuu or Hawaii 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.000
 are drying up if there are still people who 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.610
 they take that green water that is no longer 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.590
 a sad because there is no way to take 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.270
 causes harm every time we do 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.270

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.909
 that about children has this situation 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.729

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.830
 matrilineal as the uai are those that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.470

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.530
 in spite of everything and practically to simple 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 sight leave their homes in their lands 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.550
 there is an abundant water source 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
 cool to which neither griselda nor its 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.630
 family or neighbors of Pessoa town 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.630
 for they have access 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.900
 the water they draw from here 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.849
 indigenous communities 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.310
 those are for the benefit of the people 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.310
 of the people they are are not indigenous 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.400
 Griselda has been campaigning for years 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.650
 favor of the right of his people to this 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.780
 water is facing a team of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.939
 engineers that works in the place and 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.590
 demands that they give their water a little 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.049
 community that will know who the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.549
 contractor of this to be able to converse 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.099
 with him or if we do not go to 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.030
 paralyze the work and at the time the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.030
 50 songs 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.900
 this fight for the right to their resources 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.330
 natural has reached the highest level 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.370
 in 2006 the sister of griselda orsinia 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.140
 Polanco became the first woman 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.260
 chosen to integrate the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.209
 Colombian congress in Bogotá repeated 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.159
 has sometimes struggled to get it 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.349
 sanctions a law that recognizes the 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.019
 fundamental right of all 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.079
 Colombians on the water one of my biggest 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.910
 dreams that I always fought and I've 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.430
 discussed is that 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.730
 that there is water for the Wayúu people 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.100
 it's the first thing I want but the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.200
 project that he presented in 2009 failed 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.360
 become law and she feels that the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.460
 state has not protected its people and its 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.150
 right to the natural resources that they 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.150
 belong 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.050
 the manager of the program in colombia del 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.240
 un development fund for the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.100
 woman daisy bueso holds that the 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.440
 rights of the Wayúu people to the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.660
 basic needs of life should 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.940
 protect yourself 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.620
 the state has a great responsibility 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.390
 in supporting that these indigenous peoples 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.600
 preserve their culture and if the woman is 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.170
 fundamental I think we should move forward in 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.920
 the right in access to justice and 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:31.400
 in guaranteeing basic needs 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.740
 with water we will be able to plant 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.009
 and when we sow we will be able to 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.699
 feed us well the truth the future what 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:43.280
 let's get if we get the royalty 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.139
 of water and if we achieve it with this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.979
 community we can achieve it with other 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.979
 more communities
