materials I recommend having okay this
is<00:00:15.179> where<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.509> left<00:00:15.630> off<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.139> last<00:00:16.230> video

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
is where we left off in the last video

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
is where we left off in the last video
as<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.640> mentioned<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.300> add<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.630> more

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
as I mentioned you can add a lot more

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
as I mentioned you can add a lot more
detail<00:00:19.260> before<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.710> clay<00:00:19.890> dries<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.580> for

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
detail before the clay dries but for

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.700 
detail before the clay dries but for
something<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.779> prefer<00:00:22.289> letting<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
something like this I prefer letting the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.220 
something like this I prefer letting the
clay<00:00:22.920> dry<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> sturdy<00:00:24.029> base

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.140 

there<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> few<00:00:28.470> ways<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.919> can<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
there are a few ways you can do this you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
there are a few ways you can do this you
can<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.630> needle<00:00:30.720> tool<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> just

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
can take your needle tool and just

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
can take your needle tool and just
engrave<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:31.980> details<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.449> one

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
engrave the details which i think is one

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
engrave the details which i think is one
of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> most<00:00:34.020> common<00:00:34.350> methods<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.949> probably

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
of the most common methods and probably

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.759 
of the most common methods and probably
also<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> easiest<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
also the easiest way is just going to

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.590 
also the easiest way is just going to
engrave<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> word<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.670> name<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> small<00:00:39.360> pattern

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
engrave a word a name or a small pattern

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.410 
engrave a word a name or a small pattern
but<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> mentioned<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.699> other<00:00:41.730> video<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
but as I mentioned in the other video I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.960 
but as I mentioned in the other video I
found<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.140> dried<00:00:43.890> bronze<00:00:44.190> clay<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.519> be<00:00:44.730> hotter

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
found the dried bronze clay to be hotter

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.389 
found the dried bronze clay to be hotter
and<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.390> durable<00:00:45.870> than<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.229> silver<00:00:46.500> clay<00:00:46.829> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and more durable than the silver clay so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
and more durable than the silver clay so
it<00:00:47.430> takes<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.729> bit<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:47.909> effort<00:00:51.440> another<00:00:52.440> thing

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it takes a bit more effort another thing

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
it takes a bit more effort another thing
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.159> is<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> brush<00:00:54.089> on<00:00:54.269> some

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you can do is to just brush on some

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.899 
you can do is to just brush on some
water<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.989> soften<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.530> surface<00:00:55.979> then<00:00:56.640> just

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
water to soften the surface then just

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.579 
water to soften the surface then just
wait<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.329> couple<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> minutes<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> this

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
wait for a couple of minutes and this

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.020 
wait for a couple of minutes and this
will<00:00:58.799> make<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> easier<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.369> engrave<00:00:59.790> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
will make it easier to engrave and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
will make it easier to engrave and
sculpt<00:01:00.330> using<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.839> needle<00:01:01.140> tool<00:01:03.049> but<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.229> was

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
sculpt using the needle tool but I was

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
sculpt using the needle tool but I was
going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:04.979> quite<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.549> engrave

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
going to make quite a lot of engrave

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
going to make quite a lot of engrave
details<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:06.689> bird<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.259> decided<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
details from this bird so I decided to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
details from this bird so I decided to
try<00:01:08.220> finding<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.000> easier<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> faster<00:01:09.720> way<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
try finding an easier and faster way of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.210 
try finding an easier and faster way of
doing<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:12.170> before<00:01:13.170> starting<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.829> any<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
doing this before starting on any of the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.069 
doing this before starting on any of the
details<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> bird<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
details so I went over the bird with a

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.469 
details so I went over the bird with a
sanding<00:01:16.530> sponge<00:01:16.790> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
sanding sponge this is just going to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
sanding sponge this is just going to
smooth<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> surface<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.740> rid<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
smooth out the surface and get rid of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:44.960 
smooth out the surface and get rid of
any<00:01:20.250> rough<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.759> uneven<00:01:20.970> areas

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.550 

the<00:01:45.970> cool<00:01:46.210> thing<00:01:46.509> is<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.689> even<00:01:47.290> though<00:01:47.439> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
the cool thing is that even though the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.620 
the cool thing is that even though the
play<00:01:47.830> hasn't<00:01:48.220> been<00:01:48.340> fired<00:01:48.549> yet<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.299> can<00:01:49.450> see

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
play hasn't been fired yet you can see

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.240 
play hasn't been fired yet you can see
the<00:01:49.780> metal<00:01:50.049> particles<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.009> start

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
the metal particles when you start

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:11.000 
the metal particles when you start
sanding<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.789> polishing<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.420> dried<00:01:52.659> clay<00:01:52.960> I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.620 

decided<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.220> try<00:02:12.400> using<00:02:12.700> my<00:02:12.819> multi<00:02:13.180> polishing

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
decided to try using my multi polishing

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.320 
decided to try using my multi polishing
machine<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.200> details<00:02:14.760> another<00:02:15.760> option

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
machine for the details another option

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300 
machine for the details another option
would<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.989> Dremel<00:02:17.440> engraver<00:02:17.890> or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
would be the Dremel engraver or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
would be the Dremel engraver or
something<00:02:18.730> similar<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.690> main<00:02:19.720> difference<00:02:20.350> is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
something similar the main difference is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
something similar the main difference is
that<00:02:20.560> mine<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.519> big<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.060> probably<00:02:22.780> not

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that mine is pretty big and probably not

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.840 
that mine is pretty big and probably not
as<00:02:23.080> easy<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.410> handle<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:24.100> most<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> more

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850

the<00:06:40.160> only<00:06:40.280> problem<00:06:40.820> I<00:06:40.880> found<00:06:41.060> though<00:06:41.330> is<00:06:41.360> that

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
the only problem I found though is that

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.320 
the only problem I found though is that
because<00:06:42.590> this<00:06:42.919> is<00:06:42.980> a<00:06:43.130> miniature<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.150> has<00:06:44.300> a

because this is a miniature and it has a

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.570

lot<00:06:44.570> of<00:06:44.600> small<00:06:44.750> details<00:06:45.050> I<00:06:45.650> couldn't<00:06:46.280> get<00:06:46.430> into

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
lot of small details I couldn't get into

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.640

all<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.030> little<00:06:47.060> crevices<00:06:47.510> with<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.290> machine

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
all the little crevices with the machine

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.980 
all the little crevices with the machine
so<00:06:49.040> I<00:06:49.280> had<00:06:49.790> to<00:06:49.940> go<00:06:50.060> with<00:06:50.270> some<00:06:50.419> of<00:06:50.540> the<00:06:50.660> areas

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
so I had to go with some of the areas

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.810 
so I had to go with some of the areas
with<00:06:51.200> the<00:06:51.320> needle<00:06:51.590> tools<00:06:51.860> but<00:06:52.160> it<00:06:52.310> wasn't<00:06:52.700> big

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
with the needle tools but it wasn't big

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.680
