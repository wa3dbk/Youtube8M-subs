00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
which I guess kind of goes a little bit

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.759 
which I guess kind of goes a little bit
better<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> evil<00:00:21.960> classes<00:00:22.500> at

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
better with the evil classes at

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.950 
better with the evil classes at

grows fifteen percent faster and now

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.179 
grows fifteen percent faster and now
it's<00:00:27.900> easy<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> assume<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.039> very
