00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 I will explain 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.600

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 But this too 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.250
 It 's so fast that you can do it with your right hand alone 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:24.670
 Well that's right 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:28.740

 At last I could take it into here but I would like to make the bill so much love and freedom 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 It is a feeling 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.040

 It looks like this is a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.990
 It is a very simple pattern of the entrance of Bossa Nova 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 It is a nation, and it is a very common power net 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.810
