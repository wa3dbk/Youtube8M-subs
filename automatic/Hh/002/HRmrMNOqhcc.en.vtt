00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.980
 Jos actually the two people who own it 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.390
 most just scored have that question too 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370
 Jan Sjouke was presented a bit 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.409
 it surprises you that you didn't play in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.600

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.539
 little known just which ladies by 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.800

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.460

 for sure but you feel that right 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.449
 because you don't score the most 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.670
