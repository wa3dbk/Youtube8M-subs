it's<00:00:26.140> going<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.289> be<00:00:26.380> full<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.100> refined<00:00:27.850> sugar

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
it's going to be full of refined sugar

well<00:00:28.570> here's<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:28.960> version<00:00:29.260> where<00:00:29.800> I've<00:00:29.920> taken

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
well here's a version where I've taken

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.830

all<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.550> refined<00:00:30.910> sugar<00:00:31.210> out<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.570> I've

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
all the refined sugar out and I've

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.110 
all the refined sugar out and I've
created<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.320> delicious<00:00:33.250> pop<00:00:33.550> that<00:00:34.000> is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
closer look at how we're gonna make our

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.590 
closer look at how we're gonna make our
pops<00:00:40.870> today<00:00:41.699> so<00:00:42.699> our<00:00:42.850> raspberry<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.420> cream

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
pops today so our raspberry and cream

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.660 
pops today so our raspberry and cream
pops<00:00:43.809> are<00:00:44.049> super<00:00:44.500> easy<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.860> make<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.370> mean<00:00:45.430> the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
pops are super easy to make I mean the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.490 
pops are super easy to make I mean the
the<00:00:45.879> longest<00:00:46.420> part<00:00:46.720> about<00:00:46.839> making<00:00:47.049> these<00:00:47.350> is

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
the longest part about making these is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.140 
the longest part about making these is
you<00:00:47.589> need<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.769> set<00:00:48.489> them<00:00:48.610> in<00:00:48.729> there<00:00:48.850> in<00:00:48.879> the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
you need to set them in there in the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.570 
you need to set them in there in the
freezer<00:00:49.420> for<00:00:49.690> about<00:00:49.809> six<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.739> eight<00:00:50.769> hours<00:00:51.070> so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
freezer for about six to eight hours so

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.000 
freezer for about six to eight hours so
the<00:00:51.940> actual<00:00:52.299> making<00:00:53.140> process<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.860> really

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
the actual making process is really

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.399 
the actual making process is really
simple<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.549> in<00:00:54.790> here<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.299> have<00:00:55.449> my<00:00:55.869> raspberries

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
simple so in here I have my raspberries

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.969 
simple so in here I have my raspberries
now<00:00:56.589> I<00:00:56.619> have<00:00:56.949> using<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.970> have<00:00:58.299> used<00:00:58.659> sorry<00:00:59.199> I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
now I have using I have used sorry I

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.509 
now I have using I have used sorry I
have<00:01:00.460> used<00:01:00.989> frozen<00:01:01.989> raspberries<00:01:02.830> now<00:01:03.159> you<00:01:03.220> can

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
have used frozen raspberries now you can

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.039 
have used frozen raspberries now you can
use<00:01:03.640> fresh<00:01:03.909> raspberries<00:01:04.390> if<00:01:04.690> they<00:01:04.869> are<00:01:04.960> about

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
use fresh raspberries if they are about

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.950 
use fresh raspberries if they are about
and<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:06.070> defrosted<00:01:06.700> them<00:01:07.119> just<00:01:07.330> on<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.720> bench

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
and I defrosted them just on the bench

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840 
and I defrosted them just on the bench
so<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.350> they<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.950> under<00:01:09.310> frost<00:01:09.549> are<00:01:09.670> quite

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
so that they they under frost are quite

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.760 
so that they they under frost are quite
nicely<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.330> slowly<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.960> what<00:01:11.320> I'm<00:01:11.409> gonna<00:01:11.530> do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
nicely and slowly and what I'm gonna do

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.350 
nicely and slowly and what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:11.950> I'm<00:01:12.100> gonna<00:01:12.189> put<00:01:12.520> into<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.790> bulky<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.299> I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
is I'm gonna put into this bulky and I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
am using a bowl with a spout a reason

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.950 
am using a bowl with a spout a reason
why<00:01:15.910> I'm<00:01:16.000> using<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.270> bowl<00:01:16.450> for<00:01:16.630> spout<00:01:16.870> it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
why I'm using a bowl for spout it's

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.140 
why I'm using a bowl for spout it's
gonna<00:01:17.050> be<00:01:17.230> easier<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:17.710> me<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:18.370> fill<00:01:18.670> my

gonna be easier for me to to fill my
popsicle<00:01:20.070> molds<00:01:21.070> once<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.610> mix<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.000> made<00:01:22.030> so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
popsicle molds once the mix is made so

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.320 
popsicle molds once the mix is made so
I'm<00:01:22.630> gonna<00:01:22.780> place<00:01:23.110> into<00:01:24.040> my<00:01:24.400> my<00:01:24.850> bowl<00:01:25.090> with<00:01:25.300> a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
about two cups of raspberries which is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.560 
about two cups of raspberries which is
about<00:01:30.580> all<00:01:30.700> I've<00:01:30.820> got<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.030> here<00:01:31.060> which<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.450> just

about all I've got in here which is just

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.500 
about all I've got in here which is just
the<00:01:31.900> perfect<00:01:32.140> amount<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.940> two<00:01:34.150> cups<00:01:34.390> of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
the perfect amount the two cups of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.980 
the perfect amount the two cups of
raspberries<00:01:34.960> go<00:01:35.230> into<00:01:35.500> there<00:01:36.570> using<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.660> fork

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
raspberries go into there using a fork

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.680 
raspberries go into there using a fork
I'm<00:01:38.230> just<00:01:38.500> going<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.830> mesh<00:01:39.159> those<00:01:39.880> raspberries

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
I'm just going to mesh those raspberries

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.470 
I'm just going to mesh those raspberries
just<00:01:41.020> until<00:01:41.350> they're<00:01:41.470> slightly<00:01:41.980> mesh<00:01:42.909> not<00:01:43.240> not

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
just until they're slightly mesh not not

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.820 
just until they're slightly mesh not not
heavily<00:01:43.870> mesh<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.260> I<00:01:44.409> still<00:01:44.620> like<00:01:44.800> to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
heavily mesh because I still like to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.460 
heavily mesh because I still like to
have<00:01:45.070> big<00:01:45.610> chunks<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.060> raspberries<00:01:46.630> through

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
have big chunks of raspberries through

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.270 
have big chunks of raspberries through
my<00:01:47.590> popsicles<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:50.290> consistency<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.130> we're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
my popsicles the consistency that we're

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.920 
my popsicles the consistency that we're
looking<00:01:51.430> for<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:51.880> something<00:01:52.180> like<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.659> so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
looking for is something like that so

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.649 
looking for is something like that so
lightly<00:01:53.650> mash<00:01:53.950> together<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.880> really<00:01:55.270> good
