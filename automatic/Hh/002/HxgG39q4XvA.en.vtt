preload and afterload do inside of the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
preload and afterload do inside of the
heart<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.009> let's<00:00:14.340> start<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.759> two-minute

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
heart so let's start that two-minute

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.960 
heart so let's start that two-minute
clock<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.870> as<00:00:16.020> always<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.369> brought<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
clock and as always this is brought to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.260 
clock and as always this is brought to
you<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:18.170> simple<00:00:19.170> nursing<00:00:19.560> comm<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.820> number

you by simple nursing comm the number
one<00:00:21.449> student<00:00:21.840> nurse<00:00:22.170> success<00:00:22.710> site<00:00:22.980> helping

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
one student nurse success site helping

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.839 
one student nurse success site helping
over<00:00:23.970> 40,000<00:00:24.900> nursing<00:00:25.320> students<00:00:25.859> decrease

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
over 40,000 nursing students decrease

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.720 
over 40,000 nursing students decrease
their<00:00:27.090> stress<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.830> increase<00:00:28.830> their<00:00:29.460> success

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
their stress and increase their success

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.540 
their stress and increase their success
so<00:00:30.630> guys<00:00:30.810> let's<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.949> preload

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so guys let's get to it here so preload

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
so guys let's get to it here so preload
and<00:00:32.700> afterload<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.930> things<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and afterload and a lot of things in the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950 
and afterload and a lot of things in the
heart<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:34.950> very<00:00:35.399> confusing<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
heart can be very confusing but if you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.260 
heart can be very confusing but if you
guys<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> heart<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
guys just think of the heart like a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.260 
guys just think of the heart like a
slingshot<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.739> bottom<00:00:41.309> chambers<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
slingshot the bottom chambers of the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.990 
slingshot the bottom chambers of the
heart<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> ventricles<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.250> where<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
heart the ventricles this is where the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
heart the ventricles this is where the
preload<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.110> we're<00:00:46.289> pulling<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
preload when we're pulling back this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
preload when we're pulling back this
slingshot<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.559> slingshot<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
slingshot and the slingshot we have a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.180 
slingshot and the slingshot we have a
handful<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> blood<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.649> we're<00:00:52.800> pushing

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
handful of blood that we're pushing

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.270 
handful of blood that we're pushing
either<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> body<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.829> lungs

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
either into the body or into the lungs

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
either into the body or into the lungs
now<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> slingshot<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.020> were<00:00:58.199> pulling<00:00:58.500> back

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
now the slingshot we were pulling back

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.990 
now the slingshot we were pulling back
this<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.579> preload<00:01:00.539> guys<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.770> after<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.550> let

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this is preload guys now after we let

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830 
this is preload guys now after we let
this<00:01:03.480> slingshot<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.570> after<00:01:06.570> load

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
this slingshot go this is after load

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
this slingshot go this is after load
basically<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.280> amount<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> pressure<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
basically the amount of pressure that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.410 
basically the amount of pressure that
has<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> overcome<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:11.030> enter<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> next

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
has to be overcome to enter the next

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
has to be overcome to enter the next
portion<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.860> body<00:01:14.040> whether<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
portion of the body whether it be the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.260 
portion of the body whether it be the
lungs<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.619> actual<00:01:16.700> peripherals<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
lungs or the actual peripherals so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
lungs or the actual peripherals so
please<00:01:18.840> don't<00:01:19.320> make<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> overly<00:01:20.340> confusing

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
please don't make this overly confusing

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
please don't make this overly confusing
your<00:01:21.930> heart<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:22.439> four<00:01:22.770> chambers<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.610> pretty

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
your heart has four chambers it's pretty

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530 
your heart has four chambers it's pretty
much<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.840> bedroom<00:01:25.500> suite<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.970> two

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
much like a bedroom suite you have two

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.679 
much like a bedroom suite you have two
little<00:01:27.960> chambers<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.590> top<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.820> big<00:01:30.240> rooms

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
little chambers up top and two big rooms

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
little chambers up top and two big rooms
at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> bottom<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> what's<00:01:32.369> called<00:01:32.670> your

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
at the bottom this is what's called your

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.590 
at the bottom this is what's called your
ventricles

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
ventricles

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
ventricles
now<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.079> ventricles<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.460> most

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
now the ventricles are the most

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.390 
now the ventricles are the most
important<00:01:36.540> part<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.680> heart<00:01:37.950> because

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
important part of the heart because

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.969 
important part of the heart because
they're<00:01:38.909> responsible<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.689> pulling<00:01:40.560> back

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
they're responsible for pulling back

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.940 
they're responsible for pulling back
like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.369> slingshot<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.420> preload<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> after

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
like a slingshot the preload and after

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
like a slingshot the preload and after
this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.340> let<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:45.060> they're<00:01:45.600> responsible<00:01:46.110> for

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this is let go they're responsible for

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
this is let go they're responsible for
pushing<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.220> blood<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.659> blood<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pushing this blood and this blood is so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
pushing this blood and this blood is so
important<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.700> supposed<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.180> be

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
important because it's supposed to be

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
important because it's supposed to be
getting<00:01:51.600> oxygen<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> rest<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> body

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
getting oxygen to the rest of the body

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
getting oxygen to the rest of the body
so<00:01:54.780> whether<00:01:55.079> we're<00:01:55.259> talking<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> right

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so whether we're talking about the right

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
so whether we're talking about the right
side<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> heart<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.810> deoxygenated

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
side of the heart we have deoxygenated

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.100 
side of the heart we have deoxygenated
blood<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.399> into<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.420> lungs<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.899> get

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
blood going into the lungs to get

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.340 
blood going into the lungs to get
oxygenated<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> left

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
oxygenated then it's going to the left

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.429 
oxygenated then it's going to the left
side<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> heart<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:06.290> distribute<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
side of the heart to distribute that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.070 
side of the heart to distribute that
oxygen<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.489> red<00:02:08.700> blood<00:02:08.849> cells<00:02:09.209> around

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
oxygen on those red blood cells around
