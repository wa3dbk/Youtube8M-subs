tight and then my turn my jar upside

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.750 
tight and then my turn my jar upside
down<00:02:51.720> while<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> pack<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.220> next<00:02:53.430> jars

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
down while I pack all the next jars

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.700 
down while I pack all the next jars
until<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.270> get<00:02:54.540> my<00:02:54.690> seven<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.440> canner

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
until I get my seven or this canner

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.920 
until I get my seven or this canner
holds<00:02:56.160> nine<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.300> how<00:02:57.390> your<00:02:57.540> sugar<00:02:57.750> is

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
holds nine and see how your sugar is

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.480 
holds nine and see how your sugar is
melting<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.710> don't<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.100> do<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.370> that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
melting if you don't like to do it that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.030 
melting if you don't like to do it that
way<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.910> make<00:03:00.030> us<00:03:00.210> syrup<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.830> takes

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
way you can make us syrup and it takes

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.890 
way you can make us syrup and it takes
about<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.340> cup<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.850> half<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.210> sugar<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.720> about

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
about a cup and a half of sugar to about

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.110 
about a cup and a half of sugar to about
ten<00:03:04.200> cups<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.950> water<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.520> boil<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
ten cups of water and boil it on the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.430 
ten cups of water and boil it on the
stove<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.570> make<00:03:06.810> sure<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> all

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
stove and make sure that it all

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.470 
stove and make sure that it all
dissolves<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.090> water<00:03:09.270> you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
dissolves and then that's the water you

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.510 
dissolves and then that's the water you
used<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> fill<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.260> your<00:03:10.590> jar<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.220> wanted<00:03:11.430> to
