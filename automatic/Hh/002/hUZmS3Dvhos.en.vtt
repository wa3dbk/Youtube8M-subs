00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 how to plant strawberries 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.850
 first of all what we are going to need 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.510
 two cuttings that I bought in the 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.870
 greenhouse with strawberries 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:19.360
 a planter of about 20 centimeters 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:22.020
 depth and about 30 wide tape and 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.600
 insulating tape scissors 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.610
 and some canes that you can buy them in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 a greenhouse or you can also 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.009
 catch from the field 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.980
 another very important thing is a good 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.910
 substrate I always buy the brand as 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.079
 universal because it is land paid with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.879
 earthworm humus 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.780
 that will provide the necessary humidity 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.030
 to your plants and also the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 nutrients that they need for a 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.059
 healthy growth 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 and has filled the earth planter 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.820
 up and now what are we going to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 do is the necessary gap with your finger 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.740
 marking the furrow where they are going to go 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.299
 cuttings of strawberry 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.689
 ok what are we going to do with more 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.689
 depth 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.300
 normal we put one here 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 and we fill it 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 crush with your hand to stay 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.350
 all right 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.010
 and now we do the same operation with 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.770
 the other 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.020
 I already have the two can pots of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.969
 cuttings of planted strawberries 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.730
 to the gardener we are going to have to 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:53.630
 put some canes 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.660
 because in the strawberry with the weight would make 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.390
 the plants the leaves will fall then 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.240
 As a subjection it is advisable to put in 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.840
 this case as there are two plants we are going to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 put three rods we put one located 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.500
 next to the first floor another the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 we puncture in the center 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.230
 and others we put them on the other side 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.710
 of the other strawberry 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.690
 and we would have our strawberry plant 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.270
 planted the only thing you have to do 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 is to tighten the earth so that it fits 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.720
 compact watering and wait for the dough 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.780
 grow a little more more or less inside 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.130
 of 15 days you can throw some fertilizer and 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.200
 I have a fertilizer for citrus that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.989
 it works very well and that makes 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.150
 plants grow a lot and always too 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.959
 fumigate them to avoid 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 have problems with fungus flies 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.879
 white and other I of fumigator for 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.330
 all my lap I use what is a boat 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.670
 Concentrate of the brand piri lex 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.430
 that dissolves with water and the truth is 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.520
 that works pretty well that if not 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.590
 you can eat fruit or in the case of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.200
 parsley you can not use it until 15 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.570
 days later but all the bugs are 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.920
 they remove and this is all this is the 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.690
 planted with a small plant in a garden 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.870
 strawberry orchard pot I hope that you 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.870
 I liked it
