together with steel I made this template
out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.530> construction<00:00:34.530> paper<00:00:34.890> i<00:00:35.510> think<00:00:36.510> what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
out of construction paper i think what

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.139 
out of construction paper i think what
i'm<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> bevel

these edges and the top but not do it on
this<00:00:42.600> edge<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.800> did

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this edge here because that's what i did

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
this edge here because that's what i did
on<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> plate<00:00:44.960> on<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.170> plates<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
on this plate on these plates here I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.569 
on this plate on these plates here I
bevel<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> top<00:00:47.899> top<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> side<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.460> the

bevel the top top the side here but the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
bevel the top top the side here but the
very<00:00:51.199> inside<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.260> didn't<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.160> hopefully

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
very inside I didn't and then hopefully

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.430
