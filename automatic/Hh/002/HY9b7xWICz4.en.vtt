compatibility<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:04.069> for<00:00:05.069> epic<00:00:05.670> forks<00:00:06.029> and

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
compatibility video for epic forks and

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.390 
compatibility video for epic forks and
torture<00:00:07.799> forks<00:00:09.380> so<00:00:10.380> first<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> all<00:00:11.099> around

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
torture forks so first of all around

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.499 
torture forks so first of all around
these<00:00:11.519> forks<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.120> thread<00:00:12.420> this

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
these forks you have to thread this

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.670 
these forks you have to thread this
headset<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> means<00:00:14.910> any<00:00:15.210> integrated<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
headset so I means any integrated or you

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040 
headset so I means any integrated or you
know<00:00:16.740> standard<00:00:17.039> headset<00:00:17.369> will<00:00:17.460> work<00:00:17.840> all<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
know standard headset will work all the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
know standard headset will work all the
headsets<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:19.920> eighth<00:00:20.039> inch<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.789> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
headsets are one on one eighth inch so I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.109 
headsets are one on one eighth inch so I
need<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> maximum<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.020> work

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
need be a maximum like that will work

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.330 
need be a maximum like that will work
pretty<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.210> every<00:00:24.420> scooter<00:00:24.630> has<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.019> size

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
pretty much every scooter has that size

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.320 
pretty much every scooter has that size
so<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.400> long<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> throw<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:26.970> heads<00:00:27.180> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so as long as you throw this heads on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
so as long as you throw this heads on
there<00:00:27.480> it'll<00:00:27.599> work<00:00:28.250> when<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.340> reason<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
there it'll work when you reason the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.730 
there it'll work when you reason the
stock<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.570> threaded<00:00:31.349> system<00:00:31.619> won't

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
stock you know threaded system won't

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.819 
stock you know threaded system won't
work<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.189> centrally<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.579> won't<00:00:32.730> fit

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
work because it centrally just won't fit

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
work because it centrally just won't fit
no<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.280> too<00:00:35.399> small<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.170> fed<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
no it's too small so if you have fed the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.369 
no it's too small so if you have fed the
system<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
system so it's kind of like this so this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.100 
system so it's kind of like this so this
is<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> TSI<00:00:43.980> standard<00:00:44.430> flight<00:00:44.640> deck<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.450> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is the TSI standard flight deck as a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.569 
is the TSI standard flight deck as a
standard<00:00:46.469> hits<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.520> know

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
standard hits it on it you know

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.709 
standard hits it on it you know
throughout<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.910> ad<00:00:48.090> said<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> course<00:00:48.480> let

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
throughout this ad said of course let

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
throughout this ad said of course let
the<00:00:48.840> threadless<00:00:49.050> forks<00:00:49.410> work<00:00:49.879> another

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the threadless forks work another

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.099 
the threadless forks work another
example<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.969> Phoenix<00:00:57.480> integrated<00:00:57.930> deck

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
example is it Phoenix integrated deck

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.529 
example is it Phoenix integrated deck
and<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:59.309> grade<00:00:59.430> headset<00:00:59.910> bearing<00:01:00.300> sit

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and your grade headset bearing sit

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.320 
and your grade headset bearing sit
inside<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.559> thread<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.430> works

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.780 

now<00:01:08.200> nothing<00:01:08.410> you<00:01:08.710> have<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.860> have<00:01:09.130> this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
now nothing you have to have this

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.530 
now nothing you have to have this
compression<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.740> both<00:01:12.520> these<00:01:12.700> forks<00:01:13.030> with<00:01:13.390> any

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
compression so both these forks with any

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.410 
compression so both these forks with any
compression<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.920> go<00:01:15.010> ICS<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:17.110> HIC<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:17.860> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
compression can go ICS and do HIC for it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.800 
compression can go ICS and do HIC for it
or<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.540> can<00:01:19.630> go<00:01:19.690> SCS<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.090> let<00:01:22.420> some<00:01:22.570> work<00:01:22.690> for

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
or you can go SCS so let some work for

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.920 
or you can go SCS so let some work for
ICS<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:26.290> this<00:01:26.470> little<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:28.450> stop<00:01:28.720> right

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
ICS is this little little stop right

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.650 
ICS is this little little stop right
there<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.370> lot<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.670> folks<00:01:30.910> have<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:31.360> so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
there so a lot of folks have that so

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.740 
there so a lot of folks have that so
long<00:01:31.900> for<00:01:32.170> calves<00:01:32.380> that'll<00:01:32.620> work<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:32.860> ICS

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
long for calves that'll work for ICS

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.190 
long for calves that'll work for ICS
bolt<00:01:34.750> stops<00:01:35.190> sticks<00:01:36.190> up<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.930> goes<00:01:38.170> in

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
bolt stops sticks up there this goes in

with you know if you want go HSE on it
you<00:02:02.830> can<00:02:02.950> use<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> HSE<00:02:03.640> clamp<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:04.119> both<00:02:04.300> these

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
you can use the HSE clamp for both these

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.160 
you can use the HSE clamp for both these
Forks<00:02:04.840> or<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:07.119> can<00:02:07.270> use<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.420> GoPro<00:02:07.750> total
