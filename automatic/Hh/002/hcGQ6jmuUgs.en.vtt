process it is able to understand the
face<00:03:56.920> characteristic<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:59.360> all<00:03:59.569> of<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
face characteristic of that all of the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.350 
face characteristic of that all of the
speakers<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.620> he<00:04:01.430> actually<00:04:01.610> corrects<00:04:02.209> them

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
speakers and he actually corrects them

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.870

now<00:04:03.350> there<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.650> demo<00:04:03.980> mode<00:04:04.310> which<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.700> can

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
now there is a demo mode which I can

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.250 
now there is a demo mode which I can
show<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.180> we're<00:04:05.510> going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.720> do<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.959> later<00:04:06.170> on

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
show you we're going to do that later on

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.340 
show you we're going to do that later on
together<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:08.000> just<00:04:08.180> take<00:04:08.360> only<00:04:08.780> two

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
together and I can just take only two

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.290 
together and I can just take only two
channels<00:04:09.890> for<00:04:10.250> example<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.700> right<00:04:10.880> channel

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and the surround right and I can switch

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.539 
and the surround right and I can switch
that<00:04:14.060> feature<00:04:14.510> off<00:04:14.660> or<00:04:15.019> on<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:16.070> difference

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
