first<00:00:32.880> profession<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.870> gonna<00:00:34.079> be

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
first profession was gonna be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.670 
first profession was gonna be
blacksmithing<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:37.469> saying

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
blacksmithing I think and I saying

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.209 
blacksmithing I think and I saying
profession<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.850> enchanting<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
profession is gonna be enchanting and

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
profession is gonna be enchanting and
there's<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.550> much<00:00:41.730> reasoning<00:00:42.180> behind<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
there's not much reasoning behind this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.020 
there's not much reasoning behind this
other<00:00:42.840> than<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> fact<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.070> looked<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
other than the fact that I looked up the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.560 
other than the fact that I looked up the
top<00:00:45.239> miss<00:00:45.510> rivers<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:47.420> these<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
top miss rivers and these the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
top miss rivers and these the
professions<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.170> using<00:00:49.500> simple<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
professions they're using simple as that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.510 
professions they're using simple as that
and<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.480> makes<00:00:51.719> sense<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.110> head

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
and it makes sense in my head

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.350 
and it makes sense in my head
blacksmithing<00:00:53.520> allows<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.210> more

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
blacksmithing allows for more
