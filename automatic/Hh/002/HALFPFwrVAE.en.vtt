sighs um it's what I liked about it a
lot<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:34.000> broken<00:02:34.269> up<00:02:34.629> into<00:02:35.370> little

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
lot is that it's broken up into little

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.619 
lot is that it's broken up into little
paragraphs<00:02:37.599> almost<00:02:38.049> like<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:40.150> was<00:02:40.599> a

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
paragraphs almost like this was a

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.350 
paragraphs almost like this was a
paragraph<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.680> skip<00:02:42.340> down<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.150> it's<00:02:43.269> not

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
paragraph and then skip down so it's not

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.170 
paragraph and then skip down so it's not
just<00:02:43.420> full<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.129> seemed<00:02:45.430> every<00:02:45.970> pic

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
just full one you know seemed every pic

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.479 
just full one you know seemed every pic
every<00:02:46.660> chapter<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.769> thought<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.099> was<00:02:48.250> good

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
every chapter so I thought that was good

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.039 
every chapter so I thought that was good
and<00:02:48.579> it<00:02:48.700> kind<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:48.940> made<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.269> easier<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.720> stop

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
and it kind of made it easier to stop

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.360 
and it kind of made it easier to stop
because<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.470> could<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.799> say<00:02:50.890> okay<00:02:51.250> I'll<00:02:51.340> just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
because I could just say okay I'll just

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.550 
because I could just say okay I'll just
read<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.849> last<00:02:52.060> paragraph<00:02:52.629> because<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.410> was

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
read this last paragraph because it was

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.900 
read this last paragraph because it was
hard<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.890> stop<00:02:54.099> reading<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.579> um<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:57.160> was<00:02:57.370> um

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
hard to stop reading it um it was um

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.170 
hard to stop reading it um it was um
very<00:02:58.470> easy<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.620> read<00:02:59.799> very<00:03:00.430> fast<00:03:00.730> food<00:03:01.030> it's

very easy to read very fast food it's
not<00:03:01.329> that<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.680> thick<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:05.130> so
