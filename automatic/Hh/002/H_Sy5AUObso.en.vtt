hi<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.709> think<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:02.190> discovered<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:03.030> new<00:00:03.689> way<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.929> use

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hi I think I discovered a new way to use

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.129 
hi I think I discovered a new way to use
this<00:00:05.190> mood<00:00:05.490> joint<00:00:07.370> tool<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:09.030> using<00:00:09.540> more<00:00:09.900> than

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this mood joint tool but using more than

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.370 
this mood joint tool but using more than
two<00:00:10.500> bones<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.490> actually<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.380> sheathing

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
two bones it is actually like sheathing

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.180 
two bones it is actually like sheathing
the<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.130> software<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:15.240> make<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.660> think<00:00:16.379> that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the the software to make it think that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.630 
the the software to make it think that
he<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.670> moving<00:00:18.060> an<00:00:18.449> image<00:00:19.230> only<00:00:19.650> using<00:00:20.039> two

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
he is moving an image only using two

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.300 
he is moving an image only using two
bones<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.300> he<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.779> actually<00:00:22.350> moving<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
bones but he is actually moving the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
bones but he is actually moving the
image<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.939> three<00:00:24.359> moons<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.820> here<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> how<00:00:27.539> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
image with three moons so here is how I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
image with three moons so here is how I
made<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.150> here<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.269> my<00:00:30.449> arm

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
made it here is my arm

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.010 
made it here is my arm
it<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.080> totally<00:00:31.619> vertical<00:00:32.279> okay<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.750> be

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it is totally vertical okay it can be

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
it is totally vertical okay it can be
horizontal<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.940> case<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> image<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
horizontal to this case the image is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.030 
horizontal to this case the image is
vertical<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:39.239> create<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.750> bomb<00:00:39.930> layer<00:00:40.170> okay

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
vertical and I create a bomb layer okay

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.020 
vertical and I create a bomb layer okay
which<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.510> character<00:00:43.079> layer<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.030> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
which can be your character layer and I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.779 
which can be your character layer and I
will<00:00:45.360> create<00:00:45.950> three<00:00:46.950> bones<00:00:47.750> one<00:00:49.250> two<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
will create three bones one two and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.200 
will create three bones one two and
three<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> entire<00:00:52.500> arm<00:00:52.980> okay<00:00:53.640> including

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
three for the entire arm okay including

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.270 
three for the entire arm okay including
the<00:00:54.360> Hat

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the Hat

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.540 
the Hat
now<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.020> arm<00:00:59.870> image<00:01:00.870> layer

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
now I will go to the arm image layer

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.670 
now I will go to the arm image layer
select<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:03.030> bones<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
select these two bones because I will I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.560 
select these two bones because I will I
will<00:01:04.920> create<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.360> smart<00:01:07.260> smart<00:01:08.159> joint<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
will create the smart smart joint so I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.399 
will create the smart smart joint so I
will<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.549> bone<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> create<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.960> smooth

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
will go to bone and create a smooth

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.789 
will go to bone and create a smooth
joint<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.590> test<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:18.799> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
joint okay so now if I test it the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.660 
joint okay so now if I test it the
smooth<00:01:20.520> joint<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.060> working<00:01:21.770> for<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.070> part<00:01:23.400> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
smooth joint is working for this part of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
smooth joint is working for this part of
the<00:01:23.880> arm<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.979> working

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the arm but this one is not working

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
the arm but this one is not working
right<00:01:27.530> okay<00:01:28.549> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.479> main<00:01:30.659> problem

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
right okay this is the the main problem

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.830 
right okay this is the the main problem
and<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.790> sort<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:34.130> will<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.840> will

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and to sort that I will make this I will

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.190 
and to sort that I will make this I will
take<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> crop<00:01:39.439> image<00:01:40.439> tool<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
take the crop image tool this one and I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
take the crop image tool this one and I
will<00:01:43.530> crop<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:45.479> image<00:01:45.750> until<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
will crop this image until here so I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
will crop this image until here so I
have<00:01:47.579> an<00:01:47.700> image<00:01:49.040> which<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.610> showing<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have an image which is not showing the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.359 
have an image which is not showing the
hand<00:01:52.740> okay<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.020> duplicate<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
hand okay and I will duplicate this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
hand okay and I will duplicate this
image<00:01:56.840> okay<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.409> name<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.710> hand<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.259> will

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
image okay I can name it hand and I will

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
image okay I can name it hand and I will
use<00:02:02.159> again<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.719> crop<00:02:03.990> tool<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.000> show<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
use again the crop tool but to show the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.940 
use again the crop tool but to show the
other<00:02:07.439> side<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.819> hand<00:02:09.060> okay<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.649> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950

place
the<00:02:12.810> jewy<00:02:13.050> match<00:02:13.319> will<00:02:13.860> overlap<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.209> too

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the jewy match will overlap a little too

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.610 
the jewy match will overlap a little too
-<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:18.390> fill<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.900> gap<00:02:19.560> between<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.760> okay<00:02:21.360> so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
- to fill the gap between them okay so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.809 
- to fill the gap between them okay so
now<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.250> my<00:02:23.610> hand<00:02:24.500> image<00:02:25.500> layer<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
now I have my hand image layer and I

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.990 
now I have my hand image layer and I
will<00:02:27.510> select<00:02:27.870> these<00:02:28.080> two<00:02:28.410> bones<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.700> will

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
will select these two bones and I will

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.080 
will select these two bones and I will
tell<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.450> software<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:32.160> image<00:02:32.580> used

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
tell the software that this image used

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.020 
tell the software that this image used
these<00:02:33.510> two<00:02:33.840> points<00:02:34.230> two<00:02:34.680> bonds<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.430> create<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
these two points two bonds to create a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.190 
these two points two bonds to create a
smooth<00:02:36.780> joint<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.220> select<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.270> now<00:02:39.930> if

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
smooth joint so I select this and now if

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.460 
smooth joint so I select this and now if
I<00:02:40.380> test<00:02:40.940> Mary<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.380> how<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.730> working

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
I test Mary I can see how it is working

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.900 
I test Mary I can see how it is working
for<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.100> two<00:02:47.340> layers<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:50.190> looks<00:02:50.550> like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
for the two layers it is it looks like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.110 
for the two layers it is it looks like
one<00:02:51.390> layer<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.250> actually<00:02:53.459> two

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
one layer but it is actually two

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.350 
one layer but it is actually two
different<00:02:54.420> layers<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.650> works<00:02:56.459> very<00:02:57.030> nice

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
different layers so it works very nice

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.740 
different layers so it works very nice
and<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.830> crop<00:02:59.100> your<00:03:00.440> image<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.709> more
