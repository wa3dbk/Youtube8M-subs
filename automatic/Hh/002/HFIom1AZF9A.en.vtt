00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.069 
the switches have spiders on them
indicating<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> number<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.600> order<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
indicating the number and which order to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.600 
indicating the number and which order to
put<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> glitch

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
put them in so that's not a glitch

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.870 
put them in so that's not a glitch
that's<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> door<00:01:51.509> works<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.350> now

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
that's how the door works but right now

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.999 
that's how the door works but right now
you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.420> levers<00:01:54.750> control<00:01:55.079> access<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you know the levers control access to to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.639 
you know the levers control access to to
this<00:01:56.100> room<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.909> cannot<00:01:57.479> access<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.439> lever

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this room but I cannot access the lever

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
this room but I cannot access the lever
so<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> means<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> can't<00:01:59.490> access<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> room<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
so it means I can't access the room so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
so it means I can't access the room so
