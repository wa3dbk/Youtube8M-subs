00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
it tomorrow and yup arctic silver five

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.270 
it tomorrow and yup arctic silver five
high<00:01:32.210> temperature<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.690> going<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:32.990> down<00:01:33.280> so

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
high temperature is going to go down so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.060 
high temperature is going to go down so
it<00:01:34.340> was<00:01:34.460> 40<00:01:34.820> degrees<00:01:35.030> port<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:36.649> it's<00:01:36.830> going<00:01:37.009> to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
it was 40 degrees port now it's going to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.680 
it was 40 degrees port now it's going to
be<00:01:37.390> like<00:01:38.649> guessing<00:01:39.649> not<00:01:40.009> oh<00:01:40.040> yeah<00:01:42.729> 33<00:01:43.729> not<00:01:44.509> only

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
be like guessing not oh yeah 33 not only

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.249 
be like guessing not oh yeah 33 not only
does<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.170> Arctic<00:01:45.470> solar<00:01:46.240> because

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
does it have the Arctic solar because

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.780 
does it have the Arctic solar because
last<00:01:48.259> time<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.530> by<00:01:48.770> too<00:01:48.830> much<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.280> no<00:01:49.340> case<00:01:49.580> of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
last time that by too much so no case of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.270 
last time that by too much so no case of
that<00:01:49.970> would<00:01:50.149> screw<00:01:50.509> up<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.990> thermal<00:01:51.890> transfer

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
that would screw up the thermal transfer

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.170 
that would screw up the thermal transfer
oh<00:01:55.420> that's<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.660> Oh<00:01:57.070> tomorrow<00:01:58.070> make<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> rebuild

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
oh that's it Oh tomorrow make a rebuild

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.719 
oh that's it Oh tomorrow make a rebuild
video<00:01:59.509> he'll<00:02:00.470> point<00:02:00.710> really<00:02:00.979> but<00:02:01.160> might<00:02:01.640> as
