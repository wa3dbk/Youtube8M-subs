00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.750
 this video the technology news of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.910
 calendar week 34 2013 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.769
 finally was the release schedule for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
 two weeks later on 29 november 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 sony has also announced that the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.070
 Playstation 4 around a million times 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.420
 was pre-ordered 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 that is much more than that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 playstation 3 and playstation 2 together 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 unfortunately the release date of the xbox is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 little is known yet 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.890
 However, the fifth of November there 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.559
 some games come out but you know 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.290
 that every pre-ordered xbox with fifa 14 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.480
 is delivered origin has now 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 a right of return for games at ea 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.399
 title has now the right game 24th 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 hours after the first game start or 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.950
 seven days after the purchase again 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.449
 return 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 besides, this is only limited to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.590
 download purchases not now be about 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.870
 bought in by a castor 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 then this is also activated 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.699
 Nevertheless, a great thing from ea the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.650
 Playstation 4 could do something again 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 become stronger than the xbox one 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.680
 Although both have a Jaguar processor 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 from amd 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 but there are only differences 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.549
 playstation 4 supports yuma one 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.950
 technology from amd allows this technology 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.630
 Graphics unit and processor on 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.479
 to access the same storage area 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the case of the xbox of that is so though 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.830
 cpu and gpu use the same memory 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 both can not be on the same 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 memory area that means 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.790
 if cpu and gpu do the same things 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 need these things too 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.380
 be in the RAM twice 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.840
 the cost of course, much space has indeed 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 the xbox osram for the graphics unit 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 but for that , however, and the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.320
 playstation 4 c ddr5 ram is why 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.189
 currently on the datasheet the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.200
 Playstation 4 but much stronger or 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.540
 evg has new gamescom games 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 graphics cards presented the special 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.290
 on the cards is the dual bios per 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.090
 you can switch on to the second 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.280
 change and this brings some 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 benefits just for over takter at 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 graphics cards, it is so set 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.300
 that they never or only briefly more than that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.489
 tdp can consume at second 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 We pay the power package by 10 to 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.150
 15 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.120
 is powered by voltages up to 1 35 volt 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.040
 should be possible with 1 35 volt can 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.320
 then you already overclock properly 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.660
 Thus , the bios allows that one 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.020
 place fans at 20 instead of 30 percent 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.880
 can 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.160
 so that the card in idle too much 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.230
 quiet is planned but are only 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.760
 has lg gtx 760 770 and 780 new 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.580
 smartphone display presented 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.040
 It is 5 5 inches tall and has one 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:47.460
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels what 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.960
 corresponds to a pixeldichte of 538 pp 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.930
 Actually one knows so high 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.230
 Resolutions only from google nexus 10 and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.820
 of 27 inch monitors loud lg offers that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.070
 new panel but not just a higher one 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.900
 resolution but also an improved one 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.120
 color reproduction and optimize 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.610
 Contrast values, on the other hand, they are great 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.890
 display of the galaxy s 4 certainly shit 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.840
 out that it was also found again 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.310
 technology news with this week if it 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.910
 you liked the video one 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.350
 thumbs up 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.750
 if you have questions write in 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.620
 the comments then i would say up 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.620
