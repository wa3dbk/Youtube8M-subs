00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
construction down by the doggie center

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
construction down by the doggie center
in<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.810> South<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.110> Market<00:04:43.170> campus<00:04:43.770> okay

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
in the South of Market campus okay

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.060 
in the South of Market campus okay
that's<00:04:44.730> sort<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.600> gateway<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.140> it's

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
that's sort of like the gateway to it's

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.680 
that's sort of like the gateway to it's
going<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.400> be<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.700> nude<00:04:47.850> gateway<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.660> the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
going to be the nude gateway to the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.150 
going to be the nude gateway to the
canvas<00:04:48.990> there<00:04:49.470> because<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.890> interstate

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
canvas there because of the interstate

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.410 
canvas there because of the interstate
80<00:04:51.170> exposure<00:04:52.170> there<00:04:52.920> so<00:04:53.400> we<00:04:53.820> should<00:04:54.030> move<00:04:54.180> into

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
80 exposure there so we should move into

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.840 
80 exposure there so we should move into
that<00:04:54.600> academic<00:04:55.170> building<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:56.100> june<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.790> next

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
that academic building in june of next

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.220 
that academic building in june of next
year<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.890> i<00:04:58.920> think<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.970> couple<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.570> week<00:05:00.690> 7<00:05:01.080> from

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
in these science and technology okay

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.219 
in these science and technology okay
five<00:05:29.819> million<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.389> was<00:05:30.720> going<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.110> go

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
five million of that was going to go

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.999 
five million of that was going to go
towards<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.710> winery<00:05:33.379> we<00:05:34.379> raised<00:05:34.800> an

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
right now we are in the process of

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.070 
right now we are in the process of
planning<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.699> white<00:05:39.090> man<00:05:39.300> in<00:05:39.389> fact<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:39.870> have<00:05:40.050> a

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
planning that white man in fact I have a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.839 
planning that white man in fact I have a
lot<00:05:40.289> of<00:05:40.319> deadlines<00:05:40.970> by<00:05:41.970> one<00:05:42.210> day<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.520> lot

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
lot of deadlines by one day to get a lot

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.670 
lot of deadlines by one day to get a lot
of<00:05:44.879> requirements<00:05:45.419> and<00:05:45.960> there's<00:05:46.199> we're

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
of requirements and there's we're

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.170 
of requirements and there's we're
actually<00:05:46.800> working<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.639> architects

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
actually working with the architects

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.439 
actually working with the architects
right<00:05:48.509> now<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:49.080> designing<00:05:49.470> new<00:05:49.830> winery<00:05:50.449> which

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
right now and designing new winery which

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.980 
right now and designing new winery which
will<00:05:52.159> basically<00:05:53.159> be<00:05:53.550> at<00:05:53.759> that<00:05:53.940> gateway<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.960> the

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
will basically be at that gateway to the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.420 
will basically be at that gateway to the
campus<00:05:55.380> it's<00:05:55.560> going<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.770> be<00:05:55.889> sort<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.250> in<00:05:56.370> the

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
campus it's going to be sort of in the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.339 
campus it's going to be sort of in the
South<00:05:56.669> portion<00:05:57.210> there<00:05:57.449> and<00:05:57.690> then<00:05:58.050> we'll<00:05:58.229> have

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
South portion there and then we'll have

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.050 
South portion there and then we'll have
about<00:05:58.470> 14<00:05:59.039> acres<00:05:59.190> of<00:05:59.460> being<00:05:59.639> you're<00:05:59.789> right

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
about 14 acres of being you're right

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.110 
about 14 acres of being you're right
there<00:06:00.270> also<00:06:00.659> so<00:06:01.409> the<00:06:01.889> brewery<00:06:02.460> will<00:06:02.699> also<00:06:03.000> be

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
there also so the brewery will also be

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.140 
there also so the brewery will also be
in<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.240> same<00:06:03.509> complex<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.759> so<00:06:05.759> we're<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.030> the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
in the same complex so so we're in the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.870 
in the same complex so so we're in the
process<00:06:06.330> we're<00:06:07.199> working<00:06:07.650> with<00:06:08.280> the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
process we're working with the

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.249 
process we're working with the
architects<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:09.630> engineers<00:06:09.719> from<00:06:10.169> the

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
architects and engineers from the

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.580 
architects and engineers from the
University<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:11.750> design<00:06:12.750> a<00:06:12.780> winery<00:06:13.289> and

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
University to design a winery and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.670 
University to design a winery and
growing<00:06:14.250> complex<00:06:14.849> which<00:06:15.569> each<00:06:16.110> will<00:06:16.740> be<00:06:17.509> a

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
growing complex which each will be a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.020 
growing complex which each will be a
separate<00:06:19.680> entity<00:06:19.949> but<00:06:20.280> we're<00:06:20.430> going<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.639> share

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
separate entity but we're going to share

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.029 
separate entity but we're going to share
some<00:06:21.060> facilities<00:06:21.840> just<00:06:22.500> because<00:06:22.740> we<00:06:22.770> don't

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
some facilities just because we don't

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:35.850 
some facilities just because we don't
want<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.250> lot<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.520> redundancy<00:06:23.639> in<00:06:24.180> plus<00:06:24.419> one

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.959 

in<00:06:36.860> here<00:06:37.099> that<00:06:37.249> I<00:06:37.339> found<00:06:37.610> so<00:06:37.789> far<00:06:39.639> you<00:06:40.639> have

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
in here that I found so far you have

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.949 
in here that I found so far you have
some<00:06:41.389> partial<00:06:42.080> wines<00:06:42.259> from<00:06:42.499> 19
