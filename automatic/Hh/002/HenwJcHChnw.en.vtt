00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hey guys what's up it's Chris he rides a

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys what's up it's Chris he rides a
tripod<00:00:01.920> so<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.220> at<00:00:02.280> CES<00:00:02.669> 2012<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.570> have

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
tripod so we're at CES 2012 and we have

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.930 
tripod so we're at CES 2012 and we have
Danny<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.290> co-founder<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.009> Liquipel

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Danny here the co-founder of Liquipel

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
Danny here the co-founder of Liquipel
and<00:00:06.060> he's<00:00:06.150> gonna<00:00:06.270> tell<00:00:06.450> us<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.569> little<00:00:06.660> bit<00:00:06.839> more

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
and he's gonna tell us a little bit more

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:21.700 
and he's gonna tell us a little bit more
about<00:00:07.109> it

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.600 

so<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.860> we<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:24.109> nanotechnology

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
so what we have here is a nanotechnology

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.130 
so what we have here is a nanotechnology
basically<00:00:26.610> what<00:00:26.910> happens<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.660> put<00:00:27.900> your

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
basically what happens is we put your

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
basically what happens is we put your
device<00:00:28.320> inside<00:00:29.009> of<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> specialized<00:00:29.820> piece<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
device inside of a specialized piece of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
device inside of a specialized piece of
machinery<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:31.320> draws<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> vapor<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
machinery it draws a vapor in and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.640 
machinery it draws a vapor in and
actually<00:00:32.780> permeates<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.960> entire<00:00:33.989> device

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
actually permeates the entire device

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
actually permeates the entire device
inside<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.339> out

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
inside and out

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.759 
inside and out
so<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.239> use<00:00:36.449> any<00:00:36.720> plugs<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.290> any<00:00:37.410> sort

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
so we do not use any plugs of any sort

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.799 
so we do not use any plugs of any sort
to<00:00:38.220> keep<00:00:38.400> liquids<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to keep liquids out now it is a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
to keep liquids out now it is a
preventive<00:00:40.230> coating<00:00:40.830> after<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
preventive coating after you have

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.530 
preventive coating after you have
Liquipel<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> don't<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.269> swimming

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
Liquipel you don't want to go swimming

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.960 
Liquipel you don't want to go swimming
scuba<00:00:43.050> diving<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.410> snorkeling<00:00:43.489> but<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
scuba diving or snorkeling but in the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.460 
scuba diving or snorkeling but in the
event<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.510> device<00:00:45.750> comes<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.230> contact

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
event that your device comes in contact

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.350 
event that your device comes in contact
with<00:00:46.739> liquid<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.879> fine<00:00:48.150> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
with liquid it's going to be just fine I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.399 
with liquid it's going to be just fine I
can<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.019> give<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> demonstration

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
can kind of give you a demonstration

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.160 
can kind of give you a demonstration
here<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.520> fun<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.120> pelling<00:00:51.539> Kleenex

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
here we have fun little pelling Kleenex

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
here we have fun little pelling Kleenex
tissues<00:00:52.620> okay<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.940> happens

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
tissues okay so we all know what happens

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
tissues okay so we all know what happens
when<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> Kleenex<00:00:55.440> comes<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> contact<00:00:56.129> with

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
when a Kleenex comes in contact with

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
when a Kleenex comes in contact with
liquids<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.449> obviously<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.350> absorb<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
liquids it obviously will absorb the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
liquids it obviously will absorb the
liquid<00:00:59.359> used<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> merge<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:02.039> Kleenex<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
liquid used to merge this Kleenex and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.450 
liquid used to merge this Kleenex and
you<00:01:03.570> pull<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> completely<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.800> Kleenex

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you pull it completely out the Kleenex

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.320 
you pull it completely out the Kleenex
stays<00:01:05.789> completely<00:01:06.270> dry<00:01:06.600> yes<00:01:07.350> absolutely

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
stays completely dry yes absolutely

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.859 
stays completely dry yes absolutely
Wow<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> technology<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.300> we<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.690> inside

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
Wow so technology is what we put inside

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.680 
Wow so technology is what we put inside
of<00:01:13.259> electronics<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.030> open<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
of electronics we are open for the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.990 
of electronics we are open for the
public<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:21.560> treat<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:22.740> same<00:01:23.280> day<00:01:23.550> send

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
public we have treat them same day send

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.070 
public we have treat them same day send
them<00:01:24.119> back<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.520> exactly<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.750> does

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
them back out now how exactly does does

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.540 
them back out now how exactly does does
it<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.069> circuits<00:01:29.459> and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
it with with all the circuits and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.249 
it with with all the circuits and
everything<00:01:29.849> inside<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.330> device<00:01:30.599> and<00:01:30.869> all

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
everything inside of a device and all

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.839 
everything inside of a device and all
the<00:01:31.349> open<00:01:31.619> ports<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.069> are<00:01:32.160> there<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:32.789> would

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
the open ports that are there how would

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.930 
the open ports that are there how would
it<00:01:32.970> protect<00:01:33.929> those<00:01:34.110> does<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> would<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.099> almost

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
it protect those does it would it almost

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.370 
it protect those does it would it almost
destroy<00:01:36.239> the<00:01:36.420> circuits<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> inside<00:01:37.110> what

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
destroy the circuits on the inside what

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.600 
destroy the circuits on the inside what
it<00:01:37.470> stopped<00:01:37.679> them<00:01:37.830> from<00:01:37.920> connecting<00:01:38.429> all

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it stopped them from connecting all

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
it stopped them from connecting all
right<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.209> so<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.569> like<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.929> Kleenex<00:01:40.319> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
right well so much like this Kleenex the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.339 
right well so much like this Kleenex the
water<00:01:40.679> just<00:01:40.950> stays<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> surface<00:01:42.149> of

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
water just stays on the surface of

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.169 
water just stays on the surface of
whatever<00:01:43.349> is<00:01:43.590> treated<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.099> for<00:01:44.310> example<00:01:44.759> when

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
whatever is treated so for example when

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.800 
whatever is treated so for example when
we<00:01:45.300> put<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.599> phone<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.080> water<00:01:46.520> water<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
we put this phone in the water water is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.240 
we put this phone in the water water is
going<00:01:48.810> throughout<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.470> entire<00:01:49.830> device

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
going throughout the entire device

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.089 
going throughout the entire device
inside<00:01:50.819> and<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.440> stays<00:01:52.440> on<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:52.920> surface

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
inside and out stays on the surface

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.499 
inside and out stays on the surface
preventing<00:01:53.789> corrosion<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.330> how<00:01:57.330> does<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
preventing corrosion so it how does it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
preventing corrosion so it how does it
knock<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.929> into<00:01:58.050> points<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.440> like<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.800> that's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
knock it into points I like that that's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.330 
knock it into points I like that that's
what's<00:01:59.099> blowing<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.580> my<00:01:59.670> action<00:02:01.099> so<00:02:02.099> water

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
what's blowing on my action so water

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.150 
what's blowing on my action so water
will<00:02:02.550> run<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:03.209> device<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:03.989> then<00:02:04.440> how<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.039> it

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
will run the device and then how is it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.740 
will run the device and then how is it
still<00:02:05.340> working<00:02:05.489> after<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.179> because

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
still working after that there because

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
still working after that there because
the<00:02:06.989> water<00:02:07.229> stays<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.830> surface

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the water stays on the surface

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.330 
the water stays on the surface
eventually<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.149> water<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.690> evaporate

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
eventually the water will just evaporate

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.470 
eventually the water will just evaporate
so<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.489> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> stay<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> surface<00:02:12.420> of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
so it's going to stay on the surface of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.300 
so it's going to stay on the surface of
all<00:02:12.569> like<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> circuits<00:02:13.200> everything

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.980 

same<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.210> circuit<00:02:18.540> board<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.780> it'll

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
same with the circuit board and it'll

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.050 
same with the circuit board and it'll
just<00:02:19.200> roll<00:02:19.380> off<00:02:19.560> preventing<00:02:20.400> any<00:02:20.550> corrosion

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
just roll off preventing any corrosion

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.840 
just roll off preventing any corrosion
so<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> see<00:02:24.140> Wow<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> open<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> the

so you see Wow and this is open to the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.610 
so you see Wow and this is open to the
public<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.240> said<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.780> yes<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.410> course
