this is stutter stepping let me explain

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
this is stutter stepping let me explain
this<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.390> more<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.840> there's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
this a little bit more because there's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
this a little bit more because there's
two<00:00:46.350> important<00:00:46.860> things<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.550> by<00:00:48.450> default

two important things going on by default
when<00:00:49.079> you're<00:00:49.260> attacking<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.800> enemy<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.280> won't

actually moved out of your range by
moving<00:00:54.449> between<00:00:54.750> attacks<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> stay<00:00:55.800> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
moving between attacks you can stay in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
moving between attacks you can stay in
their<00:00:56.070> path<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.850> attacks<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.949> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
their path and get more attacks out the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.680 
their path and get more attacks out the
second<00:00:59.340> thing<00:00:59.489> involves<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.030> animation<00:01:00.420> on

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
second thing involves an animation on

second thing involves an animation on
your<00:01:00.809> character<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> occurs<00:01:01.680> after<00:01:01.890> your

attack goes out watch closely as zaira

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
attack goes out watch closely as zaira
launches<00:01:05.970> her<00:01:06.060> attack<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:08.040> point<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
launches her attack at this point in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
launches her attack at this point in the
animation<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.390> projectile<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> already<00:01:10.710> out

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
animation the projectile is already out

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
animation the projectile is already out
I<00:01:11.400> chose<00:01:12.210> zaira<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.170> quickly<00:01:13.500> her

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
I chose zaira because of how quickly her

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
I chose zaira because of how quickly her
projectile<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.700> fires<00:01:15.000> making<00:01:15.840> her<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
projectile actually fires making her a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
projectile actually fires making her a

animations<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> you'll<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.400> used

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
animations and you'll need to get used

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
animations and you'll need to get used
to<00:01:23.759> each<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.409> remember<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.500> muscle

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to each of them remember that muscle

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
to each of them remember that muscle
memory<00:01:26.040> takes<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.119> build<00:01:27.299> up

memory takes a little time to build up
which<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> important<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> learning

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
which is important not just to learning
