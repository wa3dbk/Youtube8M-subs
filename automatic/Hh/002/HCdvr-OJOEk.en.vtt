00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.899
 I have two connected to the console 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.790
 display tv and 3d helmet both are 720p 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.570
 but the TV takes the signal 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.730
 up to 1080 and glasses up to 1080 p 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.590
 the problem is that the prefix 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.360
 playstation 3 does not enable 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.280
 3d mapping in manual mode 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.930
 special settings in mode 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.930
 automatic she exposes 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.540
 1080p mode maximum for 3d points 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.580
 which TV with its 1080 and 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.469
 cannot swallow and gives out black 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
 the screen ends up every time to 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.769
 switch between glasses and tv 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.989
 I have to wear a helmet 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.059
 reduce resolution there automatically 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.710
 at the same time turning off 3d and only after 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.899
 this prefix starts correctly 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.609
 display the image on the TV why 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.499
 generally need all this about sky link and 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.329
 follow down skylink incomprehensible 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.969
 especially the light of what is standard 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.809
 hdmi 14 all thread games are working in 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.550
 720p 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.440
 that is, the native resolution of my 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.999
 tv and slam anyway 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.280
 the need to change the settings 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.899
 wasting time and annoying so it was 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.999
 decided to find a board on the software 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.430
 ensuring sony consider themselves smarter 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.700
 user for this activate cry of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 luck 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.120
 and switch to debug mode settings 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.750
 take away 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.110
 without automatic all-inclusive 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.760
 then 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 what is the prefix currently displays 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.159
 image on a less advanced display 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 my case is TV 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.880
 go to hdmi settings and select there 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 auto mode 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 prefix will give maxima 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.800
 solution for much display in my 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.760
 the case is 1080 and 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.760
 agree 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.310
 its about prefix miracle includes 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.710
 the ability to display 3d on TV 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 which does not support it and offers 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 choose screen size 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.539
 set the value according to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.539
 the port for my helmet is 150 inches 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.130
 complete the setup and now finally 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 you can safely switch between 3d 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.790
 glasses and TV unnecessarily 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.790
 climb menu and change settings
