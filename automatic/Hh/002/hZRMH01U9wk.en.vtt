00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.650
 we continue with the first final match in Munich leads after 40 minutes with 4 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.539
 to 3 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.080
 but nothing is decided here because Schwenningen pushes on 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 now the merchant can not beat Alwin 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 Munich's keeper with a very strong performance 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 and forward showed her goal once again it was making a top team 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.440
 It claims that its chances are much better than the moral proved 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.080
 to the 10th 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.600
 the better dust gate 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 This time is from the area is just right 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.960
 as expected so it is not the necessary I would even on the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.810
 other side the dogs to the stern first of the games so decide a guy 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.920
 as Buchwieser is or is just German 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.080
 the first two formations are almost equally strong in both teams 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.170
 but the third and fourth in the Munich are obviously a bit tick 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.060
 stronger than the Schwenninger 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.150
 and this is exactly what is happening here today 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 This exciting game presents you come 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.260
 but the statements prove unbelievable despite the renewed attack 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.070
 moral 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.850
 only 29 seconds after the 3 2 5 they are back 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 after two dusty matches for Munich is now 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.540
 Fancy the turn 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.630
 In Lithuania, he used the disc emotionally under the control of Alvin Chew launchen 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.410
 the latte 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.320
 the helios-arena is upside down 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 everything is possible again 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.560
 Of course we want to throw everything in the last ten minutes forward 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.870
 but still in the guest enclosure excellent keel 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.100
 Every tenth German protour team was pissed off over the officials 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.070
 defensive 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 he can only rely on one hundred percent 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.280
 The actions of the hosts are not really that compelling 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.780
 to catch up has cost a lot of strength Munich holds the Schwenninger in the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.599
 Closing phase largely away from your own box 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.530
 With a good two minutes remaining, the decision is made by Renten Wittlich 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 nets one too many for sex 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.389
 but actually this hit should not have counted clearly it was here 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.119
 from Compo 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.939
 but as so often in this game, the pipe of Sikorski remains 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.079
 Ultimately, no matter the fourth Munich wins thanks to the better 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.450
 Chance exploitation the best final at the end not undeserved 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 with 6 too much 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.299
 we just go to many gifts distributed 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.629
 and the players more tied to the other Russian roulette percent inside so 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.279
 we have 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.659
 he is only dead areas if you are fair we have an incredible number 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.889
 Made mistakes because I am on both sides so 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.209
 nevertheless percent played as well as what is easy but the custom was left 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.290
 to win Bill that is so percent of both teams they do not 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:26.180
 atypical game where many many passes are quieter big series series 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.859
 our advantage was that we always made the goals at the right time 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.579
 this time it was enough to win but next time we have to 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.310
 defensively much more stable than today I do not believe that we are in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.229
 Munich 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.809
 March in the desert after the final siren therefore exactly at whom 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.429
 they had to thank 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.759
 The match winner distributed behind but the praise ready to the whole 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.479
 Team continues 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.940
 in the end, bases up and down below 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.089
 hats off in front of the guys many fights about it and took 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.149
 that's pretty clear what she was happy with without the video 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:03.159
 current building is the home right scanned in this series 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.769
 Nevertheless, the two teams presented today presented 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.299
 the finale is still completely open now we have to shut up properly 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.349
 It will be valuable that I can only reload at home on Sunday 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.419
 Finish line 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.219
 the service should still not be over for a long time yet full of 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.180
 Everyone has to know where they are 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.879
 but the first game wins 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.389
 his sister and their ten songs will be part of SÃ¶ren Gonther's part again 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.199
 develop and perform 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.659
 how many people are coming 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.159
 already found it remains so exciting currently is the Bavarian 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.649
 Flag on top of but already in the 70s and supernatural not yet 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.969
 beaten
