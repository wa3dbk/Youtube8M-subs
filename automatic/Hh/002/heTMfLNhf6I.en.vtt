00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.990
 but now we go with that merger between 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.420
 nintendo and the world of tablets and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 mobile phones because good was another

 bring their characters to the world of 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:42.420
 good attentive smartphones because in 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.960
 words for example from yesterday is harlin 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 signature rolls and hs says the following 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 the nintendo alliance of na fits well and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.639
 offers a significant number of synergies 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.850
 for the two companies that are no longer 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:58.589
 leaders in their respective segments do not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 there is only a direct benefit of the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.670
 consumers of smartphones and tablets 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 for nintendo the ecosystem of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.149
 applications is very important for 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 reach new users and make 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.030
 know the brand 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 try to take them to a new 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.880
 senior audience of your business 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
 consoles 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.080
 harlin rolls thinks that the failures of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 had to enter the western market 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.689
 they should not be a problem but yes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.970
 Nintendo decided to monetize its 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.009
 mobile games explains the following the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 alliance gives nintendo an audience 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.369
 greater that is important for a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 financial performance users 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.320
 Japanese spend more per capita in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.909
 mobile than another country and it's the biggest 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
 market for smartphones and laptops 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.619
 it makes commercial sense in many 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 levels the main the main one will be 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.659
 weave the cultures of both companies and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.580
 prepare the pace of development that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 you need in this market with a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.100
 Nintendo more patient in production 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.110
 of games as monetized is a challenge 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.179
 considered the different models 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.159
 used by nintendo and micropayments 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.380
 dena I do not know what will come out there 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.789
 between micro-payments and strategies 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.970
 nintendo we'll see what it is that we 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.200
 they really teach but attentive because they do not 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.270
 talked jack train dedicated to the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.400
 research of the mobile sector 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.310
 it is thought that the market decline 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.200
 mobile to just mean that this 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.600
 agreement is advantageous and that the two 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.210
 companies will have talked about working 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.280
 together since 2010 says the following weigh 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.560
 to the great efforts in development of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.660
 smartphones and international expansion of 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.730
 naa had problems in recent years 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.620
 his initial success was based on games for 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 the web for the mobile market 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.760
 Japanese when the market changed to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 Native mobile games were seen 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.720
 overcome by competitors like the camp 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.450
 nou 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.640
 there is a risk that despite the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.560
 benefits that each part could 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.510
 be too late to take advantage 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.790
 of strengths collaborate with brands 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.830
 established has been an objective of the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.740
 international strategies using 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.110

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.840
 analysts who are pronouncing about 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.510
 that fusion between the characters of 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.700
 nintendo or the nintendo itself and the world 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.780
