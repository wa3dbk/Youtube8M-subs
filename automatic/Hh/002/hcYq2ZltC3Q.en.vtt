all<00:00:01.350> right<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.959> 2001<00:00:04.730> Honda<00:00:05.730> elite

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right so this is a 2001 Honda elite

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:18.920 
all right so this is a 2001 Honda elite
SR<00:00:08.030> 50cc<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:16.440> SR<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.430> D<00:00:18.300> restricted

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
SR 50cc the SR was the D restricted

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.150 
SR 50cc the SR was the D restricted
model<00:00:20.539> bone-stock<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.869> would<00:00:22.050> go<00:00:22.230> about<00:00:22.439> 35

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
model bone-stock this would go about 35

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
model bone-stock this would go about 35
maybe<00:00:24.119> 40<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:25.820> just<00:00:26.820> put<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.830> performance

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
maybe 40 I just put a performance

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.970 
maybe 40 I just put a performance
variator<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> basically

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
variator on it and it just basically

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.610 
variator on it and it just basically
changed<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> gearing<00:00:32.969> gave<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> more<00:00:34.110> gearing

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
changed the gearing gave it more gearing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.299 
changed the gearing gave it more gearing
and<00:00:34.770> it'll<00:00:35.160> cruise<00:00:35.370> 45<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.210> 50<00:00:36.890> top-end

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and it'll cruise 45 to 50 top-end

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
and it'll cruise 45 to 50 top-end
you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.550> cruise<00:00:38.790> 40<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.510> day<00:00:39.660> long<00:00:39.899> which<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you can cruise 40 all day long which is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
you can cruise 40 all day long which is
what<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:42.050> almost<00:00:43.050> 200<00:00:43.440> pounds<00:00:46.520> does

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
what I do and I'm almost 200 pounds does

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
what I do and I'm almost 200 pounds does
have<00:00:47.960> little<00:00:48.960> pouch<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> keep<00:00:51.809> stuff<00:00:52.170> in

gentleman who had actually wrecked it in
the<00:01:18.540> front<00:01:18.810> end<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.729> already<00:01:20.939> done<00:01:21.090> with

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the front end this was already done with

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
the front end this was already done with
fiberglass<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.439> can't<00:01:22.710> tell<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> mean<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
fiberglass I really can't tell I mean I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.600 
fiberglass I really can't tell I mean I
think<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> pretty<00:01:24.659> good<00:01:24.869> job<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.430> was

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think it's a pretty good job and it was

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.870 
think it's a pretty good job and it was
purple<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> repainted<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
purple and then I repainted it with a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.130 
purple and then I repainted it with a
spray<00:01:30.090> gun<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:33.150> firetruck<00:01:33.689> red

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spray gun just firetruck red

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.210 
spray gun just firetruck red
I<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:35.520> turned<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.939> pretty<00:01:36.119> good<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> seat

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I just turned out pretty good the seat

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
I just turned out pretty good the seat
does<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> couple<00:01:39.030> rips<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.409> there

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
does have a couple rips here and there

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.359 
does have a couple rips here and there
you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.619> there<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:46.369> other

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you can see and there you can see other

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.130 
you can see and there you can see other
than<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> damage<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> front<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:49.049> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
than that the damage to the front like I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.530 
than that the damage to the front like I
said<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:50.280> minimal<00:01:50.460> no<00:01:50.939> damage<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
said was very minimal no damage to the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.380 
said was very minimal no damage to the
frame<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:53.189> front<00:01:53.880> piece<00:01:54.090> here

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
frame it was just just front piece here

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.389 
frame it was just just front piece here
just<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.320> fiberglass<00:01:55.680> replace<00:01:58.399> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
just the fiberglass replace the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.510 
just the fiberglass replace the
kickstart<00:02:00.710> mechanism<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:04.520> disassembled

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
kickstart mechanism is disassembled

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.229 
kickstart mechanism is disassembled
right<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:08.239> performance

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
right now just because the performance

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
right now just because the performance
variator<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.170> fits<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.160> was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
variator the way it fits in there it was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
variator the way it fits in there it was
actually<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.849> little<00:02:12.120> too<00:02:12.270> big

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
actually a little too big

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.220 
actually a little too big
so<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.740> have<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.520> kickstart<00:02:15.080> assembly<00:02:16.080> that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so I have the kickstart assembly that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.040 
so I have the kickstart assembly that
will<00:02:16.350> slide<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.130> if<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.690> wish<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
will slide back in if you so wish to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.550 
will slide back in if you so wish to
change<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.650> stock<00:02:20.130> everything<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.150> there

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
change back to stock everything is there

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.010 
change back to stock everything is there
but<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.770> electric<00:02:23.310> start<00:02:23.640> has<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> new

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
but this is electric start has a new

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.200 
but this is electric start has a new
battery<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
battery in it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:35.680 
battery in it
and<00:02:27.210> we'll<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.600> ahead<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.810> start<00:02:28.140> her<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.230> now

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.620 

and<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.440> it
