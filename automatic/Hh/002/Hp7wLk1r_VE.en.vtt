00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.740 
oyster put internal trimmers yes we've
only<00:00:15.719> used<00:00:15.809> these<00:00:16.139> bunks<00:00:17.539> don't<00:00:18.539> know<00:00:18.630> about

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
only used these bunks don't know about

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.790 
only used these bunks don't know about
using<00:00:19.109> them<00:00:19.230> again<00:00:20.600> no<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.680> you

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
using them again no do you want that you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.730 
using them again no do you want that you
can<00:00:22.949> place<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> right<00:00:26.000> there<00:00:27.349> he<00:00:28.349> wanted<00:00:28.590> his

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
can place that right there he wanted his

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
can place that right there he wanted his
comb<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:29.369> I'll<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.670> doing<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.539> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
comb which I'll be doing that or you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.040 
comb which I'll be doing that or you
don't<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.869> too<00:00:30.990> soon<00:00:31.199> too

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.740 

let's<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.790> Sparky's<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:38.969> some<00:00:39.270> light<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
let's see Sparky's got some light and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
let's see Sparky's got some light and
dark<00:00:40.110> nails<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> darker<00:00:41.670> ones<00:00:41.790> are<00:00:41.879> harder

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
dark nails so the darker ones are harder

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
dark nails so the darker ones are harder
harder<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> find<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> pink<00:00:43.829> line<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
harder to find them at the pink line is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
harder to find them at the pink line is
and<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.520> clipped<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.570> too<00:00:45.690> far<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:45.989> he

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and we clipped a little too far and he

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.779 
and we clipped a little too far and he
yelped<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:47.010> didn't<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
yelped and he didn't like it so I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
yelped and he didn't like it so I
haven't<00:00:48.059> used<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.450> since<00:00:48.950> we're<00:00:49.950> gonna

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
haven't used them since we're gonna

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
haven't used them since we're gonna
track<00:00:50.309> him<00:00:50.460> though<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> don't

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
track him though you don't if you don't

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
track him though you don't if you don't
trim<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.219> these<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.610> nails<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:57.030> really

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
trim all these the nails get really

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.630 
trim all these the nails get really
curvy<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> trim<00:00:59.699> them

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
curvy so you need to trim them

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.200 
curvy so you need to trim them
consistently<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> he<00:01:08.010> did<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.670> did<00:01:08.820> put

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
consistently and he did when we did put

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030 
consistently and he did when we did put
too<00:01:09.360> far<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.780> dull<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.409> pipe<00:01:10.710> pressure

here's what this thing you say locate
the<00:01:34.240> blood<00:01:34.540> vessel<00:01:34.960> or<00:01:35.050> quick<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
the blood vessel or quick this is a

sensitive area of the nerves that should

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.030 
sensitive area of the nerves that should
be<00:01:37.720> avoided<00:01:38.170> which<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:38.980> messed<00:01:39.220> up<00:01:39.400> on<00:01:41.040> the

what is our promise the safety guard
helps<00:01:49.750> control<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.140> length<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.710> nail
