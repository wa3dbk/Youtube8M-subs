00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 curious are the mathematicians 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.929
 investigated the proportion of gold and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 found that it can be produced 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.390
 by a number is the number of gold was 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.609
 baptized with the Greek letter end and valley 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 approximately 1,6 180 the number of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 hours has to do with people's lives 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.789
 Let's continue our journey to know the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.790
 story of another leonardo leonardo 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.790
 fibonacci that lived around r 200 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.850
 leonardo was born in Pisa and was the son of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.789
 an Italian merchant called bonatti 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.610
 on account of the work of his father 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.620
 bonatti traveled much of northern africa 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 to the countries of the east 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 in these trips he had contact with 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 different methods of calculating 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 rebonatti realized that the form in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 arabic 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 the numbers we used today were more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
 practice to record quantities and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 make calculations that the European form in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 Which letters were used? 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.950
 Bonatti wrote a book in which 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.869
 explained the use of new numerals and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.540
 some calculation methods 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.210
 The book also contained a collection of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
 mathematical problems and among them a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.689
 problem about the reproduction of couples of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 rabbits 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.439
 we all know that the choice is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 reproduce rapidly and as fibonacci 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.810
 was mathematical rather than magical, and then 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.659
 next question a couple of rabbits 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.579
 they create once a month these 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.610
 take two months to grow 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.220
 this was a new couple of rabbits 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.060
 over 12 months while with him 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 will be generated from a single couple 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 many the ex five I'm going to kick January 40 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.869
 born in February but only me and god have 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.159
 to have a collaborator problems 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.039
 for math are not problems 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.800
 the reason for its existence a problem is 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.789
 a challenge to be solved a matter 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.920
 to be resolved 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.090
 Mathematics has a love affair with 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.220
 problem 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.260
 making the beads of rebonatti rabbits 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.480
 saw that in the first month we only have one 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.459
 pair of rabbits in the second month 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 we continue with a pair of rabbits in the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.379
 The third month is already two pairs in the fourth 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.549
 month are three pairs in the fifth month are 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:35.140
 five your assets are 81 71 are 13 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:38.819
 eighth 2011 is soon 34 the tenth is 55 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.019
 the 11th is 89 finally a year we will have 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.269
 144 pairs of rabbits 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.370
 The most interesting of all is that 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.739
 Solving this problem is a sequence 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.110
 of numbers that has a property 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.120
 curious from the third term each 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.200
 number obtained by the sum of the two 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.879
 previous 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:06.670
 takes a look two is equal to a zoom 3 is 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:11.079
 equal to two plus 15 equals 3 plus 28 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.870
 is equal to 5 + 3 13 equals 8 more 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.639
 five and so on indefinitely 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:22.540
 this sequence of numbers 1 2 3 5 8 13 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:25.109
 There you go. 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.919
 known as fibonacci sequence 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.690
 point here has a very curious fact 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.030
 if we take the sequence numbers of 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.340
 fibonacci thee from the second number 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.099
 and divide by the sequence of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.260
 fibonacci from the first number 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.079
 we will obtain values ​​that converge to the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.060
 number 1,680 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.060
 that is the number of gold 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.670
 more curious is that some plants 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.760
 and trees grow according to the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.829
 fibonacci sequence looks only at a few 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.290
 trees branch out according to the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:10.510
 fibonacci numbers underneath a branch 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.510
 then two but above 35 and so on. 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.420
 it will be coincidence 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.019
 probably not just coincidence 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.630
 that nature has some sequences of 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.729
 some numbers that are fixed in 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.009
 their bodies for example I can tell 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.020
 for you if a plant is or is not 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.270
 lily family even though this plant 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.389
 come from nepal japan i never have 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.009
 seen simply by knowing the number 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.919
 of petals the number of structures 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.840
 that this plant has so many 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.630
 exactly tell if nature knows 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.270
 count but no doubt it follows some 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.340
 some mathematical patterns within 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.740
 an organization that allows the 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.860
 with the biologist recognizes these 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.990
 standards and can use them to 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.600
 organize this nature in the way that the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.280
 people consider it more convenient 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.280
 inside that corja lives in a small 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.830
 mollusc called nautilus and is himself 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.630
 who builds their house as the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.210
 nautilus is growing it goes 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.030
 building a new room to live and 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.630
 each new room is larger than the previous one 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.840
 exactly in the proportion of the sequence of 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.840
 fibonacci 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.300
 mount spiral shell in a 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.810
 property matters if we take 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.120
 camera and amplified it. 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.450
 will fit perfectly into the camera 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.530
 the animal grows in the same 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.080
 proportion 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.510
 the golden ratio is the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.780
 impressive is that if all the chambers 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.750
 were increased in the same proportion 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.310
 all of them will fit into the 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.340
 day always and so on 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.340
 O
