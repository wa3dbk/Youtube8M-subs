00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.530 

there's<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.129> temperature<00:00:02.639> reading<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.210> cell

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
there's a temperature reading of my cell

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.680 
there's a temperature reading of my cell
right<00:00:03.840> now<00:00:04.020> it's<00:00:04.410> about<00:00:05.089> 80<00:00:06.089> degrees<00:00:06.509> outside

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
right now it's about 80 degrees outside

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.830 
right now it's about 80 degrees outside
I'm<00:00:07.410> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.550> point<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.970> laser<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.660> at

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
I'm going to point this laser right at

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.990 
I'm going to point this laser right at
the<00:00:09.990> cell<00:00:10.260> here

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.609 

it's<00:00:13.420> showing<00:00:15.720> about<00:00:16.720> 92<00:00:17.380> degrees<00:00:18.279> I<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:20.380> had

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
it's showing about 92 degrees I just had

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
it's showing about 92 degrees I just had
I<00:00:20.800> just<00:00:21.010> started<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.490> engine<00:00:21.640> up<00:00:22.029> so

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
I just started the engine up so

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:44.250 
I just started the engine up so
probably<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:26.900> 8590

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.470 

95<00:00:45.219> degrees

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.889 

that's<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.840> new<00:00:49.020> bubbler<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.829> other<00:00:50.010> one

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
that's my new bubbler the other one

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.680

didn't<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.760> good<00:00:53.760> resistance<00:00:54.150> on

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
didn't really have good resistance on

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.360 
didn't really have good resistance on
heat<00:00:55.290> so<00:00:56.129> it

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.240 

cracked<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.239> lot

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
cracked a lot

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.020 
cracked a lot
and<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.370> lot<00:01:03.550> of<00:01:03.580> problems<00:01:04.030> with<00:01:04.059> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and a lot of problems with that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so that's my new Butler hopefully it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
so that's my new Butler hopefully it
stands<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.299> made<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.630> of
