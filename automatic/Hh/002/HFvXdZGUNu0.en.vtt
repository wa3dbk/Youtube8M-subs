there's always disadvantage there's

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.100 
there's always disadvantage there's
tools<00:06:18.250> for<00:06:18.400> different<00:06:18.490> things<00:06:18.820> this<00:06:19.750> camera

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
tools for different things this camera

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.320 
tools for different things this camera
in<00:06:20.260> particular<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:21.310> has<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.520> screen<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.060> can

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
in particular it has a screen that can

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.550 
in particular it has a screen that can
flip<00:06:22.660> and<00:06:22.960> there's<00:06:23.200> definitely<00:06:23.320> other

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
flip and there's definitely other

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.020 
flip and there's definitely other
cameras<00:06:24.040> that<00:06:24.130> can<00:06:24.280> do<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.490> kind<00:06:24.700> of<00:06:24.730> stuff

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
cameras that can do that kind of stuff

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.680 
cameras that can do that kind of stuff
but<00:06:25.600> it<00:06:25.810> also<00:06:26.020> has<00:06:26.700> 4k<00:06:27.700> for<00:06:28.300> an<00:06:28.390> affordable

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
but it also has 4k for an affordable

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.540 
but it also has 4k for an affordable
price<00:06:29.140> it's<00:06:29.890> really<00:06:29.950> good<00:06:30.250> at<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.430> low

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
price it's really good at the low

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.610 
price it's really good at the low

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
good camera and works very similar to a

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.450

Canon DSLR camera so you for filling
familiar<00:06:37.060> with<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.240> 5d<00:06:37.630> 7d<00:06:37.870> and<00:06:38.290> also<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:38.740> big

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
familiar with the 5d 7d and also the big

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.500 
familiar with the 5d 7d and also the big
thing<00:06:39.040> too<00:06:39.220> is<00:06:39.460> it<00:06:39.580> already<00:06:39.760> comes<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:40.270> lens

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
thing too is it already comes to lens

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.960 
thing too is it already comes to lens
that<00:06:40.780> can<00:06:40.930> go<00:06:41.020> from<00:06:41.140> 24<00:06:41.560> millimeters<00:06:42.040> to<00:06:42.160> 240

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
that can go from 24 millimeters to 240

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.700 
that can go from 24 millimeters to 240
millimeters<00:06:43.420> so<00:06:43.900> that's<00:06:44.080> another<00:06:44.290> big<00:06:44.500> deal

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
millimeters so that's another big deal

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.290 
millimeters so that's another big deal
and<00:06:45.010> there's<00:06:45.190> the<00:06:45.310> great<00:06:45.580> camera<00:06:45.820> starting

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300
