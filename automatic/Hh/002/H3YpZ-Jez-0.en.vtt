00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
then on Thursday right the idea there is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
muscle while you improve your

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.300 
muscle while you improve your

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
performance in the sport but if your

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
performance in the sport but if your
main<00:01:38.520> goal<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:39.060> maybe<00:01:39.210> rugby<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.720> not

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
main goal because maybe rugby is not

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.179

like three sets of three depending on
the<00:02:29.020> exercise<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.770> phase<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.190> I'm<00:02:30.340> in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the exercise and the phase that I'm in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.440 
the exercise and the phase that I'm in
so<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:33.190> me<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.520> enough<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.970> build<00:02:34.150> some

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
so that for me is enough to build some

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.940 
so that for me is enough to build some
muscle<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.959> for<00:02:35.260> me<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.440> enough<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.770> maintain

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
muscle that for me is enough to maintain

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.380 
muscle that for me is enough to maintain
a<00:02:36.220> lot<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.580> strength<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> size<00:02:37.360> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
a lot of the strength and the size that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.790 
a lot of the strength and the size that
I've<00:02:37.690> built<00:02:37.870> up<00:02:38.050> over<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> course<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.739> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I've built up over the course of the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.009 
I've built up over the course of the
past<00:02:38.950> several<00:02:39.340> decades<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:40.150> training<00:02:40.900> with

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
past several decades of training with

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.560 
past several decades of training with
weights<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.700> think<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.060> most<00:02:43.150> people<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
weights and I think for most people that

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.030 
weights and I think for most people that
frequency<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.470> work<00:02:44.650> pretty<00:02:44.920> well

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
frequency is going to work pretty well

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.340 
frequency is going to work pretty well
if<00:02:45.610> you're<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.790> beginner<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.420> know<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.080> might

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
if you're a beginner you know you might

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.259 
if you're a beginner you know you might
not<00:02:47.500> even<00:02:47.590> need<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.890> much<00:02:48.190> frequency<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:49.150> if

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
not even need that much frequency but if

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.460 
not even need that much frequency but if
you're<00:02:49.360> an<00:02:49.450> intermediate<00:02:49.660> or<00:02:50.260> you're<00:02:50.380> an

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
you're an intermediate or you're an

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.080 
you're an intermediate or you're an
advanced<00:02:50.739> training<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.670> might<00:02:51.940> be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
advanced training that might be

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.150 
advanced training that might be
supportive<00:02:52.660> for<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.470> dude<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.980> real

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
supportive for you so dude the real

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.670 
supportive for you so dude the real
question<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:54.910> where's<00:02:55.630> your<00:02:55.840> priority<00:02:56.410> if

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
question is where's your priority if

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.940 
question is where's your priority if
it's<00:02:56.860> rugby<00:02:57.220> less<00:02:57.880> frequency<00:02:58.300> less<00:02:58.630> volume<00:02:59.230> if

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it's rugby less frequency less volume if

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.520 
it's rugby less frequency less volume if
it's<00:03:00.610> bodybuilding<00:03:01.269> then<00:03:01.900> frequency<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
it's bodybuilding then frequency and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.670 
it's bodybuilding then frequency and
volume<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:03.100> what<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> sport<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.330> all<00:03:04.510> about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
volume is what that sport is all about

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.620 
volume is what that sport is all about
hope<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.860> helps

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
hope that helps
