00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
bicarb soda and it just like expands it

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.799 
bicarb soda and it just like expands it
reacts<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.460> bubbles<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.150> super<00:00:12.480> cool<00:00:12.660> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
reacts and bubbles up it's super cool so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.180 
reacts and bubbles up it's super cool so
I'm<00:00:12.900> gonna<00:00:12.990> show<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.679> super

easy be gonna be careful cause it's hot

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:30.400 
easy be gonna be careful cause it's hot
so<00:00:16.260> uh<00:00:16.289> let's<00:00:16.710> make<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.070> honeycomb

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.530 

honey<00:00:31.410> sugar<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.670> little<00:00:32.820> bit<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.060> water<00:00:33.240> to<00:00:33.360> get

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
honey sugar a little bit of water to get

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.390 
honey sugar a little bit of water to get
the<00:00:33.660> caramel<00:00:33.930> started<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.010> bicarb

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
the caramel started and then some bicarb

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.100 
the caramel started and then some bicarb
and<00:00:35.490> that's<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:36.000> much<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.390> best<00:00:36.900> thing<00:00:37.080> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and that's pretty much it best thing to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.400 
and that's pretty much it best thing to
do<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.470> get<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.650> tray<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> non-stick<00:00:38.820> pan

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
do is get a tray or a non-stick pan

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.870 
do is get a tray or a non-stick pan
spray<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> hell<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.830> with<00:00:41.010> oil<00:00:41.190> lay<00:00:41.700> some

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
spray the hell out with oil lay some

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.550 
spray the hell out with oil lay some
paper<00:00:42.060> down<00:00:42.240> and<00:00:42.300> spray<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.630> again<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> that's

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
paper down and spray it again and that's

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.050 
paper down and spray it again and that's
what<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.830> honeycomb<00:00:44.130> is<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.460> -<00:00:44.580> I'm

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
what your honeycomb is going on - I'm

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.120 
what your honeycomb is going on - I'm
gonna<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:46.170> hopefully<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> turns

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
gonna use these and hopefully it turns

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.620 
gonna use these and hopefully it turns
out<00:00:47.370> hopefully<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> little<00:00:48.330> cool<00:00:48.510> little

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
out hopefully it is a little cool little

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.170 
out hopefully it is a little cool little
honeycomb<00:00:48.930> bites<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> first<00:00:50.790> step<00:00:50.970> is<00:00:51.030> just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
honeycomb bites so first step is just

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.390 
honeycomb bites so first step is just
spray<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> hell<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.470> just<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:53.309> an

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
spray the hell out of it so just with an

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.030 
spray the hell out of it so just with an
oil<00:00:53.550> spray<00:00:53.879> oil<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.470> yeah<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.830> could

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
oil spray oil you could yeah you could

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.880 
oil spray oil you could yeah you could
use<00:00:59.600> normal<00:01:00.600> oil<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> easier<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
use normal oil but it's a lot easier to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
use normal oil but it's a lot easier to
have<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> spray<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> oil<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.900> like<00:01:03.990> an

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have a spray can of oil you get like an

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.540 
have a spray can of oil you get like an
even<00:01:04.350> layer<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.190> heaps<00:01:05.400> in

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
even layer and you know you get heaps in

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.640 
even layer and you know you get heaps in
there<00:01:05.759> alright<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> once<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.960> tray<00:01:07.170> sprayed

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there alright so once your tray sprayed

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
there alright so once your tray sprayed
the<00:01:08.130> next<00:01:08.400> step<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.880> gonna<00:01:09.000> mix<00:01:09.150> our

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the next step is we're gonna mix our

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880 
the next step is we're gonna mix our
honey<00:01:09.630> our<00:01:09.869> sugar<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.259> our<00:01:10.440> water<00:01:10.710> together

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
honey our sugar and our water together

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
honey our sugar and our water together
and<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.340> caramel<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> whack<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and make caramel so whack it on the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.850 
and make caramel so whack it on the
stove<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.119> give<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.330> mix<00:01:15.860> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
stove and just give it a good mix you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350 
stove and just give it a good mix you
want<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.070> high<00:01:17.250> stove<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.940> wanna<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.300> you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
want a high stove so you wanna do is you

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.999 
want a high stove so you wanna do is you
want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> melt<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> sugar<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.800> want<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
want to melt the sugar and you want to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
want to melt the sugar and you want to
turn<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.310> until<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.610> combined<00:01:21.119> caramel<00:01:21.660> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
turn it all until I combined caramel the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
turn it all until I combined caramel the
liquids<00:01:22.440> evaporated<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.250> sugars

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
liquids evaporated and the sugars

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
liquids evaporated and the sugars
turning<00:01:24.149> into<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.750> camel<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.800> is<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
turning into like camel this is the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
turning into like camel this is the
tricky<00:01:26.310> part<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.970> honeycomb<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.840> don't

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
tricky part with honeycomb you don't

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
tricky part with honeycomb you don't
want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.440> too<00:01:28.710> far<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.580> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
want to take it too far because it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
want to take it too far because it's
gonna<00:01:29.970> burn<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.690> up<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> take

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
gonna burn a bit up but you get to take

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570 
gonna burn a bit up but you get to take
it<00:01:32.729> far<00:01:33.210> enough<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.680> sets<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.340> sets

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
it far enough that when it sets it sets

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.160 
it far enough that when it sets it sets
hard<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.210> no<00:01:36.330> liquid<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> sugar

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
hard like there's no liquid in the sugar

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370 
hard like there's no liquid in the sugar
so<00:01:38.120> we're<00:01:39.120> sort<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> almost<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> point<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so we're sort of almost at the point so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.420 
so we're sort of almost at the point so
you<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:40.710> your<00:01:40.770> senses<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.340> gonna

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you do use your senses you're gonna

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
you do use your senses you're gonna
smell<00:01:41.840> don't<00:01:42.840> touch<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:44.690> senses<00:01:45.690> as

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
smell don't touch it because senses as
