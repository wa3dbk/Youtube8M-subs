 has counted 30 mind 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.790
 Procedure 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.840
 the roll 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.560
 and we will be 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 master mouse 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.330
 they keep as it cuts the logs in 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.330
 boards 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.350
 same 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.409
 how many tables did the karate cat use for 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.409
 put together the house 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 eastern concentration 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.119
 and run 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.390
 let's see then the correct answer 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.770
 the pro roberto oriental has 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 answered correctly has been 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 Look 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.369
 very well he says to us years ago I need that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.799
 have a lot more concentration I think 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 they are somewhat tense as they will have noticed 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.030
 you have a brain at your side 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 that brain is just to release 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.170
 the tensions I'm going to ask you to give 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.210
 account of three take your brain with a 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.320
 hand and do all the attention of this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.179
 way they squeeze it like this to be able to release 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:13.560
 all tensions are fine to the 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 count of 33 21 pressures 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:22.770
 and they are fine yes ok because in the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.280
 next game we will be competing for 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.100
 50 points 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.010
 the other day I discovered that I had several 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.720
 watches and none worked but I 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.980
 like to recycle instead of the bike watch 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.980
 pay attention to the wheels 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.150
 which of these hours did not appear in my 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.989
 bikes watches 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.620
 and my time to choose this is a bit 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.970
 more complicated 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.970
 this means that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.050
 time is over let's see what it is 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.050
 the correct answer 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 I do not 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.670
 for you who are raising their arms 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.689
 doing well he has been the one who has 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.090
 answered correctly this game I think 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.579
 it's time to play for a score 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.150
 much higher who wants to earn 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.639
 100 points of keep your hands very well 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.139
 that the next game was going for whoever 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:35.859
 concentrated but quickly that beautiful 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:39.510
 day to rest in an ashram hear a 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.510
 moment is not a tree 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.049
 pay attention 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.050
 how many red birds were supported 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.630
 on the antlers of the deer 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.450
 and this is the time to choose the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.310
 correct answer with your arrows and in 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.420
 house can also play I have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.620
 understood that they also play 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.910
 bigger brothers against the more 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.000
 small and that I like to hear ready already 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.270

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.040
 they are too quiet I like it 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.040
 let's see what is the correct answer 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.259
