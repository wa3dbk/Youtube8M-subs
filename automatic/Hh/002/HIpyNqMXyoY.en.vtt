00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.779
 I have holger with me today hello people 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.210
 holger is the current lexicon and 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.689
 today it's about what's better 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.929
 the training gummy bear or 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.149
 chocolate 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.289
 what do you say to both sounds 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:33.480
 Tempting was the very first I both 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.580
 do not eat because I like it sweet 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.460
 yes, that's the key for me 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.780
 on gummi bears actually exist 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.310
 Almost 100 % sugar is the gelatin content and 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.960
 a little something is still in it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.090
 Chocolate is made of milk from cocoa 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.270
 from extra added sugar and from 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.560
 plant oils 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.130
 both have almost no floor 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.739
 proportion of 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.670
 so there are no bigger ones for us now 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.229
 make any kind of difference 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.409
 derstandard at work out chic looks yes 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.390
 in front of some protein and fast 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.979
 available carbohydrates and after me 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.719
 now the two of our two 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.520
 think open-minded alternatives 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.639
 I that she comes to the answer 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.270
 answer is that the gummi bear 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.509
 actually in the case the better 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.420
 alternative would be okay so it is too 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.619
 okay gummy bear after training too 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.240
 you would not or would not eat it 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.859
 recommend 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.429
 i would recommend i have people 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.479
 they have fixed 75 grams for me 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.990
 packet in the plan 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.829
 per pro workout as he after each 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.049
 training 75 grams holger is doing well 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.329
 Nutrition donors I would say 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.909
 which one is a great action 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.799
 to the people are looking forward alternatively 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.270
 is of course what you everywhere 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.679
 gets and very cheap from 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.609
 attitude is spits and vom 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.719
 buy price of flex for example 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.340
 then you can always like the 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.859
 sugared frosties take the plays 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.859
 after the training everything is no no 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.450
 so it really is big 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.709
 cool you can after the training 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.970
 also deliberately with sweets full blown 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.040
 I would say if you look at yourself 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.530
 really a bit upside down and one 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.140
 then the analyzes will send you a bit 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.910
 one finds on every supermarket 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.250
 every case an alternative the absolute 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.750
 is suitable for protein or without so 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.310
 In addition, you probably have to know 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.730
 eat or we would not get around 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 come 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.470
 it's always about the blood 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.910
 amino acid mirror again a bit 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.920
 raise the famous crisis with it 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.989
 again starts the one creates neither 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.090
 gummi bears still with conflicts again 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.700
 seriously something of these of these 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.030
 sugar treats ok everything clear coal in 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.209
 in front 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.430
