00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 my name is di galchansky today we 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.150
 we will learn to do back with you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.570
 somersault in one day let's say quite 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.779
 realistically and it is possible i learned to do 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.730
 back flip literally 2 hours from you 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.400
 it may take a little more or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 less time but the fact remains 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 his current occupation is to pump 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.490
 your psyche and accordingly make 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 this element is the matter is that physically 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 back flip is able to perform 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 absolutely any but not that disabled but 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.840
 there is a problem of the psyche, not every 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 mentally able to get over the case 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.870
 is that our brain is not used when we 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.180
 turn it upside down 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 the position incomprehensible to him therefore 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.989
 there will be difficulties and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.270
 initially we will 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.489
 in every possible way to wipe yourself and make websites 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.379
 not as it should be, I hope only 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 that you clearly motivated yourself and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 set a goal to make this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 element back flip nice to do 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.760
 water but since we have winter in the yard so 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 what are we going to do it in the snow 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.189
 that in some way even a big plus began 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.010
 where we begin our lesson is with 1 tab and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.960
 we will start back flip with a slide and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.479
 either from some road roll 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.000
 the type of 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.490
 you will say why i will just tell you everything 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.430
 because all this again rests on our 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.659
 the brain is the fact that immediately elevation 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.259
 you may not be able to do it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 like from the bench to me from the wall 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.180
 break through the brain protection will be easier on 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.100
 the hill now we put in that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.820
 the place where we have to do back 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.880
 somersault this roadside hope before 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.009
 this you have warmed up especially 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920
 paid much attention to the neck because 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.380
 may have to 1 and land on 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.759
 she and looked good landing place 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 now the basic knowledge you need 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.540
 will be remembered to make back 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.409
 first flip it first you need to sit down 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.289
 such a small chair 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.569
 like this, bend your legs a little 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.099
 we will perform up 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.800
 the second thing you need to remember is 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.959
 swing your hands for starters you 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.220
 advised that your hands go ahead 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.799
 head it will be a kind of insurance 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.640
 the third one is important it needs 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.360
 throw back your head to the first 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.730
 so that you have a backbend and 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.620
 second it will reduce your risk that you 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.420
 stick with your head on the way to the window and 4 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.019
 your jump should be carried out as if 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.030
 up and back and the most important thing is 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.890
 Of course not to close my eyes to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.440
 clear the space though it will be you 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.599
 smeared of course and do not open your mouth 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 so that when you land on 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.040
 don't bite your head off your tongue like that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.780
 moments you will have it anyway 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.090
 the most important thing will be needed from them during 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.040
 trickles understand that if you do 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.860
 flips right through the head then this 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.489
 will be less traumatic than if you 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.489
 will do 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:23.660
 and now I'll show you the right one 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.320
 performance 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.320
 approximately at this stage 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.350
 Now we will do back flips 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.720
 from a height not exceeding half a meter 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.540
 there we will need to teach you 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.300
 the fact that now with the flips we do with 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.520
 hills they slide and here you need 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.819
 will work until the end of the torque 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 so you can do it for sure and 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.770
 so that you do not have such errors that 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.989
 did you first need here again 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.620
 will we sing remember our beloved 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.690
 the train and accordingly the most important thing is 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.510
 go quickly with it up in it up so 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.630
 that you carefully select the seats 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.330
 where will you study 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.030
 so blass your brain didn't have time 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.500
 put a barrier and when you come here 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.940
 and so we both try to do somersaults 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.769
 If, however, the fear came again the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.390
 going back to the previous stage and 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.390
 start again hammering . 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.840
 this is the final crucial stage 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.950
 if you have reached this stage, then you have 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.160
 obviously have eggs 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.340
 but unfortunately for technical reasons 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.520
 about the stage I will have to explain to you at home 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.040
 Well, nothing essence I think you will understand 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.990
 so in this last stage we are now 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.050
 will do the same thing as in 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.450
 previous only our height 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.110
 the next obstacle will be from the meter and 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.730
 I will show you all this later 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.010
 here we must finally get ours 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.940
 long-awaited result is back flip 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.260
 and possibly overcome the next one 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.380
 the difficulty that we can here 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.380
 it is the height that comes here fear 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.870
 may arise he may lose 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.730
 whole raspberries 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.420
 so you need to get rid of it and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.370
 remember 3 rule the first is fast 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.850
 transition set up in it up about which he 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.450
 spoke and the second one should jump right away 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.430
 if you think more than half a minute then 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.480
 great chances are that you either 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.090
 don't jump at all 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.990
 either jump and not as they need 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.750
 jump and third is to remember that you 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.020
 trains do not forget that you train and drive 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.330
 on the rail and the most important thing about everything 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.350
 the rest you must forget besides the train 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.950
 your fears worked you did 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.310
 at least 5 times 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.190
 good back then you can go home 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.530
 warm up relax relax to 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.380
 your brain analyzed the whole situation and 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.240
 then after a couple of hours go back to 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.340
 the streets and from the last stages you 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 to repeat 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.240
 your site 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:23.580
 and so to make flips to us 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.370
 you need to tilt your head back and all 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.219
 anywhere else it does not turn around and 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.520
 the train and drive just back are presented 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:36.960
 you can even imagine what you are trying 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.639
 see your ass and of course to 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.150
 get on our feet we remember our 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.830
 standard base which was at the beginning and 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.729
 about 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.559
 smooth flow of one element 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.309
 but to end up with in my technique 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:54.199
 there is a side effect if you donâ€™t 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:57.020
 do physical activities either 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:01.400
 engaged in a very long time then the next 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:04.219
 day your whole body will be sick yes but 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.009
 believe it is worth it so wish 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:10.610
 good luck in mastering leave your 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:13.610
 pink on to video and with you was where 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:18.099
 Galchan saw video flips for one 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.099
 day not back flip
