okay<00:00:02.149> update<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.540> made<00:00:04.529> some<00:00:04.799> improvements

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay update here made some improvements

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay update here made some improvements
to<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.759> system<00:00:07.730> yet<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> solar<00:00:09.030> coming<00:00:09.599> in

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
to my system yet the solar coming in

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.290 
to my system yet the solar coming in
from<00:00:09.900> outside<00:00:10.080> on<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.620> left<00:00:11.070> left<00:00:11.820> hand<00:00:12.030> side

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
from outside on that left left hand side

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.769 
from outside on that left left hand side
conduit<00:00:13.099> runs<00:00:14.099> into<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:14.639> solar<00:00:15.560> disconnect

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
conduit runs into my solar disconnect

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.009 
conduit runs into my solar disconnect
then<00:00:18.800> goes<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:21.289> back<00:00:22.289> flex<00:00:22.680> max<00:00:22.980> 80<00:00:24.019> put

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
then goes into the back flex max 80 put

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
then goes into the back flex max 80 put
that<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.410> today<00:00:27.050> I've<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.260> those<00:00:28.439> cables

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that up today I've got those cables

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.430 
that up today I've got those cables
running<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:32.780> 24<00:00:33.780> volt<00:00:34.790> battery<00:00:35.790> bank

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
running down to my 24 volt battery bank

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.090 
running down to my 24 volt battery bank
so<00:00:37.440> I've<00:00:37.530> got<00:00:37.770> 12<00:00:38.750> 12<00:00:39.750> volt<00:00:40.050> 100<00:00:40.710> amp<00:00:40.860> hour

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so I've got 12 12 volt 100 amp hour

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.170 
so I've got 12 12 volt 100 amp hour
batteries<00:00:45.379> I've<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.829> wired<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.719> series

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
batteries I've got them wired in series

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.860 
batteries I've got them wired in series
each<00:00:52.340> two<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.520> wired<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.000> series<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.690> then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
each two are wired in series and then

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
each two are wired in series and then
each<00:00:55.770> two<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.850> wired<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.390> parallel<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.670> I've

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
each two are wired in parallel so I've

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.899 
each two are wired in parallel so I've
got<00:01:02.539> 24<00:01:03.539> volts<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:05.010> 630<00:01:05.939> amp<00:01:06.210> hours<00:01:06.600> total

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
got 24 volts about 630 amp hours total

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.230 
got 24 volts about 630 amp hours total
I've<00:01:08.909> got<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.330> running<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:11.900> 300<00:01:12.900> amp

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
I've got that running up to my 300 amp

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.920 
I've got that running up to my 300 amp
battery<00:01:15.240> disconnect<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.330> then<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
battery disconnect here and then that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
battery disconnect here and then that
runs<00:01:19.320> into<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.340> Ames<00:01:22.159> 3000<00:01:23.159> watt<00:01:23.340> pure<00:01:23.759> sine

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

items<00:01:29.130> plugged<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.070> over

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
items plugged in there and then over

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
items plugged in there and then over
here<00:01:35.060> now<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.630> showing<00:01:36.930> my

here now you can see it's showing my

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.399 
here now you can see it's showing my
battery<00:01:37.409> charge<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.040> 26<00:01:38.700> moulds<00:01:39.409> they've

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
battery charge I'm at 26 moulds they've

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
battery charge I'm at 26 moulds they've
got<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> hard<00:01:40.890> wired<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.890> yellow<00:01:44.159> wire<00:01:44.460> runs

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
got a hard wired that yellow wire runs

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.039 
got a hard wired that yellow wire runs
to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> panel<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:51.049> just

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to the panel and then right now I just

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.600 
to the panel and then right now I just
have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> 20<00:01:53.009> amp<00:01:53.159> breakers<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> are<00:01:54.119> running

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
have to 20 amp breakers that are running

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.109 
have to 20 amp breakers that are running
different<00:01:56.610> outlets<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:58.820> I'll<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.939> adding

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
different outlets and I'll be adding

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.120 
different outlets and I'll be adding
more<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.620 

as<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:09.060> act<00:02:09.360> right<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.170> 500<00:02:10.860> watts

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
as I act right now I only have 500 watts

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.760 
as I act right now I only have 500 watts
to<00:02:12.630> 250<00:02:13.500> watt<00:02:13.680> panels<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.530> with<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> new

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
to 250 watt panels but with the new

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.950 
to 250 watt panels but with the new
controller<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.830> 24<00:02:20.400> volt<00:02:20.430> system<00:02:21.210> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
controller here in a 24 volt system the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.160 
controller here in a 24 volt system the
Outback<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:22.590> handle<00:02:23.840> 2,000<00:02:24.840> watts<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:27.170> I'll

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
Outback can handle 2,000 watts so I'll

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.910 
Outback can handle 2,000 watts so I'll
probably<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.830> eight<00:02:29.100> panels<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.850> total

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
probably have eight panels in total

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.070 
probably have eight panels in total
running<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.370> charge<00:02:32.760> controller

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.150 

and<00:02:37.130> that'll<00:02:38.130> that'll<00:02:38.430> bump<00:02:38.820> max<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.330> out

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and that'll that'll bump max it out

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.949 
and that'll that'll bump max it out
before<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> add<00:02:41.340> any<00:02:41.520> more<00:02:41.700> panels<00:02:42.420> after<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
before I add any more panels after that

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.010 
before I add any more panels after that
I'll<00:02:43.140> probably<00:02:43.730> want<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.850> expand<00:02:45.420> my<00:02:45.510> battery

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
I'll probably want to expand my battery

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.300 
I'll probably want to expand my battery
bank<00:02:47.570> but<00:02:49.610> something<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> work<00:02:50.820> work<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.480> now

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
volt bank and then it also plugs into a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.430 
volt bank and then it also plugs into a
AC<00:03:22.380> outlet<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> wind<00:03:25.050> isn't

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
AC outlet so when the wind isn't

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.940 
AC outlet so when the wind isn't
generating<00:03:26.160> enough<00:03:26.400> power<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.170> AC<00:03:28.170> picks<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
generating enough power the AC picks it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.290 
generating enough power the AC picks it
up<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.250> now<00:03:30.950> I'll<00:03:31.950> probably<00:03:32.280> add<00:03:32.610> one<00:03:32.910> solar

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
up for now I'll probably add one solar

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.160 
up for now I'll probably add one solar
panel<00:03:33.840> back<00:03:34.080> into<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> zan<00:03:34.769> tracks<00:03:35.130> two<00:03:36.170> so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
panel back into the zan tracks two so

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.710 
panel back into the zan tracks two so
that<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.350> don't<00:03:37.440> need<00:03:37.769> any<00:03:37.920> AC<00:03:38.269> charge<00:03:39.269> they<00:03:39.540> can

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that I don't need any AC charge they can

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.420 
that I don't need any AC charge they can
just<00:03:39.870> run<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.080> right<00:03:40.560> off<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.890> solar<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
just run it right off the solar in the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
just run it right off the solar in the
wind

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
wind

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.090 
wind
but<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:44.010> long<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.280> give<00:03:44.370> an<00:03:44.489> update<00:03:45.860> got<00:03:46.860> some

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
but it's long to give an update got some

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.990 
but it's long to give an update got some
new<00:03:47.250> toys<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.780> got<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:48.930> hooked<00:03:49.080> up<00:03:49.320> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
new toys and got them hooked up and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.190 
new toys and got them hooked up and
everything's<00:03:51.000> working<00:03:51.090> good<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> right<00:03:54.860> now

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
everything's working good so right now

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.750 
everything's working good so right now
one<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.290> these<00:03:58.410> panel<00:03:59.540> fuses<00:04:00.540> runs<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.170> my

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
one of these panel fuses runs to my

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.060 
one of these panel fuses runs to my
television<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:03.989> running<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.380> TV<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.010> a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
television so I'm running a TV and a

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.400 
television so I'm running a TV and a
direct

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.240 

satellite<00:04:09.340> receiver<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.420> DVD<00:04:10.840> player<00:04:11.250> off

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
satellite receiver and a DVD player off

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.290 
satellite receiver and a DVD player off
of<00:04:12.490> one<00:04:12.610> outlet<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.180> then<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.640> other<00:04:15.790> outlet

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
of one outlet and then the other outlet

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.170 
of one outlet and then the other outlet
is<00:04:18.300> just<00:04:19.300> an<00:04:19.510> emergency<00:04:19.780> backup<00:04:20.440> light<00:04:21.180> so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
is just an emergency backup light so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.870 
is just an emergency backup light so
I'll<00:04:22.860> kind<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.040> play<00:04:24.220> with<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.700> system<00:04:25.600> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
I'll kind of play with this system and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.390 
I'll kind of play with this system and
see<00:04:27.880> how<00:04:28.030> much<00:04:28.240> more<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.600> can<00:04:28.780> add<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.440> like

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
see how much more I can add to that like

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.580 
see how much more I can add to that like
