00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
put on the wall and this is about

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.920 
put on the wall and this is about
concepts<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.020> green<00:00:58.500> yellow<00:00:58.980> very<00:00:59.579> very<00:01:00.090> fresh

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.789 

the<00:01:03.930> yellow<00:01:04.170> art<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.979> long<00:01:05.939> time<00:01:06.180> ago<00:01:06.390> dish

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
the yellow art is a long time ago dish

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
the yellow art is a long time ago dish
where<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> replace<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
where I just try to replace with the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.790 
where I just try to replace with the
final<00:01:10.650> ingredient

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
final ingredient

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.190 
final ingredient
and<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.340> concept<00:01:12.820> behind<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.780> have<00:01:13.990> an

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
and the concept behind is to have an

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.110 
and the concept behind is to have an
interjection<00:01:14.860> breathing<00:01:15.610> through<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
interjection breathing through the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.030 
interjection breathing through the
guests<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.320> guests<00:01:17.650> can<00:01:17.680> really

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
guests so the guests can really

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.400 
guests so the guests can really
experience<00:01:18.520> how<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.210> make<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.750> dessert<00:01:20.080> and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
experience how you make it a dessert and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.320 
experience how you make it a dessert and
the<00:01:20.650> fun<00:01:20.890> part<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.460> don't<00:01:21.580> use<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:21.790> plane<00:01:22.150> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
the fun part you don't use a plane the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570 
the fun part you don't use a plane the
place<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.810> too<00:01:23.080> small<00:01:23.110> right<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:24.310> here<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.520> a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
place is too small right so here is a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.360 
place is too small right so here is a
table<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.510> table<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.140> big<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.130> really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
table the table is so big you can really

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.910 
table the table is so big you can really
play<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:28.330> then<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.720> way<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.110> first<00:01:29.320> part<00:01:29.680> is

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
play and then the way the first part is

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.730 
play and then the way the first part is
the<00:01:29.950> sauce<00:01:30.370> so<00:01:31.360> it's<00:01:31.480> like<00:01:31.660> a<00:01:31.690> painting<00:01:32.110> then

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
the sauce so it's like a painting then

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.290 
the sauce so it's like a painting then
we<00:01:32.860> start<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.220> put<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.430> lot<00:01:33.640> ingredient<00:01:34.180> the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
we start to put a lot ingredient the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.500 
we start to put a lot ingredient the
chocolate<00:01:34.780> mousse<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.410> then<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:37.150> guests

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
chocolate mousse and then the guests

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.210 
chocolate mousse and then the guests
really<00:01:37.840> see<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.230> only<00:01:38.380> ingredient<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.070> you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
really see the only ingredient when you

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.970 
really see the only ingredient when you
talk<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.580> explain<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.870> guests<00:01:41.110> feel<00:01:41.350> excited
