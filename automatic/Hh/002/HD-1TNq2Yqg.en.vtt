00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.650
 transform experience 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.640
 'Transformers' started with a line of toys 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.839
 made by Japanese will stop 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.280
 composed of eggs 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.760
 following japan 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.009
 turning cars planes 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.380
 other objects 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.849
 but it was with a cartoon beyond the comics and the Christmas guerrillas 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.649
 gained popularity 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.869
 becoming another element of pop culture of the 80's 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.220
 in the movie wave 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.350
 'transformers' wins a new medium quality wine 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.730
 The saddest thing to give me is the impression of a missed opportunity. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 after the same formula game that many of them famous 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.420
 but it was all to lose 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 with a low flow control 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.830
 to transform this two-year blend with exploratory vehicle participation 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.540
 everything is very fast and noisy as in the movie and this explosive action is yours 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.380
 main quality 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.590
 but the way locked in took the ruin experience 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 the premise is the same as the cinema more than the script minimum is different 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.230
 he counts on the battle between the transformations of good and evil 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.220
 represented by the autobots and losses of 7 points 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.520
 in general 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.570
 or it complemented the feature but the narrative changes when it comes to 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 situations that happen in the cinema 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.160
 probably not to spoil the surprise 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.390
 the player can choose the autobots episodes 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.970
 other 17 points 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.659
 the beginning comes to remember that anderson author 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.689
 but it's just a facade 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.359
 because although there is freedom the player has access to the small part of the forest for 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.210
 paths 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.909
 in this exploration the intention is to find a living in secrets 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.620
 We see that we activate the main missions whose 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.570
 goals vary little 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.260
 almost everything is limited to pursuing enemies 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.219
 revolted 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.649
 destroy certain structures or get somewhere in time 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.579
 the alternative missions are even less inspired 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.310
 each robot has two firearms neco did melee 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.019
 which generate up to a sequence of three attacks 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.769
 weapons are relatively powerful 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.789
 but almost do not serve to inflict damage to enemies 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.839
 the way is to count on the hands repeatedly using the same blow 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.070
 other opponents if they want you to throw objects 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.419
 and there is no shortage 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.040
 some situations become ridiculous 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.600
 with one of the buildings that practically closed 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.449
 1 as little as possible 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.820
 the Celtic completes with the arrival of human forces 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.389
 with the shooting all over the place 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.199
 with the touch of a button the characters have become the most varied 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.219
 vehicles 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.199
 destruction speed remains 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.909
 the traffic eliminated with a single shot them 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.950
 in humanoid form the controls do not convince the stumbling style until it can 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.709
 be intent on trying to get the impression of controlling machines 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.949
 gigantic 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.819
 but the bad experience 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.010
 mainly in relation to the cane 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.079
 that usually hide the bad angles 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.799
 the autobots mission is less fun than that of the evil transformers 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.040
 a game based on destruction 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.280
 the player is penalized if he causes damage to humans as well 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.129
 goals become even more repetitive 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.069
 for the class of great for him 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.790
 the decepticons get rid of these moorings 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.899
 because destruction as a goal 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:39.419
 even with two campaigns the game is short and for about six hours 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.480
 I did there to collect stories 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.559
 but this does not increase the life span very much 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.699
 the edition for export 360 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.700
 is the one that has the best look 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.290
 followed closely by playstation 3 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.329
 which has less light effects 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.919
 the following item 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.089
 and asks mainly in the details of the scenarios 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.959
 and finally 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.589
 playstation 2 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.449
 the quality of the front pass as always 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.100
 of computer power 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.369
 and especially the video card 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.649
 but 'transformers' is not a very light game 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:18.659
 in the control game playstation 3 the successor to command the airplanes 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.639
 gestures can be made to activate the blows 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:28.860
 the sound department stand out dubbing the main actors of the film 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.889
 reprise their roles 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.500
 and the original voices of great for him and deny trunk 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.310
 it's written in english 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.610
 sr 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.129
 to herrera 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.139
 down 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.800
 Teixeira 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.430
 the impression one has is to transform this idea 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 is that the game could be much better 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.729
 mechanical history are races 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.159
 but it has a noise and thoughtless action 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:02.139
 however the controls locked the woman an experience maybe these defects 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.539
 do not bother fans more who is looking for a good action game 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.629
 you should expect something more consistent
