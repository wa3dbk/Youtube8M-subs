00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
probably gonna need to do a bit of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.700 
probably gonna need to do a bit of
damage<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.530> surgery<00:00:43.980> yes<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> bit

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
damage all right the surgery yes a bit

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.990 
damage all right the surgery yes a bit
just<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> open<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> centre<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> bushes

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
just to open up the centre of the bushes

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420 
just to open up the centre of the bushes
and<00:00:48.030> allowance<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> light<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and allowance of light in there so that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.560 
and allowance of light in there so that
you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> build<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you know you don't get to build up with

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
you know you don't get to build up with
pests<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> diseases<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.340> actually

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
pests and diseases and it's actually

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
pests and diseases and it's actually
easier<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> pick<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> fruit<00:00:54.360> though<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
easier to pick the fruit though at the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
easier to pick the fruit though at the
same<00:00:55.710> time<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> prune

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
same time you know you want to prune

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779

spots<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.509> spread<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
spots on that which can then spread to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.730 
spots on that which can then spread to
the<00:01:49.049> whole<00:01:49.170> bush<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> what<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> do

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the whole bush so what you want to do

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.760 
the whole bush so what you want to do
basically<00:01:56.180> yeah<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
basically yeah well you it just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.200 
basically yeah well you it just
eventually<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> give<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> bush

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
eventually don't want to give the bush

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
eventually don't want to give the bush
too<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.229> shock<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.460> about<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
too much for shock you can take about a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.830 
too much for shock you can take about a
third<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.619> every

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
third out every

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
third out every
if<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.200> need<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.470> do<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:05.979> drastically

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
if you need to do it really drastically

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.889 
if you need to do it really drastically
but<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.310> summer<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:10.479> know<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
but in the summer you know that the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.900 
but in the summer you know that the
ideal<00:02:11.170> way<00:02:11.380> really<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.830> pick<00:02:12.069> them<00:02:12.310> which<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.849> do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
ideal way really to pick them which I do

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880 
ideal way really to pick them which I do
it's<00:02:13.510> much<00:02:13.720> easier<00:02:14.080> than<00:02:14.110> trying<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.500> remember

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
it's much easier than trying to remember

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.410 
it's much easier than trying to remember
to<00:02:15.220> do<00:02:15.340> something<00:02:15.670> twice<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:16.030> year<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.239> saves

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to do something twice a year and saves

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.930 
to do something twice a year and saves
an<00:02:16.569> awful<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:16.989> time<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.730> just

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
an awful lot of time is actually to just

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.270 
an awful lot of time is actually to just
prune<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.900> branches<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:21.099> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
prune the branches out that have the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.610 
prune the branches out that have the
most<00:02:21.430> fruit<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:23.050> take<00:02:23.349> them<00:02:23.500> inside

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
most fruit on and then take them inside

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.500 
most fruit on and then take them inside

sort of totally denuding the bush you've

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.990 
sort of totally denuding the bush you've
got<00:02:38.140> lots<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.530> nice<00:02:38.739> new<00:02:39.340> shoots<00:02:39.610> coming<00:02:39.880> up

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
got lots of nice new shoots coming up

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.520 
got lots of nice new shoots coming up
here<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.330> they've<00:02:40.480> always<00:02:40.630> obviously<00:02:41.170> been<00:02:41.410> in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
here so they've always obviously been in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.590 
here so they've always obviously been in
a<00:02:41.650> fed<00:02:42.220> really<00:02:42.519> well<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:42.850> some<00:02:43.030> nice<00:02:43.180> compost

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
a fed really well with some nice compost

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.710 
a fed really well with some nice compost
and<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.799> want<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.250> nip<00:02:45.430> over<00:02:45.580> open<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
and you want to nip over open up the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320 
and you want to nip over open up the
center<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> bush<00:02:47.549> take<00:02:48.549> out<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> few<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
center of the bush take out a few of the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.820 
center of the bush take out a few of the
weaker<00:02:49.630> ones<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.140> might<00:02:50.319> be<00:02:50.500> sort<00:02:50.680> of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
weaker ones that might be sort of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.789 
weaker ones that might be sort of
growing<00:02:51.340> across<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:53.019> crowding<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
growing across and just crowding in the

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.690 
growing across and just crowding in the
middle<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.989> think<00:02:59.349> what<00:03:00.190> we'll<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.489> first

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
middle there I think what we'll do first

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.520 
middle there I think what we'll do first
let's<00:03:00.880> take<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.180> any<00:03:01.480> dead<00:03:01.720> diseas'd

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
let's take out any dead diseas'd

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.680 
let's take out any dead diseas'd
all<00:03:02.680> crowding<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.340> crossing<00:03:03.819> branches<00:03:04.360> oh

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
all crowding and crossing branches oh

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.210 
all crowding and crossing branches oh
and<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:04.989> one<00:03:05.319> here<00:03:05.560> which<00:03:05.739> really<00:03:06.010> is

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and this is one here which really is

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.920 
and this is one here which really is
going<00:03:06.430> nowhere<00:03:06.940> yeah<00:03:07.180> that's<00:03:07.480> actually<00:03:07.630> going

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
going nowhere yeah that's actually going

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.509 
going nowhere yeah that's actually going
nowhere<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.500> what<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.739> can<00:03:08.980> do<00:03:09.130> since<00:03:09.370> a

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
nowhere but what you can do since a

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.430 
nowhere but what you can do since a
little<00:03:09.640> bud<00:03:09.880> down<00:03:10.570> here<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.109> bottom

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
little bud down here at the bottom

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.430 
little bud down here at the bottom
yeah<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.579> just<00:03:13.510> prune<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.900> back<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.100> there

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
yeah and just prune that back to there

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.580 
yeah and just prune that back to there
yeah<00:03:20.160> yeah<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.430> think<00:03:21.880> which<00:03:22.840> possibly<00:03:23.140> ought

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
yeah yeah I think which possibly ought

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.809 
yeah yeah I think which possibly ought
to<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.100> pruned<00:03:24.340> back<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:25.030> little<00:03:25.870> bit<00:03:26.819> really

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
to be pruned back a little bit really

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.819 
to be pruned back a little bit really
because<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:28.480> crowding<00:03:29.140> pull<00:03:29.739> it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
because it's actually crowding pull it

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.830 
because it's actually crowding pull it
back<00:03:30.040> crowding<00:03:30.549> yeah<00:03:30.819> at<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.150> center<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
back crowding yeah at the center of the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.539 
back crowding yeah at the center of the
bush<00:03:31.989> oh<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.440> lovely<00:03:32.799> big<00:03:32.980> strong<00:03:33.280> shoot

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
bush oh it's a lovely big strong shoot

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.509 
bush oh it's a lovely big strong shoot
but<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:33.910> actually<00:03:34.209> you've<00:03:34.450> got<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:35.190> bud<00:03:36.190> there

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
but it's actually you've got a bud there

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.830 
but it's actually you've got a bud there
but<00:03:36.670> that's<00:03:36.819> growing<00:03:37.060> into<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.450> middle<00:03:37.780> of

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
but that's growing into the middle of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.360 
but that's growing into the middle of
the<00:03:37.930> bush<00:03:38.079> which<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.410> don't<00:03:38.620> want<00:03:38.889> on<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.130> bud

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the bush which you don't want on a bud

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.879 
the bush which you don't want on a bud
going<00:03:39.609> else<00:03:39.819> yes<00:03:40.239> I'm<00:03:40.840> proving<00:03:41.319> as<00:03:41.410> close<00:03:41.650> to

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
going else yes I'm proving as close to

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.780 
going else yes I'm proving as close to
the<00:03:42.010> bed<00:03:42.160> as<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:44.230> possible<00:03:44.889> sloping

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the bed as you can if possible sloping

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.849 
the bed as you can if possible sloping
it<00:03:45.910> slightly<00:03:46.209> away<00:03:46.690> from<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.019> bud<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.769> you

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
it slightly away from the bud so you

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.979 
it slightly away from the bud so you
don't<00:03:48.040> get<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.190> collection<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.760> water<00:03:48.989> actually

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
don't get a collection of water actually

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.640 
don't get a collection of water actually
in<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.290> top<00:03:52.530> again<00:03:53.530> here

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
in the top again here

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.670 
in the top again here
I<00:03:54.709> would<00:03:55.280> be<00:03:55.400> tempted<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.819> take<00:03:56.090> out<00:03:56.329> this<00:03:56.680> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
I would be tempted to take out this this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.509 
I would be tempted to take out this this
one<00:03:57.950> here<00:03:58.840> sorry<00:03:59.840> about<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.110> travel<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.560> don't

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
one here sorry about this travel I don't

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.929 
one here sorry about this travel I don't
feel<00:04:01.849> any<00:04:02.620> baby<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:05.890> again<00:04:06.890> there's<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.549> little

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
feel any baby but again there's a little

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.520 
feel any baby but again there's a little
bug<00:04:08.180> which<00:04:08.360> will<00:04:08.510> grow<00:04:08.720> out<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:09.079> way<00:04:09.290> there's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
bug which will grow out this way there's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.039 
bug which will grow out this way there's
a<00:04:09.590> gap<00:04:09.769> here<00:04:09.799> so<00:04:10.280> hopefully<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.180> bud<00:04:11.510> will

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
a gap here so hopefully that bud will

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.930 
a gap here so hopefully that bud will
grab<00:04:12.290> nicely<00:04:13.930> smaller<00:04:14.930> seconds<00:04:15.409> notice<00:04:15.680> here

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
grab nicely smaller seconds notice here

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.240 
grab nicely smaller seconds notice here
this<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.000> actually<00:04:17.660> better<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:18.739> doing<00:04:19.009> this

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
this is actually better for doing this

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.029 
this is actually better for doing this
job<00:04:19.609> smaller<00:04:20.209> yeah<00:04:20.539> this<00:04:21.289> is<00:04:21.470> growing<00:04:21.709> right

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
job smaller yeah this is growing right

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.379 
job smaller yeah this is growing right
