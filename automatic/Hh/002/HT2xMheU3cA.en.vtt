00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.260
 hello youtube galera 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.320
 this is the first video of a series of 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.930
 videos that aims to spread 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.490
 some knowledge about the area of 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.900
 development of games and games 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.930
 digital 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.270
 I'm not going to talk, it's just about the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.150
 programming modeling more about the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.790
 development in general since it is and how 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.850
 these ideas until your 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.980
 publication, that is, we will go through 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.070
 almost all areas of development 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.110
 used issues such as 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.820
 3d modeling documentation routing 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.400
 programming among others 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.500
 I hope that by the end of the series we have 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.489
 a final project ready to be 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.009
 published 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.460
 In this first video I will only speak 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.850
 about the content that will be passed 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.729
 this content was divided into 15 modules 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.820
 which is the documentation that is the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.080
 game on paper is a document and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.570
 details that aims to ensure 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.360
 the functionality of the game clearly 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.909
 for all participants throughout 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 team can work effectively 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.680
 in this game 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.460
 the second module introducing the design of 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.979
 games 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.500
 In this mode we will check some of the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.729
 main platforms available in the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.619
 Marketplace 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.930
 Let's also see the ones we're going to use 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.320
 during the course 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 we will see some professionals in the area and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.470
 the game styles so that 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.470
 can we see what kind of game 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.770
 adapts better to our concept in the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.140
 third module let's create stories 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.600
 in this module we will work with 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.090
 how to write a script 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.570
 for digital games 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.150
 then we go where you 3d modeling 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.030
 we want our scenarios and our 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.920
 characters and objects that make up the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.500
 scene of our game 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.010
 after that we will move on to the sculpture 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.250
 where we will create the wealth of 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.790
 details of our 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.070
 characters the models made from 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.640
 of digital sculpture will not be 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.040
 used in the game but will be important 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.070
 because they will serve as a basis for 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.620
 texturizing and digital painting 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:52.640
 from there we go to India where 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.530
 let's export all our models 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.040
 for indiani that will be used to 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.830
 really develop the game after 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.630
 Okay, we're going to ride this ride. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.690
 complete process to create a 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.610
 characters during the steps are created 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.550
 placed our 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.320
 characters thus allowing the animation 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.160
 of the mesh is to the next module module 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.760
 10 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.400
 we will create the animation for the game with the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.730
 applied in this module. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.590
 we can animate our characters 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.640
 our models and scenarios in this 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.549
 time 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.540
 we will create olÃ© the design that is the captain 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:44.040
 11 where we will separate our game in 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.470
 levels from then on we will have a new 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.320
 contact with the eni will be with the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.130
 the purpose of creating the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.790
 give life and control to our game 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.410
 then in module 13 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:05.010
 Let's create ours - and finally let's 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.110
 use sound effects to give the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.489
 climate change and ensure a better 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.579
 of game 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.660
 By the end we will test our game and 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.709
 published on the web is this is the content 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.040
 of course 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.590
 I hope you like it if you like it or

 click the port share with 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.390

 leave your comment so that we can 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.830
 improve our channel to make the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.830
 registration just access 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:40.469

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.710
 video courses will be available here 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:47.099
 on the youtube channel but some 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.979
 content such as files and other 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.979
 publications will be released only for 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.259
