00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.370
 channel 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.610
 in this small and uncomplicated wizard 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 class, I'll show you how to make beautiful 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.450
 pies 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 I will use his friends in my work 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.130
 polymer clay beige and red 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.650
 colors 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.820
 blades to cut plastic dry 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.820
 paste for training a brush and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 glossy 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 pins will be useful to those who want from you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.900
 tutus make suspension 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.930
 Good knead plastic before work 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.290
 so that it becomes more plastic and shares 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.320
 I form it into a long sausage and cut it off 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.960
 3 approximately equal parts quantity 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 pieces cut off is the number of future 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 pies I take one of the feelings and roll 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 from her cylinder laid 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.079
 and with the edges right hands form the volume 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 similar to the real horn after which 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.440
 I cut a small piece of plastic 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.560
 we roll out of it two thin thin 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.170
 sausages and these sausages I twist 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 among themselves to make such a twisted 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 pigtail this twisted flagellum this twisted 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 pigtail I put right on top of the pie 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.100
 and cut off the sides of this 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 pigtails 1 patty ready second and third 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.550
 I will do exactly the same principle 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.009
 exactly the same when all three 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.280
 patty ready to take a dry pastel and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.509
 I paint her taste with a blade and this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 dust brush I tint all the cakes 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.009
 note that this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.399
 pies usually the most crisp blush 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.310
 and these are the upper and lower parts as well on the sides 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.520
 pies are lighter so on the sides 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.239
 tinted need weaker tinted 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 pies 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.229
 remain lying to the side and I proceed to 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.660
 girlfriends 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.330
 I take a piece of plastic form from it 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.810
 sausage and cut off several equal 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.540
 parts 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.760
 from all parts right in your palms 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.849
 separately I roll balls 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.500
 and then the flip side of the brush in 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.440
 each ball 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.390
 I push a hole but not through 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 because if you push right through 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.480
 get a donut and thanks to that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.489
 the pressure ball is a little flattened out and 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.310
 cheesecake form is obtained 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.360
 I take a sheet of pastel dust and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.140
 toning 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.180
 these future cheesecakes from all sides 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.280
 just like the top pies 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.370
 and the bottom of the cheesecakes toned 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.130
 will be stronger than the side parts I take 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.680
 red plastic kneading well and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.040
 katar from it thin thin 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 sausage and this thin sausage cut 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.319
 into many small parts is the future 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.010
 berries because cheesecakes I will have with 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.290
 berries 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 particles do not have to be 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.239
 absolutely equal and the same because 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.820
 berries in nature are also found 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.260
 absolutely different sizes therefore 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.750
 specifically in this case is not necessary 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.799
 strive to do exactly the same 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.440
 little balls berries and when berries 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.560
 cooking with a toothpick I fill 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.859
 dredging in small cheesecakes and berries 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.410
 red balls here already depends on 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.540
 of your taste you can put berries to 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.299
 it is possible to put more with a hill 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.910
 smaller can make different berries 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.410
 for example black and red it can be 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.310
 currants and blueberries 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.200
 or can it be strawberry strawberries 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.120
 be guided by your taste 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.190
 from this baking I will make small 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.110
 so that later it was possible 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.810
 use in some further 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.480
 works for example in the bracelet so in 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 I have not baked the parts yet 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.730
 metal pins 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.299
 and all the pies and cheesecakes bake half an hour 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.540
 at 110 degrees as needed 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:17.060
 bake polymer clay fimo 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.540
 take out the pies from the oven and paste 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.150
 pins so that they no longer fall out 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.500
 round pliers pull out a screw makaev glue and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.510
 insert the pin back glossy varnish 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.840
 cover the patties and tarts on top 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:37.389
 as if they were smeared with egg or butter 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.389
 what it looks like in the present baking 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.650
 the varnish dries in about 15 minutes and after 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.080
 of this i get cute details which 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.910
 can be used as 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 miniature for dollhouse and in 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.910
 As some submissions 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.340
 further work 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.190
 I wish you creative success and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.470
 inspiration write your comments 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.360
