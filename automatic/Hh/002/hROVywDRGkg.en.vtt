00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:04.375
"I wonder where my heart's gone."

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:08.000
"It was right here. Where is it?"

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:12.500
"If you feel dizzy
or if your heart sinks."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.458
"Come, dear. Come to me."

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:19.583
"Why do you worry?
Why do you worry?"

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.000
"My friend is the groom."

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:24.625
"And flowers are in bloom."

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:30.000
"Everyone pray together
that I also get married."

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.500
A bus conductor...Badruddin
Jamaluddin Kazi..

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.667
..who in future became an legendary
actor in the Hindi film industry.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.208
He presented a new genre
of comedy in Hindi films.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.625
Mohammad Rafi sang songs for him.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:46.333
O.P. Nayyar composed songs for him.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.833
Guru Dutt used to
change his script..

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.583
..when he used to work in his films.

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.750
We're talking about Johny Walker.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.333
"I wonder where my heart's gone."

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.250
"It was right here. Where is it?"

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.083
"It must have fallen for someone."

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.958
"It must have got
scared by big eyes."

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.375
Johny Walker's real name
was Badruddin Jamaluddin Kazi.

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:15.458
He was born in Indore.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.583
On one hand he belonged
to big family of 15 members.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.208
On other hand,
there was poverty and starvation.

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.542
And this was the
time when Badruddin..

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.292
..tried his hand at many jobs.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:30.208
Bombay Electric Supply
and Transport i.e. BEST..

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.583
..this was where Johyny
Walker got a job of a conductor.

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.458
But Badruddin who was a very jovial,
would always make..

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.208
..the passengers of the bus laugh.

00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:41.333
On one hand he used to give..

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.083
..people tickets and seats..

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.958
..on the other hand he used
to tickle their funny bone too.

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:50.417
Once, legendary actor Balraj
Sahani was travelling in his bus.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:54.417
And whilst working on
a script he saw Badruddin.

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:57.583
Seeing Badruddin's different style..

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.000
..Balraj Sahani told him to go and..

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.583
..meet Guru Dutt.
He needs such an actor.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.458
"Oh my, it is hard to survive here."

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:12.000
"Watch it.
Careful. This is Mumbai, my dear."

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:14.667
When Badruddin reached
Guru Dutt's office..

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:18.917
..he was told to
enact as a drunkard.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.167
He enacted the
character so well that..

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.083
..Guru Dutt named him after..

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.458
..his favorite scotch whisky,
Johnnie Walker.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.625
Forget a bullet I was going
to blast her with a cannon.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.708
And I even tried it twice.
But thank the womankind!

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:38.208
That look and that smile.
Madam, please give a sample.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:40.208
This...just these two things..

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.125
My life has been spent taking..

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.250
..shoe beating for those two things.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.708
And I came across such
a fool who used to beat..

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.542
..ten times and count it as one!

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.708
If he had been educated, he
would have at least counted right.

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.042
No, I mean it's a fact.
Calculations should be correct!

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:58.083
Johny Walker worked in many films.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.083
But 'Baazi', 'Aar Paar'..

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:02.708
..'Taxi Driver', 'Mr. and Mrs. 55'.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.042
'CID', 'Pyaasa' and 'Naya Daur'.

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.833
No one can forget these.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.667
This was the era
when songs were sung..

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.792
..and composed only
for the hero and heroines.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:16.250
But when Johny Walker stepped
on to the silver screen..

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.500
..very well famed
music directors like..

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.000
..O. P. Nayyar composed songs..

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.917
..taking into consideration
Johny Walker's personality.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.667
And Mohammad Rafi sang these songs.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.167
"My friend is the groom."

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.792
"And flowers are in bloom."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.875
"Everyone pray together that.."

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:36.375
"..I also get married."

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:40.417
Johny Walker considered Guru
Dutt his teacher and a mentor.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:42.792
Once in Calcutta, while shooting..

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.375
..Johny Walker and Guru
Dutt saw an oil massager.

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:49.458
That was the time when
Guru Dutt said to Johny Walker..

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.583
..'Watch that oil massager properly.

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:55.958
I want that you
play that character.'

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.083
"My oil is magical."

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:00.750
"It gets rid of
dryness and itching."

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:05.750
"The one whose head
I massage gets lucky."

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:09.958
"Listen. Listen.
Listen, dear. This massage.."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.167
"..is magic. It is one solution to
all sorrows. Why don't you try it?"

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:20.625
"Why do you worry?
Why do you worry?"

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:24.333
Johny Walker could be
seen in every Guru Dutt film.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.208
But Guru Dutt's untimely death..

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:29.708
..was a great shock to Johny Walker.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:32.458
Legendary Yusuf sir,
that is Dilip Kumar..

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:34.542
..lended a lot of support to him.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.458
Johny Walker's best
friend Shammi Kapoor..

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.333
..also went to his house.

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:43.250
He asked him, 'I want to
marry Geeta. Tell me what do I do?'

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:46.542
'Have you heard Doctor sir..

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:49.958
..saying about having
food twice, mummy?'

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.083
'Don't call me Mummy!
I have no son!'

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.125
'Oh dear!
If you had , how old would he be?'

00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:58.000
'He would have been older than you.'

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.000
'And when is he was small..

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.583
..you would have cuddled him, sung..

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:04.500
..him lullabies.

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:09.417
And after growing up, 
he would be exactly like Pritam today!'

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:11.500
'And would you have starved him?!'

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:12.458
'Not at all!'

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:13.917
'Would you have let
him die this way?!'

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.250
'Why do you say such things!?'

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.000
'Then go and get food fast!'

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.500
'I'll get it.' -'He is starving,
poor fellow!'

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.417
'I'll get it. Help me.'

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.583
'Pritam... Help her..'

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:26.917
Johny Walker was
married Noor Jahan..

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.708
..who was the sister
of the well known..

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:30.833
..actress of the time Shakila.

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:36.125
It is true that Johny Walker
is remembered for his comedy.

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.833
But if we look back,
he played such an..

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.208
..emotional character in the film..

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:42.917
..'Anand' that every
one once again had..

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.583
..to agree that
he was a great actor.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.708
Here, I'll meet you here itself,
Jaichand.

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:48.583
I won't let the curtains
go down so soon.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.625
I won't let the curtains
go down so soon.

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:54.375
And after a big interval,
Johny Walker played..

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:55.458
..a role of a drunk make-up..

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.042
..artist in Kamal Hassan's film,
'Chachi 420.'

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:06.000
It is said that after his very
good friend Gulzar cajoled him..

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.875
..he agreed to do the film,
'Chachi 420'.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:15.000
"Listen, Ms. Chatterjee.
Here is the matter of my heart."

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:20.542
In 2003, this king of comedy,
Johny Walker, left this world.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.667
But this actor completed the
journey from Black and White films..

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:27.792
..to coloured ones. Whether
it was Dilip Kumar or Dev Anand,..

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.042
..Rajesh Khanna or Amitabh Bacchan..

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.458
..Johny Walker made a special
place for himself among them.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:38.458
And for ages,
whenever we watch Johny Walker..

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:42.542
..films, we will
automatically start smiling.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.042
"I wonder where my heart's gone.

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:49.792
"It was right here. Where is it?"
