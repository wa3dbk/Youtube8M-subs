00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.700
 of trailer in radio dotcom today 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.830
 we analyzed the black diamond koichi without 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.590
 jacket a jacket designed with 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.689
 polartec with the tech power drive portal 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.970
 fishing yes that is this good I teach you 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.100
 first we see how it is built 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.270
 on the inside fix these small cells 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 that you see here I'm going to open 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 completely 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.450
 these little cells that look like these 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.180
 these larger grains of these 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.650
 rectangles what they do is stick to the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
 body give more heat but at the same time 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.910
 generate an air chamber that what's going 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.380
 to do is to catch our sweat when 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 we started to sweat and take it out 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.120
 to make us feel the driest 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.020
 possible and gaining calorific power from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.990
 agreement is a thermal garment we close 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.810
 I close zipper easy according car 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.790
 with a small cord to maneuver what 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.050
 easy the car is not open any 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.640
 The car of these is still and I suppose that 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.500
 running to the tree we will see what 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.860
 then go on the review as you see 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.230
 notched to conserve the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 calorific power inside so that we are 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.140
 be dyed and sleeves as you see wide 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.110
 elastic and in what is the fist a 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.870
 Elastic mesh designed to hold 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.000
 much more on the wrist because good 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.710
 black we have a house that has made 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
 is perhaps best known for doing things 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.880
 of climbing by doing high things 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.340
 mountain then this is thought 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.810
 also for when we are climbing 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.729
 we stretch a hand for when we have 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.410
 to get into the backpacks in the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.090
 pockets look for things that we do not know 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.700
 climb up this will help us 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.160
 hold here while keeping the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.890
 sweat and that we the calorific power 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240
 inside and prevent us from moving 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.490
 zipper agreement what I was telling you 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.869
 also pocket is not protected if 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.220
 we carry some electronic thing we are going to 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.600
 have to protect it a grid 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.510
 favoring the expulsion of sweat 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.009
 Large pocket with a lot of capacity 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.570
 agreement can also be used as 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.950
 first layer we can come out 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.300
 we can go running alone with this what 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.159
 it happens that with the zipper we 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.740
 it's kind of weird but we can use it 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.600
 also as first layer then black 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.120
 diamond here in the sleeve as you see 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.190
 also very present and high neck 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.170
 look inside with a small plush 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.600
 to make us feel comfortable we close 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.120
 Notice that reaches just below 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.020
 the chin to keep winning in 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.610
 thermal capacity as you see a first 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.380
 second layer here we use it more than 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.380
 second possibly in other countries or 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.840
 in colder areas it is used first 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.000
 layer a perfect you with the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.650
 steering wheel with difficult power drive 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.540
 Pressed shift to pull the sweat towards 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.730
 out to make us feel 10 dry of 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.190
 the house a black diamond that starts at 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.040
 running inside the train the running with 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.900
 these clothes for the runners of 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.400
 agreement so far the analysis of 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.080
 the soft call coefficients since the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.739
 portal is real in dotcom radio 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.739
 we see in the next
