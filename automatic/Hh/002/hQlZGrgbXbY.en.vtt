00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
Siri equipment that I saw in the 80s so

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.600 
Siri equipment that I saw in the 80s so
it<00:06:16.200> shows<00:06:16.410> my<00:06:16.590> age<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:16.889> hey<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.220> thought<00:06:17.490> that

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
it shows my age but hey I thought that

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.840 
it shows my age but hey I thought that
 was<00:06:17.820> cool<00:06:18.120> to<00:06:18.990> fans<00:06:19.290> nice<00:06:20.160> shroud<00:06:20.550> on<00:06:20.760> the

 was cool to fans nice shroud on the

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.810 
 was cool to fans nice shroud on the
entire<00:06:21.120> thing<00:06:21.620> now<00:06:22.620> one<00:06:23.130> of<00:06:23.160> the<00:06:23.310> really<00:06:23.580> great

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
entire thing now one of the really great

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.820 
entire thing now one of the really great
and<00:06:24.120> main<00:06:24.270> features<00:06:24.750> about<00:06:24.990> this<00:06:25.200> card<00:06:25.560> though

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
and main features about this card though

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.240 
and main features about this card though
is<00:06:26.070> the<00:06:26.940> thermal<00:06:27.389> technology<00:06:28.139> involved<00:06:28.770> this

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
is the thermal technology involved this

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.340 
is the thermal technology involved this
card<00:06:29.520> actually<00:06:29.790> has<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.270> flexible<00:06:30.780> membrane

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
card actually has a flexible membrane

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.290 
card actually has a flexible membrane
that's<00:06:31.560> inside<00:06:31.979> of<00:06:32.160> here<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.820> moves<00:06:33.120> around

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
that's inside of here that moves around

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.750 
that's inside of here that moves around
as<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.870> card<00:06:34.139> gets<00:06:34.380> hot<00:06:34.680> all<00:06:35.040> of<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.520> heat

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
as the card gets hot all of the heat

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.000 
as the card gets hot all of the heat
gets<00:06:36.150> dissipated<00:06:36.630> into<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.290> heat<00:06:37.500> fins<00:06:37.770> into

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
gets dissipated into the heat fins into

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.890 
gets dissipated into the heat fins into
the<00:06:38.160> heat<00:06:38.400> pipes<00:06:38.700> and<00:06:38.970> then<00:06:39.270> blown<00:06:39.540> out<00:06:39.720> by

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
the heat pipes and then blown out by

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.530 
the heat pipes and then blown out by
these<00:06:40.050> two<00:06:40.320> fans<00:06:40.650> so<00:06:41.220> the<00:06:41.370> card<00:06:41.610> stays<00:06:41.880> really

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
these two fans so the card stays really

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.409 
these two fans so the card stays really
really<00:06:43.020> cool<00:06:43.260> the<00:06:43.919> PCI<00:06:44.340> right<00:06:44.639> here<00:06:44.910> this<00:06:45.240> is

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
really cool the PCI right here this is

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:46.820 
really cool the PCI right here this is
PCI<00:06:45.810> 3.0

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
PCI 3.0

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.590 
PCI 3.0
I've<00:06:47.160> your<00:06:47.400> bridges<00:06:47.789> right<00:06:48.060> around<00:06:48.390> the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
I've your bridges right around the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.450 
I've your bridges right around the
corner<00:06:48.990> so<00:06:49.169> it<00:06:49.680> probably<00:06:49.979> will<00:06:50.070> be<00:06:50.100> happy<00:06:50.340> to

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
corner so it probably will be happy to

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.830 
corner so it probably will be happy to
go<00:06:50.520> back<00:06:50.789> to<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.030> table<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.419> retest

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
go back to the table and retest

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.020 
go back to the table and retest
everything<00:06:52.169> again<00:06:52.410> there<00:06:52.650> but<00:06:52.950> for<00:06:53.100> now<00:06:53.250> we're

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
everything again there but for now we're

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.730 
everything again there but for now we're
still<00:06:54.240> gonna<00:06:54.419> use<00:06:54.510> it<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.020> hopefully<00:06:55.229> results

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
still gonna use it and hopefully results

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.560 
still gonna use it and hopefully results
will<00:06:55.830> still<00:06:56.039> be<00:06:56.160> great<00:06:56.400> so<00:06:57.090> now<00:06:57.180> let's<00:06:57.360> take<00:06:57.510> a

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
will still be great so now let's take a

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.950 
will still be great so now let's take a
look<00:06:57.750> at<00:06:57.870> how<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.050> card<00:06:58.500> looks<00:06:58.710> from<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:58.950> side

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
look at how the card looks from the side

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.880 
look at how the card looks from the side
I'm<00:07:00.960> gonna<00:07:01.050> flip<00:07:01.289> it<00:07:01.410> around<00:07:01.470> I'll<00:07:01.710> show<00:07:01.740> you

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
I'm gonna flip it around I'll show you

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.920 
I'm gonna flip it around I'll show you
the<00:07:02.010> back<00:07:02.130> of<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.340> card<00:07:05.600> take<00:07:06.600> a<00:07:06.630> look<00:07:06.810> at<00:07:06.870> the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
the back of the card take a look at the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.380 
the back of the card take a look at the
side<00:07:07.140> right<00:07:07.320> here<00:07:07.550> you<00:07:08.550> guys<00:07:08.700> can<00:07:08.970> see<00:07:09.150> this<00:07:09.270> is

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.390 
side right here you guys can see this is

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.700 
side right here you guys can see this is
the<00:07:09.479> XFX<00:07:10.140> are<00:07:11.240> 7850<00:07:12.240> with<00:07:12.810> ghost<00:07:13.169> thermal

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
the XFX are 7850 with ghost thermal

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.520 
the XFX are 7850 with ghost thermal
technology<00:07:14.280> we<00:07:14.850> have<00:07:15.030> two<00:07:15.389> 6-pin<00:07:16.289> power

single<00:07:20.550> I'll<00:07:20.700> flip<00:07:20.880> this<00:07:20.970> around<00:07:21.030> we<00:07:21.810> also

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
single I'll flip this around we also

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.170 
single I'll flip this around we also
have<00:07:22.139> a<00:07:22.200> single<00:07:22.770> crossfire<00:07:23.520> connection<00:07:24.060> right

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
have a single crossfire connection right

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.110 
have a single crossfire connection right
here<00:07:24.470> as<00:07:25.470> we<00:07:26.100> take<00:07:26.220> a<00:07:26.280> look<00:07:26.370> through<00:07:26.520> our<00:07:26.639> EO<00:07:26.820> we

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 
here as we take a look through our EO we

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.240 
here as we take a look through our EO we
can<00:07:27.240> see<00:07:27.360> that<00:07:27.479> XFX<00:07:27.900> clearly<00:07:28.410> has<00:07:28.800> their<00:07:29.010> label

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
can see that XFX clearly has their label
