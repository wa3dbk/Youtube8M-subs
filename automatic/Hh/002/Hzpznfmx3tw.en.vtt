I've<00:00:09.760> been<00:00:09.910> working<00:00:10.210> with<00:00:10.240> Tarlov<00:00:10.870> cysts

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
I've been working with Tarlov cysts

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.240 
I've been working with Tarlov cysts
since<00:00:12.130> I<00:00:12.219> was<00:00:12.370> in<00:00:12.519> residency<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:14.259> my<00:00:14.710> residency

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
since I was in residency in my residency

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.330 
since I was in residency in my residency
training<00:00:15.280> we<00:00:16.619> treated<00:00:17.619> patients<00:00:18.070> who<00:00:18.160> had

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
training we treated patients who had

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.639 
training we treated patients who had
similar<00:00:18.669> types<00:00:19.029> of<00:00:19.210> cysts<00:00:19.660> but<00:00:20.200> it<00:00:20.410> was<00:00:20.500> always

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:20.649 
similar types of cysts but it was always

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.299 
similar types of cysts but it was always
felt<00:00:20.980> that<00:00:21.960> tarlof<00:00:22.960> cysts<00:00:23.259> themselves<00:00:24.009> were

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:24.309 
felt that tarlof cysts themselves were

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:26.760 
felt that tarlof cysts themselves were
not<00:00:25.000> treatable<00:00:25.390> I've<00:00:25.869> performed<00:00:26.290> surgery<00:00:26.739> on
