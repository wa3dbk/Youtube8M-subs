00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 welcome people to another 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 pokémon analysis this will be the last 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.410
 be the analysis that I'm going to do for you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.969
 the two pokémon games accent at 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 dundee will appear next Saturday and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.350
 yes i think by now it is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 Just set the news and we have to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 Just play the game 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 and yes, I would not have any 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 fold out further information in case something does 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 you will have to give it a new one 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 whole look somewhere else because of me 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.730
 will not get out any more so yes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 players seem to be next 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 Saturday should be a week and now 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.460
 be two days if I am not mistaken 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 and yes I think so far we hold it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 out without further information then how 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.420
 we want to say that in the meantime 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.190
 locked with spoilers with 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 Information with more and one as 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.469
 just not necessary anymore 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.910
 experience 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.170
 but still there is in this video 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 one more information 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 maybe one or the other 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.539
 could move one of the two 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 to buy games because this is here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 really a reason they play the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.449
 other indications to decide 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.549
 or to be able to do or what is what 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.380
 it was the information yes it became 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 a new klo rat presented yes there is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 already that some complain so mega 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 that we have already seen and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 meanwhile there is a new one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.799
 a black clark that means mega grc 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 ex and the other is called mega gloor 2 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.479
 or y iks blabla which i find 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.220
 finds horny it is black and so stands 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.990
 that works very well because it's just smart 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 with the black color village blue 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.579
 color looks just great and I think 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 that really cool 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.790
 So I like it very well as well 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.290
 is still the type dragon him 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.850
 I approached think it's flying dragon 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 or dragon I think earlier 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 flying dragon I was not as good 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.950
 I have to inform you, I think 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.540
 In any case, the flying roof is now 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.240
 a kite pokémon that's what 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.159
 counts and I think it is definitely 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.350
 cool and for me that is a reason for me 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.630
 to take pokémon ex and not everywhere 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 so already two reasons namely the milieu 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 the horny looks like dizziness and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.960
 then now the mega plain text so 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.670
 we have two good arguments for me 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 to buy the game because I finds 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.280
 Total geiler monastery possibly 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 otherwise you may find that others 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.250
 better can order you can 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 So you can tell me that you 're funny 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 Write if you would find gala 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.210
 I may be interested in me 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 I'm the black looks just great 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.880
 or blue no idea and write 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.980
 I'll come if you find hornier 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.690
 yes, that could possibly decide 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.070
 what we take in his team then disturbs 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.960
 This clark is cool us maybe 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.600
 could be one or the other 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.310
 Decide to stop big 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.840
 contract during the adventure I think 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.290
 I could have done that, who knows 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.180
 look 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.100
 you'll see that in let's play 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.750
 that also appears during the day when the game 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.490
 So if it's still there, it still appears 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 not fixed i do a let's play of 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.970
 the game makes sense really makes sense 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 otherwise I would like this analysis 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.459
 do not do that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.900
 Well, there is still an info table still 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.370
 he did not steal out 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.220
 Only the toilet was presented 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 So that's the new colored clark or 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 so there was other information 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.900
 before this one was so certain 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.310
 pokemon and I did not have any 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.130
 Analysis made that day easy 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.959
 that I am being moved now very much 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.640
 had a lot of stress and just held 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.500
 no time and no desire 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.570
 I record something during this time 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.440
 I thought it would be nice to come here 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.880
 Just let's be this time 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.860
 so do not care 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.540
 well in any case, there was still trailer 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.570
 to this new blu-ray I have 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.250
 just not ready because I still 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.720
 no internet and just like that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.310
 quite a race team record the pictures 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.380
 I downloaded myself from a friend 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.030
 so that I can insert you with it 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.769
 to see what else you have to see 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.360
 the people's house and of course because it is 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.400
 also the final video will be the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.230
 Of course, final analysis should also be 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.410
 a little fancier do not look quite 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.010
 cheap so with no picture or the work 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.370
 totally dumb 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.070
 Well that's what I say for that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.110
 also wanted information and too 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.950
 pokémon excel knows what else to say 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.140
 wanted is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.980
 I wanted to thank everyone 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.320
 to my analyzes always regularly 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.670
 have followed then yes I have you 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.310
 I really liked it 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.709
 have fun where that can and indeed 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.030
 just so so different from place 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.090
 Recording is different than us 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.580
 most of the time you have to look at these videos like that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.220
 already write a script what to say 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.019
 must why and what and what happens 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.539
 not from 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.669
 yes you have to record several times 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.710
 so it just sounds great or sounds 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.110
 us yes I therefore very much 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.460
 to deal with that in any case 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.080
 not as fast as it looks 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.620
 Video may take five to six 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.509
 minutes but that's the procedure for that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.479
 It usually takes about one to make 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.190
 I'm sure for sure and I wanted to 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.229
 Thank you all for having me so good 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.210
 the videos have rated positive 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.150
 who wrote to me comments us 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.370
 Thank you so much, thank you 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.430
 you look at these videos then yes 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.990
 Like I said , it's just fun and me 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.400
 that just makes me happy when i am 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.870
 see that people have fun in that 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.759
 That's just what they like 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.340
 to watch and hear my voice 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.530
 would like to give us this information 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.139
 want to receive in this sense yes 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.919
 So yes people as I said this is 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.389
 now the last analysis video and he 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.159
 will not come that let's play 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.960
 starts now in the week or so 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.840
 approximately 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.389
 and until then we'll hear each other 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.539
 us in one of the parks or something 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.300
 I guess look and yes I thank you 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:35.130
 me again one last time with you 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.750
 Just four your support and so and 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.029
 I would say people see you 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.029
 again I say chips
