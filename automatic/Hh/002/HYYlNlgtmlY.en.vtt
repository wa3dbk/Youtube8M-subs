00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
next piece was something I was kind of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.309 
next piece was something I was kind of
on<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.459> fence<00:03:33.609> about<00:03:33.879> but<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:35.049> ended<00:03:35.229> up

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
on the fence about but I just ended up

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.860 
on the fence about but I just ended up
getting<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.799> because<00:03:35.919> it<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:36.879> nine<00:03:37.419> iron

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
getting it because it is a nine iron

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.349 
getting it because it is a nine iron
shirt<00:03:38.500> which<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.889> thought<00:03:39.040> was<00:03:39.159> interesting<00:03:39.359> it

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
shirt which I thought was interesting it

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.589 
shirt which I thought was interesting it
says<00:03:40.540> non<00:03:40.810> iron<00:03:41.109> right<00:03:41.409> there<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.919> the<00:03:41.979> tag<00:03:42.599> and

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
says non iron right there on the tag and

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.949 
says non iron right there on the tag and
I've<00:03:43.900> never<00:03:44.229> seen<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.790> shirt<00:03:46.720> like<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.509 
I've never seen like a shirt like that
and<00:03:47.319> maybe<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:47.799> because<00:03:47.949> I<00:03:48.159> don't<00:03:48.220> really

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and maybe it's because I don't really

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.140 
and maybe it's because I don't really
shop<00:03:48.970> for<00:03:49.329> like<00:03:50.229> button<00:03:50.979> up<00:03:51.099> shirts<00:03:51.400> or<00:03:51.729> I

really<00:05:01.940> good<00:05:02.090> quality<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.660> he<00:05:02.720> has<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:02.960> really

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
really good quality and he has a really

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.100 
really good quality and he has a really
nice<00:05:03.440> hood<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.160> i<00:05:05.060> haven't<00:05:05.389> tested<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.900> see<00:05:05.930> if

it's<00:05:06.560> waterproof<00:05:06.830> yet<00:05:07.340> but<00:05:08.060> i<00:05:08.389> think<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:09.080> is

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
it's waterproof yet but i think it is

it's waterproof yet but i think it is
and<00:05:09.830> if<00:05:10.039> it<00:05:10.220> really<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.699> then<00:05:11.210> that's<00:05:11.810> like

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
and if it really is then that's like

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.150 
and if it really is then that's like
really<00:05:12.139> exciting<00:05:12.560> because<00:05:12.590> i<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:12.979> definitely

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
whatever so I just thought that was

whatever so I just thought that was
really<00:05:58.580> cool<00:05:58.699> I've<00:05:58.970> never<00:05:59.120> really<00:05:59.449> seen<00:05:59.630> a

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
really cool I've never really seen a

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.050 
really cool I've never really seen a
satchel<00:06:00.110> like<00:06:00.259> this<00:06:00.409> before<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:01.039> I<00:06:01.789> think<00:06:02.000> I

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
satchel like this before and I think I

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.700 
satchel like this before and I think I
got<00:06:02.240> this<00:06:02.360> for<00:06:02.539> like<00:06:02.690> four<00:06:02.960> dollars<00:06:03.289> so<00:06:03.560> it's

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
got this for like four dollars so it's

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.469 
got this for like four dollars so it's
really<00:06:03.889> not<00:06:04.099> a<00:06:04.159> bad<00:06:04.370> deal<00:06:04.610> for<00:06:04.669> something<00:06:05.300> that

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
really not a bad deal for something that

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.129 
really not a bad deal for something that
is<00:06:05.750> in<00:06:06.380> my<00:06:07.099> opinion<00:06:07.250> really<00:06:07.789> really<00:06:08.090> cute<00:06:08.360> so
