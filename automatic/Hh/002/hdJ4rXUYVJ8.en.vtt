00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.040
 greet and this time not alone 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.320
 No, I have a guest today 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.750
 with me he is like biscuit is not 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.790
 the crumbly monster there that's me 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.560
 it was like I should say he says 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.539
 My name is all good , I was called 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.230
 even for a few months a 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.090
 channel on youtube and I think so 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 that one does not know or am going now 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.510
 Just from I knew you 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 a little longer you know well 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.989
 you were one of my first 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.210
 false ceilings credible solve 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.890
 that may be i know that i am right 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.489
 good that there have brought so and sees 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.079
 one again 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.210
 I think you should not just German 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.610
 Subscribe I do not know a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.469
 million subscribers already have 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.120
 simply the things that drives up 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.430
 out yet or had looks just as quickly 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.690
 That's why you got it from that 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.850
 I was right but that's why 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 you actually here until I had times 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
 the subscribers here asked of me 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.920
 which topics you discussed again 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.690
 wanted and then all to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.899
 voting released 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 on facebook and people wanted that 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.600
 I actually wanted to see you too 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.630
 ask if they talk about themselves 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.729
 commentators on youtube also in the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.280
 So reallife should show if theirs 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.409
 to bring live videos or not 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 and in the question a little bit 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.549
 pass on before I have something to say 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.810
 So yes, I'm actually the one 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.619
 Of course you could theoretically 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.990
 do 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.030
 So I did that too 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.799
 but just lay it that I am not 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.900
 laptop had no ps3 no 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.460
 Game console for three whole weeks long 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.600
 and then I had to open something 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.610
 bring youtube there I have me live 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.409
 made videos and that came very well 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 I was really surprised at that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.960
 rating as normal cd gameplays and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.759
 so on and I mean sausage that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.040
 negative about it when looking at the im 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.689
 internet shows so there were of course 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.189
 already negative cases where you have the 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.930
 half sentences was insulted 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.860
 but you should not too 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.560
 take it seriously and so i have to say at 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.000
 me that too spontaneous with you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.799
 thing with me which is also spontaneous 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.120
 thing at that time with where I said we 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.280
 Sometime 200 thumbs up 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.980
 get a video then I do 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.470
 so in real life video 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 this is of course more than imagined 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.799
 that I always think one should 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.269
 so to speak, so I had to 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.959
 then do that and free everything 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.810
 no problem 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.299
 I think so easy I do not see any 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.769
 problem with showing yourself 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.930
 what you look like most have 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.310
 facebook or twitter or something there 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.230
 are other pictures in it 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.360
 So why not have a look at the camera? 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.049
 for the iphone or whatever and when 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
 that absorbs 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.040
 Come and show yourself then 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.900
 Yes exactly 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.920
 So I do not see a thing and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.280
 but what you mentioned that I think so 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.250
 also very important that the people the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.099
 Show yourself then there is already heard 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 a certain courage to meyer 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.280
 So, not everybody's thing 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.959
 not to talk to so many people and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.420
 then maybe to show that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.180
 to give these people now in the case you 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.549
 and me that respect there yes 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.129
 against and does not say that you 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.680
 the fin crooked nose or your ears 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.390
 are stupid or i do not know what it is 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:29.310
 for me a no go yes that's no 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.290
 Respect and actually and also for 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.819
 people then just like me 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.609
 Comments under it should radiate themselves 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.750
 Just be yourself and see 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.079
 like this one on the 18th 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.669
 Now it does not matter because 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.810
 Honestly, if I am 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.340
 There is a commentary there 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.840
 degenerate terrys also where then that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.060
 own picture with inserted I think 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.769
 everything is great but basically 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.590
 It's actually here at it 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.410
 youtube what the person is saying that 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.739
 is if there I do not know who also 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.319
 always there is quasi modo or 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.959
 germany's next topmodel has none at all 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.620
 very much to do 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.269
 yes that's very important but that's it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.109
 Most people pay attention to their looks 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:17.820
 even if it is too masculine 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.989
 there we have to be afraid now one 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.209
 Little thing to say because time 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.889
 really urges gameplay is by the way 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.229
 of their playing if you're wondering 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:30.479
 why is there so well played is that 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:33.240
 I would not say that's where you go if 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.560
 you show yourself so you always go that 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.190
 the risk of being on the street too 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.830
 is recognized 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.390
 but I think that's not all 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.330
 problem-if you really live in 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.880
 stands and knows who you are then also has 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.159
 nothing to do with age then you are 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.110
 just the one you are and if you have one 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.909
 Man on the street looks at under grad 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.580
 briefly talked about it I have 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.719
 already recognized which I think then can 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.650
 I am also addressed or 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.849
 probably you can then 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.789
 pronounce and then you can completely 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.000
 talk about it normally when you have time 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:05.310
 Everything was fine , so I have to 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.870
 Just take a look here 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.310
 youtube first thumbs up 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.080
 I have to ask the story so the question 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.550
 give up a belief yes 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.719
 all cases could be all 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.630
 commentators if they want it 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.080
 like live video here on youtube 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.830
 demonstrate 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.900
 that's exactly where you are here 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.400
 you really started the opponent 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.960
 Can I have time left is that 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.849
 gameplay is already around 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.430
 small clip family behind simple 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.979
 something like that happened to me while gambling 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.840
 I do not have to say that again 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.360
 you can only play on kde as well 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.030
 so just play for fun with so 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.150
 there is something you see now too 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.789
 and otherwise come to the end last 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.320
 Word, of course, but a guest before me 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.280
 Of course my husband and I said that 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.770
 Hope you see you again 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.360
 yes okay thank you first for the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.430
 invitation that I here with you the 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.969
 could make commentary and yes too 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.969
 three people
