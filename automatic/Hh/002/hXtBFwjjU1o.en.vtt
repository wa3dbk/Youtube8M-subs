00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
so let's keep playing here let's see if

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
so let's keep playing here let's see if
we<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.170> higher<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.430> my

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
we can get higher than that one of my

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.770 
we can get higher than that one of my
favorite<00:00:56.789> things<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.270> game<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
favorite things about this game is that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
favorite things about this game is that
even<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> die<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.489> don't<00:00:59.879> feel<00:01:00.120> angry

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
even when I die I don't feel angry

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.290 
even when I die I don't feel angry
because<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.590> animation<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.969> squirrel

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
because the animation that this squirrel

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
because the animation that this squirrel
makes<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> dies<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.159> hot<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.330> pretty

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
makes when it dies it's hot it's pretty

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300 
makes when it dies it's hot it's pretty
it's<00:01:06.960> pretty<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> bad

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it's pretty good it's not a bad

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
it's pretty good it's not a bad
animation<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> more

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
animation at all and I think that more

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
animation at all and I think that more
games<00:01:10.860> should<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.580> animations<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
games should have animations like this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.800 
games should have animations like this
this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.979> well<00:01:14.040> come<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.760> let's<00:01:15.330> get

would<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.210> pretty<00:01:24.420> nice<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.930> feel<00:01:25.110> like

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
would be to be pretty nice I feel like

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
would be to be pretty nice I feel like
that<00:01:25.380> would<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.860> good<00:01:26.490> accomplishment<00:01:27.000> once

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that would be a good accomplishment once

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.969 
that would be a good accomplishment once
you<00:01:27.750> start<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.640> kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.140> yes<00:01:31.140> yes

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you start going you can kind of yes yes

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
you start going you can kind of yes yes
once<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.329> into<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> mood<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
once you kind of get into the mood and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
once you kind of get into the mood and
you<00:01:34.590> start<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.100> fast<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.060> gets<00:01:36.210> easier<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you start going fast it gets easier I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.390 
you start going fast it gets easier I
think<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.650> soon<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> lose

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
think then as soon as you kind of lose

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
think then as soon as you kind of lose
your<00:01:38.579> flow<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.360> dead<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
your flow you're dead which is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
your flow you're dead which is
unfortunate<00:01:40.579> come<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.700> let's<00:01:41.880> try<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> get

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
unfortunate come on let's try to get

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.020 
unfortunate come on let's try to get
something<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.740> yes<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.490> notice<00:01:44.790> every<00:01:45.000> time

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
something here yes and notice every time

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700 
something here yes and notice every time
I<00:01:45.180> start<00:01:45.479> getting<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.840> few<00:01:46.020> usually<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.560> go

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I start getting a few usually I go

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
I start getting a few usually I go
pretty<00:01:46.890> high<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.729> sometimes<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.360> mess<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.540> on

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pretty high but sometimes I mess up on

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.230 
pretty high but sometimes I mess up on
the<00:01:48.869> first<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.579> first<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the first one to the first one is a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639 
the first one to the first one is a
little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.689> easier<00:01:51.840> though<00:01:52.200> usually<00:01:52.350> because

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
little bit easier though usually because

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.810 
little bit easier though usually because
you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> run<00:01:53.280> around<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.790> see

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you can kind of run around you can see

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.539 
you can kind of run around you can see
my<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:54.930> scroll<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> run<00:01:55.829> from<00:01:56.250> left<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
my my scroll here can run from left to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.039 
my my scroll here can run from left to
right<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> time

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
right and I can I can just kind of time

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.560 
right and I can I can just kind of time
it<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.009> jump<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.640> can't<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.360> do

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it out but if I jump I can't really do

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.480 
it out but if I jump I can't really do
that<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.890> straightaway

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that I have to I have to straightaway

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
that I have to I have to straightaway
jump<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> next<00:02:03.299> branch<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:03.810> otherwise<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
jump the next branch because otherwise I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
jump the next branch because otherwise I
fall<00:02:04.409> through<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> hole<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> let's<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.270> how<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
fall through the hole so let's see how I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.880 
fall through the hole so let's see how I
wouldn't<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.079> let's<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.770> can

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
wouldn't get here let's see if we can

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
wouldn't get here let's see if we can
get<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.250> new<00:02:08.879> high<00:02:09.090> score<00:02:09.479> come<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.590> ah<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.760> is
