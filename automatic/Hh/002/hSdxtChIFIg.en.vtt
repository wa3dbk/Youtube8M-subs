00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
look at this you can see the branches

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.530 
look at this you can see the branches
that<00:02:53.180> are<00:02:53.450> crossing<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.609> is<00:02:55.879> what<00:02:56.209> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
that are crossing and this is what is

just for you to see a bit more so start

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.900 
just for you to see a bit more so start
at<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.630> control<00:03:36.109> just<00:03:36.590> like<00:03:36.799> normally<00:03:37.760> who

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
at the control just like normally who

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.720 
at the control just like normally who
study<00:03:38.180> control<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:40.190> we<00:03:40.310> start<00:03:40.579> adding

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
study control and then we start adding

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:57.800 
study control and then we start adding
the<00:03:41.030> branches<00:03:46.480> more<00:03:47.480> branches<00:03:48.049> are<00:03:48.260> going<00:03:48.440> in

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
