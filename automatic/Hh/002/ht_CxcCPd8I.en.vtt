00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.290 

so<00:00:13.650> here's<00:00:13.830> another<00:00:14.100> huge<00:00:14.790> mess

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
so here's another huge mess

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.230 
so here's another huge mess
that<00:00:15.600> eating<00:00:15.960> disorders<00:00:16.440> are<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.680> choice<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.370> I

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
that eating disorders are a choice and I

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.030 
that eating disorders are a choice and I
think<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> perhaps<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.770> most

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
think this is perhaps the the most

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.609 
think this is perhaps the the most
damaging<00:00:20.700> one<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:21.480> patients<00:00:22.200> have<00:00:22.230> had

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
damaging one that our patients have had

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
damaging one that our patients have had
to<00:00:22.860> deal<00:00:23.040> with<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.520> still<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.390> when

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to deal with and we still see this when

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
to deal with and we still see this when
patients<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.830> emergency<00:00:26.340> room<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
patients go to the emergency room and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.850 
patients go to the emergency room and
they<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.270> triaged<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:28.230> far<00:00:28.470> down<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
they get triaged really far down the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.409 
they get triaged really far down the
priority<00:00:29.070> list<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> physician

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
priority list because the physician

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.690 
priority list because the physician
thinks<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.110> somehow<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.919> chose<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.310> have<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
thinks that somehow they chose to have a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.270 
thinks that somehow they chose to have a
ruptured<00:00:33.090> esophagus<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:34.200> chose<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:35.070> have

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ruptured esophagus or they chose to have

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.640 
ruptured esophagus or they chose to have
electrolyte<00:00:36.150> imbalance<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.530> gonna

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
electrolyte imbalance but we're gonna

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.000 
electrolyte imbalance but we're gonna
bust<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.260> one<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.500> reasons<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
bust it now and one of the reasons that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.520 
bust it now and one of the reasons that
I<00:00:41.130> think<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.700> myth<00:00:42.030> has<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.780> stuck<00:00:43.290> with

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I think this myth has really stuck with

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
I think this myth has really stuck with
anorexia<00:00:44.250> nervosa<00:00:44.370> perhaps<00:00:45.240> more<00:00:45.690> than<00:00:45.960> other

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
anorexia nervosa perhaps more than other

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
anorexia nervosa perhaps more than other
psychiatric<00:00:46.560> disorders<00:00:47.310> is<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> call<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
psychiatric disorders is what I call the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
psychiatric disorders is what I call the
tyranny<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.900> face<00:00:49.170> validity<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.000> people<00:00:51.000> see

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
tyranny of face validity and people see

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.630 
tyranny of face validity and people see
this<00:00:51.630> all<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:51.960> time<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.710> People<00:00:53.130> magazine

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this all the time in People magazine

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.810 
this all the time in People magazine
they<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.480> Calvin<00:00:54.900> Klein<00:00:54.930> ads<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.680> see

they see the Calvin Klein ads they see
Twiggy<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> 60s<00:00:57.810> or<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.080> see<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
Twiggy back in the 60s or they see the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.470 
Twiggy back in the 60s or they see the
models<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.760> make<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.150> association

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
models and they make an association

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.160 
models and they make an association
between<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.890> cultural<00:01:02.640> thin<00:01:03.000> ideal<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:03.780> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
between the cultural thin ideal and what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.999 
between the cultural thin ideal and what
they<00:01:04.320> imagined<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.159> anorexia<00:01:06.150> nervosa

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
they imagined to be anorexia nervosa

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.950 
they imagined to be anorexia nervosa
what<00:01:08.009> they<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.119> difference

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
what they don't see is the difference

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
what they don't see is the difference
between<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.680> two<00:01:10.920> pictures<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> would

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
between these two pictures this would

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
between these two pictures this would
never<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.070> front<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> People<00:01:15.119> magazine

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
never be on the front of People magazine

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750 
never be on the front of People magazine
because<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.860> nothing<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.550> with<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
because that has nothing to do with a

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.790 
because that has nothing to do with a
cultural<00:01:18.240> sin<00:01:18.480> I<00:01:18.600> deal<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> ask<00:01:19.470> our

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
cultural sin I deal and if you ask our

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.310 
cultural sin I deal and if you ask our
patients<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.790> something<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.930> People

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
patients if something like People

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
patients if something like People
magazine<00:01:22.800> or<00:01:22.980> models<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.730> what<00:01:23.940> put<00:01:24.240> them<00:01:24.420> on

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
magazine or models was what put them on

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
magazine or models was what put them on
the<00:01:24.780> path<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> develop<00:01:25.680> anorexia<00:01:26.250> nervosa<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the path to develop anorexia nervosa the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.290 
the path to develop anorexia nervosa the
vast<00:01:27.390> majority<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.170> say<00:01:28.500> no<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.790> there

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
vast majority of them say no and there

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.420 
vast majority of them say no and there
might<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.690> been<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.380> role<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.130> very

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
might have been a role in the very

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
might have been a role in the very
beginning<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.120> made<00:01:33.330> them<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:34.080> gonna

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
beginning that made them think I'm gonna

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
beginning that made them think I'm gonna
go<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.800> first<00:01:35.100> diet<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.300> minute

anomalous biology kicks in and anorexia

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.969 
anomalous biology kicks in and anorexia
nervosa<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.900> sends<00:01:43.290> them<00:01:43.440> down<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:43.650> path
