adjust how it is so if you have like a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
adjust how it is so if you have like a
shallower<00:00:39.660> cutter<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.440> deeper<00:00:41.750> grind<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:43.020> Yat

why I ran it through it but it it stayed
the<00:02:57.570> same<00:02:57.600> because<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.380> already<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:58.680> sharp

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the same because it was already as sharp

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.920 
the same because it was already as sharp
as<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.040> could<00:02:59.250> be

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
