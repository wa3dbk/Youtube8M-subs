for<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:12.090> men<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.479> knew<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.110> could<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.470> it

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
for the two men I knew we could get it

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
for the two men I knew we could get it
with<00:01:14.729> him<00:01:14.850> coming<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> screen<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.869> knew

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
with him coming off the screen I knew

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.670 
with him coming off the screen I knew
he'd<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.560> wide<00:01:16.830> open<00:01:17.060> because<00:01:18.470> they<00:01:19.470> know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
he'd be wide open because they know

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.780 
he'd be wide open because they know
we're<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> screen<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> other<00:01:20.640> guy

we're going to screen for the other guy

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.399 
we're going to screen for the other guy
so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.119> faked<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> he<00:01:21.540> came<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:21.869> he's<00:01:22.110> open

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
