00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
so the thing that's great as you can
within<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.140> application<00:02:20.380> you're<00:02:20.890> able<00:02:21.100> to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
within this application you're able to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.500 
within this application you're able to
switch<00:02:21.400> between<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.880> front<00:02:22.060> rear<00:02:22.270> facing

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
switch between the front rear facing

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.700 
switch between the front rear facing
camera<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.080> can<00:02:23.170> actually<00:02:23.380> show<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
camera so you can actually show the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.440 
camera so you can actually show the
person<00:02:24.070> you're<00:02:24.160> speaking<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.670> what's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
person you're speaking to what's

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.940 
person you're speaking to what's

happening in the environment that I do

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.770 
happening in the environment that I do
and<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:29.200> camera<00:02:29.560> switch<00:02:29.770> out<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> we're

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and that camera switch out so we're

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
and that camera switch out so we're
shopping<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.620> can<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:32.950> kind<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> switch

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
shopping you can just kind of switch

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.250 
shopping you can just kind of switch
back<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.210> forth<00:02:34.360> between<00:02:34.660> yourself<00:02:35.110> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
back and forth between yourself and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.190 
back and forth between yourself and
exactly<00:02:37.080> any<00:02:38.080> other<00:02:38.200> questions<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.800> hunt

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
exactly any other questions on this hunt
