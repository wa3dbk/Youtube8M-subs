we<00:00:18.830> use<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.039> bread<00:00:19.340> scraper<00:00:19.699> we<00:00:19.970> sell<00:00:20.270> these<00:00:20.449> on

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
we use a bread scraper we sell these on

we use a bread scraper we sell these on
the<00:00:20.720> webpage<00:00:20.869> by<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:21.350> way<00:00:21.970> her<00:00:22.970> bread<00:00:23.300> dough

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
the webpage by the way her bread dough

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.570 
the webpage by the way her bread dough
out<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.310> bowl<00:00:26.770> and<00:00:27.770> under<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.190> surface

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
out of the bowl and under the surface

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.000 
out of the bowl and under the surface
the<00:00:28.730> surface<00:00:28.760> isn't<00:00:29.480> really<00:00:29.750> floured<00:00:30.170> then<00:00:30.920> we

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
the surface isn't really floured then we

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.130 
the surface isn't really floured then we
stretch<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:31.340> well<00:00:31.850> we<00:00:31.939> try<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.180> pull<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.780> out<00:00:32.899> so

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
stretch it well we try to pull it out so

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.529 
stretch it well we try to pull it out so
it's<00:00:33.260> about<00:00:33.469> 1/3<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:33.980> original<00:00:34.550> height<00:00:34.820> is

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
it's about 1/3 the original height is

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.420 
it's about 1/3 the original height is
when<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:35.989> started<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.649> not<00:00:39.010> wrenching<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.190> I'm

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
when we started and not wrenching it I'm

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.370 
when we started and not wrenching it I'm
not<00:00:40.550> jerking<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.210> I'm<00:00:41.300> trying<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.719> tease<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:42.290> I

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
not jerking it I'm trying to tease it I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.790 
not jerking it I'm trying to tease it I
use<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.950> dough<00:00:43.579> scraper<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:45.530> help<00:00:45.739> spread<00:00:46.040> it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
use the dough scraper to help spread it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.650 
use the dough scraper to help spread it
once<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.010> been<00:00:49.190> spread<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:52.000> feel<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.329> see

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
once it's been spread I feel it and see

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.209 
once it's been spread I feel it and see
if<00:00:53.719> there's<00:00:53.899> any<00:00:54.110> lumps<00:00:54.469> of<00:00:54.649> flour<00:00:54.860> that

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
if there's any lumps of flour that

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.520 
if there's any lumps of flour that
haven't<00:00:55.610> been<00:00:55.960> incorporated<00:00:56.960> or<00:00:57.110> whether<00:00:57.289> I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
haven't been incorporated or whether I

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.150 
haven't been incorporated or whether I
feel<00:00:57.770> lumps<00:00:58.840> which<00:00:59.840> is<00:01:00.050> not<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.649> common<00:01:00.890> this

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
feel lumps which is not that common this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.799 
feel lumps which is not that common this
size<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.399> batch<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:02.059> dough<00:01:02.180> I'll<00:01:02.360> use<00:01:02.539> with<00:01:02.750> the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
size a batch of dough I'll use with the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.139 
size a batch of dough I'll use with the
French<00:01:03.050> challah<00:01:03.260> for<00:01:03.469> size<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.039> mash<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:04.759> with

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
French challah for size and mash it with

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.539 
French challah for size and mash it with
the<00:01:05.360> heel<00:01:06.259> of<00:01:06.380> my<00:01:06.409> hand<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.890> try<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.189> get<00:01:07.399> this

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
the heel of my hand I try to get this

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.459 
the heel of my hand I try to get this
done<00:01:07.819> the<00:01:07.969> first<00:01:08.209> time<00:01:08.509> we<00:01:08.779> do<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.020> stretch<00:01:09.289> in

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
done the first time we do the stretch in

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.840 
done the first time we do the stretch in
the<00:01:09.529> fold<00:01:09.770> we'll<00:01:09.979> do<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.219> two<00:01:10.369> more<00:01:10.399> times

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
the fold we'll do it two more times

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.899 
the fold we'll do it two more times
before<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.359> make<00:01:11.539> loaves<00:01:12.789> because<00:01:13.789> the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
before you make loaves because the

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.910 
before you make loaves because the
facade<00:01:14.299> as<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.659> French<00:01:14.869> call<00:01:14.959> it<00:01:15.139> is<00:01:15.380> damaging

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
facade as the French call it is damaging

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.699 
facade as the French call it is damaging
to<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.159> dough<00:01:16.310> structure<00:01:16.819> and<00:01:17.659> I'd<00:01:18.439> rather

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
to the dough structure and I'd rather

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.199 
to the dough structure and I'd rather
get<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.159> over<00:01:19.429> with<00:01:19.609> as<00:01:19.819> soon<00:01:19.849> as<00:01:20.090> possible

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
get that over with as soon as possible

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.120 
get that over with as soon as possible
so<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:21.020> won't<00:01:21.229> be<00:01:21.289> damaging<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.950> dough

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
so we won't be damaging the dough

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.969 
so we won't be damaging the dough
further<00:01:22.459> into<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.849> process<00:01:23.499> once<00:01:24.499> next<00:01:24.799> time

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
further into the process once next time

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.309 
further into the process once next time
we<00:01:25.159> pulled<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.549> down<00:01:27.219> slow<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.249> up<00:01:29.200> fold<00:01:30.200> it

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
we pulled it down slow it up fold it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.659 
we pulled it down slow it up fold it
over<00:01:31.959> look<00:01:32.959> again<00:01:33.439> as<00:01:33.679> we<00:01:33.829> fold<00:01:34.069> it<00:01:34.189> over<00:01:34.279> for<00:01:34.639> a

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:34.669 
over look again as we fold it over for a

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:38.099 
over look again as we fold it over for a
dry<00:01:34.880> dough<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.450> mashing<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.469> up<00:01:36.590> across<00:01:37.520> Laur

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
dry dough and mashing it up across Laur

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.529 
dry dough and mashing it up across Laur
pull<00:01:39.109> it<00:01:39.259> over<00:01:39.409> that's<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:41.209> a<00:01:41.240> wider

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
pull it over that's it with a wider

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.230 
pull it over that's it with a wider
dough<00:01:41.749> I<00:01:41.779> might<00:01:42.139> do<00:01:42.319> it<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.560> second<00:01:42.950> time

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
dough I might do it a second time

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.669 
dough I might do it a second time
immediately<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.509> build<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.990> bow<00:01:45.139> every<00:01:45.439> time

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
immediately to build the bow every time

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.679 
immediately to build the bow every time
you<00:01:45.950> stretch<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.909> fold<00:01:47.029> the<00:01:47.209> dough<00:01:47.329> strength

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
you stretch and fold the dough strength

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.089 
you stretch and fold the dough strength
improves<00:01:48.109> you<00:01:48.289> can<00:01:48.380> see<00:01:48.499> this<00:01:48.619> looks<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:48.919> lot

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
improves you can see this looks a lot

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.309 
improves you can see this looks a lot
more<00:01:49.279> like<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.520> dough<00:01:49.789> than<00:01:50.569> it<00:01:50.689> did<00:01:50.840> just<00:01:51.109> a<00:01:51.289> few

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
more like a dough than it did just a few

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.529 
more like a dough than it did just a few
minutes<00:01:51.709> ago<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:51.979> certainly<00:01:52.219> more<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:53.509> a

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
minutes ago and certainly more like a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.109 
minutes ago and certainly more like a
dough<00:01:53.749> than<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:54.020> did<00:01:54.169> 45<00:01:54.679> minutes<00:01:55.009> ago<00:01:55.219> very

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
dough than it did 45 minutes ago very

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.639 
dough than it did 45 minutes ago very
little<00:01:56.389> effort<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.689> my<00:01:56.749> part<00:01:56.869> now<00:01:57.529> they're

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
little effort on my part now they're

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.159 
little effort on my part now they're
covered<00:01:57.919> again<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:59.509> let<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.749> sit<00:01:59.929> for<00:01:59.989> another

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.169 
covered again and let it sit for another
