you could do that with

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.520 
you could do that with
fabric<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:10.119> create<00:02:10.299> this<00:02:10.599> look<00:02:10.659> now<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.409> have

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
fabric to create this look now I have

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.910 
fabric to create this look now I have
five<00:02:12.010> piece<00:02:12.579> five<00:02:13.090> strips<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.739> raw

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
five piece five strips that have raw

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.860 
five piece five strips that have raw
edges<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.459> then<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.700> top<00:02:15.969> two<00:02:16.239> strips<00:02:16.629> are

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
edges and then the top two strips are

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.649 
edges and then the top two strips are
folded<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:19.139> cut<00:02:20.139> the<00:02:20.349> bottom<00:02:20.889> layer<00:02:21.609> one<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
folded so I cut the bottom layer one and

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.270 
folded so I cut the bottom layer one and
a<00:02:22.719> one-fourth<00:02:23.139> inch<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:23.980> one-half

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
a one-fourth inch to one and one-half

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.580 
a one-fourth inch to one and one-half
inch<00:02:24.459> wide<00:02:24.730> because<00:02:25.269> I'm<00:02:25.450> accounting<00:02:26.319> for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
inch wide because I'm accounting for

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.800 
inch wide because I'm accounting for
some<00:02:26.639> some<00:02:27.639> Ravel<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.329> then<00:02:28.450> I'm<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.629> going

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
some some Ravel and then I'm just going

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.619 
some some Ravel and then I'm just going
to<00:02:28.870> cut<00:02:29.109> it<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.409> rip<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.370> which<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.299> why<00:02:31.599> I

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
to cut it and rip it which is why I

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.059 
to cut it and rip it which is why I
wanted<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.139> do<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.409> on<00:02:32.469> a<00:02:32.530> straight<00:02:32.829> grain

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
wanted to do it on a straight grain

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.159 
wanted to do it on a straight grain
because<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.909> easy<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.659> tear<00:02:34.900> across

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:35.169 
because it's easy just to tear across

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.220 
because it's easy just to tear across
and<00:02:35.560> tear<00:02:35.739> yourself<00:02:36.129> up<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.459> bunch<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.819> strips

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
there's a lot of strings and also these

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.550 
there's a lot of strings and also these
little<00:03:49.419> edges<00:03:49.780> when<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.049> tear<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.319> are<00:03:50.439> going

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
little edges when you tear it are going

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.039 
little edges when you tear it are going
to<00:03:50.620> roll<00:03:50.919> up<00:03:51.159> on<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.639> I<00:03:52.599> didn't<00:03:52.840> want<00:03:52.989> you

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
to roll up on you and I didn't want you

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.069 
to roll up on you and I didn't want you
to<00:03:53.229> be<00:03:53.439> alarmed<00:03:53.680> by<00:03:53.979> that<00:03:54.009> you<00:03:54.370> just<00:03:54.579> simply

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
to be alarmed by that you just simply

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.259 
to be alarmed by that you just simply
flat<00:03:56.079> iron<00:03:56.349> over<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.189> steam<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.549> so<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
flat iron over it and steam it so that

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.349 
flat iron over it and steam it so that
it<00:03:58.359> all<00:03:58.509> spread<00:03:58.959> out<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> each<00:04:00.519> step<00:04:01.180> each

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
it all spread out so each step each

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.020 
it all spread out so each step each
strip<00:04:02.109> needs<00:04:02.379> to<00:04:02.590> be<00:04:02.709> pressed<00:04:03.040> like<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.699> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
strip needs to be pressed like this and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.509 
strip needs to be pressed like this and
that's<00:04:04.930> what<00:04:05.169> it<00:04:05.439> looks<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.799> this<00:04:06.099> when<00:04:06.400> you

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
that's what it looks like this when you

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.849 
that's what it looks like this when you
tear<00:04:06.759> it<00:04:06.789> and<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.269> looks<00:04:07.479> like<00:04:07.719> this<00:04:08.289> when<00:04:08.739> you

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
tear it and it looks like this when you

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.849 
tear it and it looks like this when you
iron<00:04:09.039> it<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.030> what<00:04:10.269> you'll<00:04:10.419> do<00:04:10.689> is<00:04:11.109> you'll

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
iron it so what you'll do is you'll

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.429 
iron it so what you'll do is you'll
stack<00:04:12.519> those<00:04:12.789> strips<00:04:13.209> up<00:04:13.449> and<00:04:13.689> then<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:14.019> used

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
stack those strips up and then I used

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.699 
stack those strips up and then I used
really<00:04:15.099> i<00:04:15.310> use<00:04:15.969> the<00:04:16.180> strip<00:04:16.449> all<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.690> way<00:04:17.229> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
really i use the strip all the way the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.459 
really i use the strip all the way the
width<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.219> fabric<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.969> there's<00:04:19.329> i<00:04:19.570> still

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:20.469 
width of the fabric and there's i still

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.330 
width of the fabric and there's i still
needed<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.829> do<00:04:21.099> two<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.430> them<00:04:21.789> because

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
needed to do two of them because

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.290 
needed to do two of them because
it<00:04:22.430> means<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.440> here<00:04:24.440> at<00:04:24.560> centre-back<00:04:25.300> I

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
it means that here at centre-back I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.850 
it means that here at centre-back I
didn't<00:04:26.870> have<00:04:26.990> enough<00:04:27.199> to<00:04:27.320> go<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.830> way

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
didn't have enough to go all the way

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.100 
didn't have enough to go all the way
around<00:04:27.949> the<00:04:28.190> sweater<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:29.210> had<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.540> do<00:04:29.750> two

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
around the sweater so I had to do two

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.420 
around the sweater so I had to do two
long<00:04:31.070> strips<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:33.020> had<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.320> make<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.830> set<00:04:34.250> of

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
long strips so I had to make a set of

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.219 
long strips so I had to make a set of
this<00:04:34.639> for<00:04:34.940> each<00:04:35.060> side<00:04:35.389> of<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.570> sweater<00:04:35.990> and

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
this for each side of the sweater and

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.570 
this for each side of the sweater and
what<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.220> did<00:04:37.520> was<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.419> just<00:04:38.810> simply<00:04:39.050> pinned<00:04:39.680> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
what I did was I just simply pinned the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.300 
what I did was I just simply pinned the
end<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.660> stack<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.470> strips<00:04:42.740> up<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.100> pin<00:04:43.280> to

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
end of a stack the strips up in a pin to

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.290 
end of a stack the strips up in a pin to
the<00:04:43.460> end<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.960> just<00:04:45.380> slowly<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.910> was<00:04:47.150> my

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the end and I just slowly this was my

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.740 
the end and I just slowly this was my
first<00:04:47.479> one<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.229> pulled<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.650> down<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.750> I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
first one and I pulled it down and I

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.409 
first one and I pulled it down and I
tried<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.020> layer<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.590> up<00:04:51.800> as<00:04:52.090> neatly<00:04:53.090> as<00:04:53.180> I

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
tried to layer it up as neatly as I

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.280 
tried to layer it up as neatly as I
could<00:04:53.630> because<00:04:53.720> you're<00:04:53.900> working<00:04:54.020> with<00:04:54.229> a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
could because you're working with a

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.340 
could because you're working with a
really<00:04:54.500> long<00:04:54.650> strip<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.810> layer<00:04:56.810> them<00:04:56.930> and

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
really long strip and layer them and

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.350 
really long strip and layer them and
then<00:04:57.620> you'll<00:04:58.040> stick<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> pin<00:04:58.910> in<00:04:59.710> here<00:05:00.710> and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
then you'll stick a pin in here and

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.090 
then you'll stick a pin in here and
you'll<00:05:02.360> move<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.690> up<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.229> then<00:05:03.770> you'll<00:05:03.919> lay

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
you'll move it up and then you'll lay

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.770 
you'll move it up and then you'll lay
down<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> couple<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:04.970> about<00:05:05.270> another<00:05:05.479> five

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
down a couple of about another five

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.379 
down a couple of about another five
inches<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.290> stick<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.530> pin<00:05:06.889> move<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.940> up<00:05:08.120> and

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
inches and stick a pin move it up and

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.390 
inches and stick a pin move it up and
let<00:05:08.510> because<00:05:08.810> there's<00:05:09.020> such<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.710> long<00:05:10.070> strip

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
let because there's such a long strip

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.070 
let because there's such a long strip
it's<00:05:10.550> going<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.880> be<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.000> tangled<00:05:11.479> mess<00:05:11.540> so<00:05:12.020> you

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
it's going to be a tangled mess so you

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.529 
it's going to be a tangled mess so you
just<00:05:12.290> have<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.500> do<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.860> little<00:05:13.040> at<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.250> time

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
just have to do it a little at a time

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.750 
just have to do it a little at a time
once<00:05:14.539> that's<00:05:14.840> all<00:05:15.110> pinned<00:05:15.889> together<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.580> go

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
once that's all pinned together you go

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.490 
once that's all pinned together you go
to<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.090> sewing<00:05:17.330> machine<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.990> stitch<00:05:18.320> it

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
to the sewing machine and you stitch it

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.140 
to the sewing machine and you stitch it
right<00:05:18.740> down<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:18.950> middle<00:05:19.070> now<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.460> should<00:05:20.030> have

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
right down the middle now I should have

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.520 
right down the middle now I should have
done<00:05:20.300> this<00:05:20.419> in<00:05:20.600> white<00:05:20.810> thread<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.289> show<00:05:21.470> you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
done this in white thread to show you

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.890 
done this in white thread to show you
but<00:05:21.770> there<00:05:21.979> is<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.160> stitch<00:05:22.669> right<00:05:23.570> down<00:05:23.750> the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
but there is a stitch right down the

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.590 
but there is a stitch right down the
middle<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.289> then<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:24.979> pressed<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:25.760> actually<00:05:26.330> to

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
middle and then I pressed it actually to

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.330 
middle and then I pressed it actually to
fold<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.530> everything<00:05:27.800> would<00:05:28.010> kind<00:05:28.250> of

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
fold it so that everything would kind of

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.290 
fold it so that everything would kind of
stick<00:05:28.729> up<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:30.130> what<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.160> ended<00:05:31.520> up<00:05:31.669> with<00:05:31.729> is<00:05:32.270> a

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
stick up and what I ended up with is a

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.600 
stick up and what I ended up with is a
nice<00:05:32.600> little<00:05:32.810> strip<00:05:33.169> like<00:05:33.410> this<00:05:33.440> all<00:05:33.979> sewn

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
nice little strip like this all sewn

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.300 
nice little strip like this all sewn
together<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.960> we're<00:05:36.289> not<00:05:36.380> going<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.830> clip<00:05:37.100> this

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
together so we're not going to clip this

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.550 
together so we're not going to clip this
yet<00:05:37.639> because<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.180> would<00:05:38.330> be<00:05:38.479> impossible<00:05:39.169> to

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
yet because that would be impossible to

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.870 
yet because that would be impossible to
so<00:05:40.550> if<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.570> clipped<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:42.020> first<00:05:42.289> what<00:05:43.160> we<00:05:43.310> do<00:05:43.550> is

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
so if you clipped it first what we do is

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.430 
so if you clipped it first what we do is
we<00:05:44.180> place<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:44.900> on<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:45.950> sweater<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.320> when<00:05:48.320> I'm
