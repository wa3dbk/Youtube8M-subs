 l water people selection are found 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.589
 today for a new gameplay at 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 new as in price on the channel 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.069
 youtube I hope that from your side all 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'm fine, it's going to be nil 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 so today for a new video 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 where are we going to talk about fifa 16 guys I 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 other new things to do 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 to share I saw that there the first 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.840
 video had worked extremely well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 especially on community channels 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 where she had reached over 100,000 view 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 so I thank you so much so 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 I hope we will reach the same 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 threshold with this video 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
 and so that's right before I wanted 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.500
 tell you that if you see this video 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.750
 and you want more news 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.980
 on fifa 16.5 to two that I'm going 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.989
 just announce if you want 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 see them go subscribe to my channel 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.739
 the cases I will continue until the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 game goes out so we're always more 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 close to beating the real simply 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 and so we are going to start without more 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 wait for the guys with just 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.750
 women's football which has been formalized 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.329
 so I talked about it in my in my 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 first video on fifa 16 and it was said 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.109
 a lot and it's not possible to football 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.129
 feminine because it's simply 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.390
 not in politics said she 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.789
 it is true that it is not in the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.439
 politics dyed habit of doing 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 involve others others 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.830
 things that footballer football 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.380
 male but so there football 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.760
 feminine has been formalized so 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.549
 players like players like 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 roaming or mizan and 6 for those who 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.960
 know will be present in the game 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 the best football nations 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 women will be there and I think it's 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 really something good that's fine 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.070
 bring us a different style of play 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.299
 if the game is realistic it will be a lot 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 less physical and it's something 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.720
 who can really really be nice to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 play and so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 other novelty guys that's the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.439
 emotions or players who are put 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.790
 forward 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.740
 so apparently they will really 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.840
 really more emotional concrete it's a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.060
 player will be a player would be pissed off he 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.920
 will not have the same he was not running 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.230
 easily to balloon it will be it will be 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.120
 this is ultra think you see this 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.680
 what I mean is what really 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.750
 a feature that can play on 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.090
 the matches because an attacker but 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.410
 for example who is he does not want 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.970
 to go to the balloon it can be very 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.320
 problematic to score but it can 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.060
 to be both very realistic and very 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.800
 very well there will also be a 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.950
 new things new ways 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.710
 defending defense trr which guys so 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.119
 so it's in the displacements it's 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.709
 much smarter ie 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.970
 that players are not going to indulge 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.720
 automatically as soon as they arrive 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.209
 to a player 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.040
 the tackles are improved the players 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.890
 will recover faster after a tackle 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.900
 so it was time for that to happen 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.100
 because when you see it you tackle 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.150
 had the damon balloon not sure of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.640
 have it because the time they get 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.260
 fall as much to eat one we had the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.700
 time to eat at noon watch a match 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.680
 of football we came back he was always 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.270
 not raised and so is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.790
 and so that's it can be the crises of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.830
 really really nice because that 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.140
 can it really really brought 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.790
 a lot it's a new way of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 defense that is because there will be 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.140
 especially for example still one to one 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.330
 aggression review ie 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.880
 can control their aggression if this 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.040
 would be a murderer tackle a tackle more 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.690
 nice where we do not want to hurt ourselves between 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.549
 quotation marks so that can really 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.920
 bring realism and girls to 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.110
 total he told us there would be 25 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 new things about defense 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.890
 where it is enormous it would'll have 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 relearn how to play defensively and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.150
 that's what it is that is not bad 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.769
 because it can we do it 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.900
 to move I think it was time 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.360
 in view of this fifa 15 that novelties 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.100
 like that and the guards also the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.460
 guys have spoken to guards again 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.020
 guards were very much in oil 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.580
 there will be more more dumplings 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.830
 goal passed between the legs 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.840
 it will be much more difficult to 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.890
 mark them read and so much better because 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.170
 there send it constantly from 4.0 d60 17.6 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.000
 of the 4 3 it was boring and a moment when 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.040
 we want we do not buy fissa for 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.270
 realism but for its gameplay but 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.000
 there is a moment when we still want 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.740
 a bit of realism and there it was more than 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.830
 possible goals the das and it starts to 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.730
 to be too much so so much the better iec 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.440
 what has been improved there will be 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.450
 also some thing that has me - who 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.980
 I was very impressed 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.250
 coaches who will be there for us 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.870
 help 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.400
 ie who in the phases of 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.650
 gameplay for a coach who tells us 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.140
 give it to him here here does the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.550
 passion depth center and that that that's it 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.070
 brings a touch of realism that 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.230
 some will like me I do not know too much 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.580
 I do not know what I think because 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.620
 that it's true that I like being 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.180
 free anyway I hope we will not 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 obliged otherwise it would be thing that would be 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.620
 too assisted but apparently not so 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.780
 if we do not have to do it all the better 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.000
 it simply can bring something 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.550
 help thing to those who are new to 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.770
 survival will run so why not 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.000
 other novelties the guys the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.220
 referees 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.420
 the referees have a spray so that's 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.370
 small details but small ones 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.230
 details that I love that is to say that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.330
 details as low in reality it's 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.220
 to say that referees in a spray for 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.750
 the wall for the balloon so I do not know 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.060
 if we can move the ball and the 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.300
 better yet but it's really something 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.380
 thing that will be very very very good and he 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.240
 there will be other novelties like that 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.840
 will last new celebrations of 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.340
 new stages like 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.900
 the new velodrome that was set 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.550
 day it will be there so it's really going to be 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.290
 huge because that's really 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.570
 become a super nice velodrome stadium 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.490
 and he had good way whether it was 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.650
 sure friendly to play in the stadium 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.199
 from marseille the players also 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.820
 been more modeling that is to say that 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.710
 there they have they sought to make a 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.910
 striking resemblance to reality 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.250
 there are some players where we do not see 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.190
 almost not the difference apparently 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.020
 and so here I am always will be 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.550
 slower that's really something 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.360
 good thing like that we'll say radio 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.860
 all right and yes doumbia barvaux and 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.120
 company and munich and all that so 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.410
 it's really good we're going 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.210
 to be able to play with any style 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.710
 attacker and that that really wants 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.729
 certified I just hope that the Santois 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.950
 they will not be back 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.830
 but hey I think it'll do it and 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.620

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.970
