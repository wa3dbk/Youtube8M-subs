00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
basically the third beta should be very

ipad<00:01:08.070> owners<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.549> expect<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
ipad owners can expect a lot of that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
ipad owners can expect a lot of that
those<00:01:09.900> bugs<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.530> fixed<00:01:11.100> immediately<00:01:11.220> an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
those bugs to be fixed immediately an

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
those bugs to be fixed immediately an
iphone<00:01:12.270> should<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.780> even<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.290> bug<00:01:13.560> fixes

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
iphone should get even more bug fixes

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.670 
iphone should get even more bug fixes
fixed<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.580> been<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.390> longer

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
fixed as that's been around for longer

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
fixed as that's been around for longer
so<00:01:16.680> basically<00:01:17.040> should<00:01:17.220> work<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.640> those

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
so basically should work for all those

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.910 
so basically should work for all those
devices<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> wait

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
devices so if you really want to wait

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
devices so if you really want to wait
for<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> better<00:01:20.430> beta<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.780> be

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
for a better beta it probably will be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
for a better beta it probably will be
supported<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.530> iPad<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.009> well<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> should

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
supported for iPad as well so you should

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.730 
supported for iPad as well so you should
wait<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.930> released<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
wait for this to be released or to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340 
wait for this to be released or to
simply<00:01:25.920> update<00:01:26.310> when<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> comes<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
simply update when it comes out as you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
simply update when it comes out as you
can<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> next<00:01:29.130> point<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.939> iOS<00:01:30.360> 7

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
can see the next point is more iOS 7

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
can see the next point is more iOS 7
secrets<00:01:30.869> will<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.320> built<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.770> beta<00:01:32.340> 1<00:01:32.700> we

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
secrets will be in built in beta 1 we

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
secrets will be in built in beta 1 we
saw<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.390> iOS<00:01:33.900> 7<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.500> ran<00:01:34.920> beta<00:01:35.670> 2<00:01:35.939> they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
saw how iOS 7 really ran beta 2 they

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
saw how iOS 7 really ran beta 2 they
added<00:01:36.390> voice<00:01:36.570> memos<00:01:36.990> made<00:01:37.229> everything<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
added voice memos made everything a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
added voice memos made everything a
little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.920> smoother<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> added<00:01:38.880> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
little bit smoother and added more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
little bit smoother and added more
serious<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> also<00:01:40.979> added<00:01:41.250> head<00:01:41.460> movements

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
serious and also added head movements

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
serious and also added head movements
and<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.000> accessibility<00:01:42.750> features<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> move

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and the accessibility features to move

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
and the accessibility features to move
the<00:01:44.159> screen<00:01:44.820> around<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> stuff<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the screen around and stuff like that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.100 
the screen around and stuff like that
and<00:01:46.399> iOS<00:01:47.399> 7<00:01:47.790> beta<00:01:47.970> 3<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.600> most<00:01:48.899> likely

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and iOS 7 beta 3 will most likely

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
and iOS 7 beta 3 will most likely
include<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.860> lot<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.280> features<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
include a lot more features like this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.450 
include a lot more features like this
they'll<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.720> able<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> fix<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.189> bugs

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
they'll be able to fix a lot of the bugs

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.690 
they'll be able to fix a lot of the bugs
naturally<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.990> will<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:55.770> give<00:01:56.250> solid

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
naturally they will probably give solid

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
naturally they will probably give solid
hints<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> devices<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.229> new

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
hints on what the devices the new

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
hints on what the devices the new
devices<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.159> capable<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.060> future

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
devices will be capable of in the future

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
devices will be capable of in the future
they<00:02:01.170> probably<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.829> enhance<00:02:02.189> gaming<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
they probably will enhance gaming and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.090 
they probably will enhance gaming and
stuff<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.780> overall<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.950> going

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
stuff like that and overall it's going

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.080 
stuff like that and overall it's going
to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.219> interesting<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.790> what<00:02:05.909> other

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to be interesting to see what other

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
to be interesting to see what other
secret<00:02:06.479> features<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.960> add<00:02:07.110> I'll<00:02:07.350> update<00:02:07.530> you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
secret features they add I'll update you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.830 
secret features they add I'll update you
guys<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.489> overall<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.479> secret

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
guys with that but overall more secret

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
guys with that but overall more secret
features<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.259> probably<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:11.160> revealed<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
features will probably be revealed and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.370 
features will probably be revealed and
finally<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> pretty<00:02:13.050> odd

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
finally this is pretty odd

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
finally this is pretty odd
this<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.950> article<00:02:14.460> mentions<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.910> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
this but this article mentions that a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
this but this article mentions that a
clear<00:02:15.300> view<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.750> final<00:02:16.050> iOS<00:02:16.350> 7<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.830> in

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
clear view of the final iOS 7 will be in

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.840 
clear view of the final iOS 7 will be in
our<00:02:17.790> hands<00:02:18.630> basically<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.280> sure<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
our hands basically we can be sure that

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.640 
our hands basically we can be sure that
this<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.390> very<00:02:21.870> close<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.440> what<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
this will be very close to what the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.420 
this will be very close to what the
final<00:02:22.890> release<00:02:23.190> will<00:02:23.400> be<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.660> fall

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
final release will be like in the fall

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.890 
final release will be like in the fall
Apple<00:02:26.430> really<00:02:26.880> seems<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.480> releasing<00:02:27.720> these

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
Apple really seems to be releasing these

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.840 
Apple really seems to be releasing these
betas<00:02:28.200> quickly<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.800> should<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.040> making

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
betas quickly so they should be making

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.760 
betas quickly so they should be making
it<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.000> lot<00:02:30.180> better<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.110> every<00:02:31.320> beta<00:02:31.530> we

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it a lot better and with every beta we

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.010 
it a lot better and with every beta we
get<00:02:31.950> closer<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> final<00:02:32.820> release<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.690> maybe

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
get closer to the final release so maybe

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
get closer to the final release so maybe
it<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.350> actually<00:02:34.500> show<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.760> will<00:02:35.910> work

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it will actually show what it will work

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.540 
it will actually show what it will work
like<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> iphone<00:02:37.110> 5s<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.620> iPad<00:02:37.890> 5<00:02:38.160> or

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
like on the iphone 5s and iPad 5 or

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.490 
like on the iphone 5s and iPad 5 or
those<00:02:38.730> type<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.000> things<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.510> we'll<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.260> new

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
those type of things and we'll see new

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.810 
those type of things and we'll see new
features<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:40.920> will<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.220> included<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.670> those

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
features that will be included in those

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.390 
features that will be included in those
but<00:02:42.150> my<00:02:42.720> general<00:02:43.380> thoughts<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.340> do

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
but my general thoughts on this I do

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.620 
but my general thoughts on this I do
think<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> lot<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> bugs<00:02:45.240> are<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> be

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
think a lot of the bugs are going to be

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.700 
think a lot of the bugs are going to be
fixed<00:02:45.960> I<00:02:46.080> do<00:02:46.140> think<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> be

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
fixed I do think it's going to be

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.470 
fixed I do think it's going to be
smoother<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.280> don't<00:02:47.730> expect<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.270> anything

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
smoother I don't expect to see anything

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.850 
smoother I don't expect to see anything
drastically<00:02:49.110> different<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
drastically different I think the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.320 
drastically different I think the
overall<00:02:50.190> design<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.910> features<00:02:51.240> are

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
overall design and the features are

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880 
overall design and the features are
going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> remain<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> same<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.320> we<00:02:52.770> never

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
going to remain the same but we never

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
going to remain the same but we never
know<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.280> may<00:02:53.430> actually<00:02:53.700> add<00:02:54.030> new<00:02:54.330> features

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
know they may actually add new features

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.520 
know they may actually add new features
in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> near<00:02:55.230> future<00:02:55.290> with<00:02:56.190> beta<00:02:56.460> 3<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
in the near future with beta 3 so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.050 
in the near future with beta 3 so
basically<00:02:58.530> it'll<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:59.100> available<00:02:59.580> next<00:02:59.760> week

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
basically it'll be available next week

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.460 
basically it'll be available next week
on<00:03:00.150> July<00:03:00.420> eighth<00:03:00.570> or<00:03:00.720> July<00:03:00.930> tenth<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.350> there's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
on July eighth or July tenth and there's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.960 
on July eighth or July tenth and there's
those<00:03:01.740> are<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.010> some<00:03:02.190> things<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.610> know<00:03:02.730> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
those are just some things to know that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.370 
those are just some things to know that
I<00:03:03.000> mentioned<00:03:03.270> before<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.930> hopefully<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.290> guys

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
I mentioned before so hopefully you guys

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.500
