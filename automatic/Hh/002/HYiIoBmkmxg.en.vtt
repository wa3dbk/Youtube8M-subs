features the folding statues from that
game<00:00:24.710> they<00:00:25.710> had<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> couple<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> different

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
game they had a couple of different

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
game they had a couple of different
functions<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> explain<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
functions which I'm going to explain to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.919 
functions which I'm going to explain to
show<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:29.010> I've<00:00:29.189> duplicated<00:00:29.340> them<00:00:29.929> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
show just how I've duplicated them you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
show just how I've duplicated them you
would<00:00:31.080> sit<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.679> statue<00:00:31.949> at<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
would sit in the statue at first and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
would sit in the statue at first and
would<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.719> things<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.410> would<00:00:34.559> fold<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
would do two things it would fold up and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090 
would do two things it would fold up and
it<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.300> restore<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:36.989> health<00:00:37.200> well

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it would restore all your health well

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.750 
it would restore all your health well
after<00:00:38.340> three<00:00:39.000> hours<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.360> playing<00:00:39.750> around<00:00:39.960> with

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
after three hours of playing around with

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
after three hours of playing around with
better<00:00:41.760> than<00:00:42.000> wolves<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.660> usual

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
better than wolves and my usual

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
better than wolves and my usual
assortment<00:00:43.309> which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.879> better

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
assortment which is really just better

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
assortment which is really just better
than<00:00:45.239> wolves<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> Pokemon<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:46.440> now

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
than wolves and Pokemon so right now

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619 
than wolves and Pokemon so right now
we've<00:00:47.160> duplicated<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.820> function<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.420> let's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we've duplicated that function so let's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
we've duplicated that function so let's
look<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.410> real<00:00:49.649> quick<00:00:49.829> watch

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
look at what it does real quick watch

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.500 
look at what it does real quick watch
here's<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> statue<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.710> into<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.240 

it<00:00:57.510> folds<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.350> gives<00:00:58.710> me<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> handy

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it folds down and gives me a handy

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.639 
it folds down and gives me a handy
Golden<00:00:59.579> Apple<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.030> restore<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.660> food<00:01:01.440> or

this<00:01:03.210> game<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:06.140> here<00:01:07.140> I'll<00:01:07.260> let<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.770> some

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this game so here I'll let you see some

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.990 
this game so here I'll let you see some
of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> contraption<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:11.000> well

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
of the contraption for that it's well

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
of the contraption for that it's well
this<00:01:12.240> one's<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.720> obnoxiously

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this one's kind of obnoxiously

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
this one's kind of obnoxiously
complicated<00:01:13.890> i'm<00:01:14.010> afraid<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.360> look<00:01:15.540> over

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
complicated i'm afraid if you look over

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
complicated i'm afraid if you look over
here<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.470> sort<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:16.979> block

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
here you can see sort of my block

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
here you can see sort of my block

dispenser and Buddy block workshop here

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.490 
dispenser and Buddy block workshop here
the<00:01:23.549> basic<00:01:23.970> premise<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.900> gate<00:01:25.200> right

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the basic premise is this gate right

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460 
the basic premise is this gate right
here<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.299> circuit<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> self

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
here this little circuit is a self

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
here this little circuit is a self
destroying<00:01:28.860> circuits<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.270> when<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> press<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
destroying circuits so when I press this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.380 
destroying circuits so when I press this
button<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.250> hand<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> activates<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
button on the one hand it activates this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
button on the one hand it activates this
redstone<00:01:34.079> which<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:34.950> turn<00:01:35.420> that's<00:01:36.420> off<00:01:36.710> but

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
redstone which would turn that's off but

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
redstone which would turn that's off but
the<00:01:37.770> other<00:01:37.920> hand<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.610> also<00:01:38.790> delay<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the other hand there's also delay that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
the other hand there's also delay that
makes<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> piston<00:01:40.350> destroy<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> rest<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
makes this piston destroy the rest of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.789 
makes this piston destroy the rest of
this<00:01:41.490> circuit<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.150> even<00:01:42.810> though<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.200> exact

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
this circuit and even though this exact

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
this circuit and even though this exact
circuit<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.899> little

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
circuit is not at all in my little

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
circuit is not at all in my little
folding<00:01:46.439> statue<00:01:46.740> mechanism<00:01:47.430> over<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.850> it's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
folding statue mechanism over here it's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.370 
folding statue mechanism over here it's
the<00:01:48.180> same<00:01:48.390> basic<00:01:48.750> idea<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:51.170> there's<00:01:52.170> also

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the same basic idea so there's also

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
the same basic idea so there's also
another<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:53.040> important<00:01:53.549> part<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.909> was

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
another really important part that was

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
another really important part that was
added<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> buddy<00:01:55.320> block

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
added in and that is the buddy block

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
added in and that is the buddy block
this<00:01:56.369> buddy<00:01:56.700> block<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.210> facing<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> Moss

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this buddy block is facing this Moss

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
dispenser Moss stone right here and it's

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
dispenser Moss stone right here and it's
actually<00:02:01.259> even<00:02:01.469> though<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> doesn't<00:02:02.040> seem<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
actually even though it doesn't seem to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
actually even though it doesn't seem to
do<00:02:02.610> anything<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.240> critically<00:02:03.899> important<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
do anything it's critically important to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
do anything it's critically important to
the<00:02:04.469> circuits<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.850> without<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> buddy

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the circuits because without the buddy

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.589 
the circuits because without the buddy
block<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.020> piston<00:02:07.469> doesn't<00:02:07.770> update<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.599> we

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
block this piston doesn't update and we

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.990 
block this piston doesn't update and we
get<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> folding<00:02:10.319> statue<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> end<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.790> looks

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
get a folding statue at the end it looks

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.950 
get a folding statue at the end it looks
like

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
like

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.280 
like
this<00:02:13.170> let's<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.190> look<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.760> action

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this let's take a look at that in action

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.470 
this let's take a look at that in action
the<00:02:16.290> semi<00:02:16.830> final<00:02:17.250> version<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.850> would<00:02:18.330> be

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the semi final version of this would be

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.220 
the semi final version of this would be
minus<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.260> buddy<00:02:19.530> block-<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.760> redstone

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
minus that buddy block- this redstone

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.260 
minus that buddy block- this redstone
minus<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> ma<00:02:22.620> stone<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.000> actually

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
minus that ma stone so that actually

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.030 
minus that ma stone so that actually
lets<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.870> pissed<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.410> circuit<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
lets you see the pissed the circuit a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.730 
lets you see the pissed the circuit a
little<00:02:26.250> bit<00:02:26.400> more<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.290> let's<00:02:28.290> look<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
little bit more and let's look at it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.650 
little bit more and let's look at it
what<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> does<00:02:29.130> again<00:02:29.430> without<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.450> buddy

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
what it does again without the buddy

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.900 
what it does again without the buddy

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
Golden Apple you could hear it but you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.260 
Golden Apple you could hear it but you
couldn't<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.800> but<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:41.850> don't<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.120> an

couldn't see it but we don't have an

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.540 
couldn't see it but we don't have an

in<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> inventory<00:02:46.700> all<00:02:47.700> right<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> why<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:49.800> we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
in the inventory all right so why do we

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.160 
in the inventory all right so why do we
have<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> third<00:02:50.460> one<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.600> third<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
have a third one here the third the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.570 
have a third one here the third the
purpose<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> third<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> can

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
purpose of the third one is so I can

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.760 
purpose of the third one is so I can
sort<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.910> take<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.240> apart<00:02:54.540> show<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.530> bit<00:02:55.740> of
