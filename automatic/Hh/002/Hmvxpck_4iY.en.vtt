00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
interchanged up with my shea butter

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.360 
interchanged up with my shea butter
mixture<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> did<00:03:35.010> know<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
mixture and what I did know as a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.650 
mixture and what I did know as a
different<00:03:35.640> way<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:35.910> shea<00:03:36.150> butter<00:03:36.330> mixture

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
different way in my shea butter mixture

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.650 
different way in my shea butter mixture
and<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.739> twist<00:03:38.459> defining<00:03:38.880> cream<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.480> my

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
and this twist defining cream is that my

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.789 
and this twist defining cream is that my
twists<00:03:41.269> maintain<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.420> definition<00:03:43.079> much

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
twists maintain the definition much

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.949 
twists maintain the definition much
longer<00:03:44.489> without<00:03:44.850> me<00:03:45.030> having<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.390> read<00:03:45.690> twist

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
longer without me having to read twist

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.569 
longer without me having to read twist
so<00:03:46.230> that's<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.590> really<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.130> only<00:03:47.370> difference

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
so that's the really the only difference

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.220 
so that's the really the only difference
and<00:03:48.000> that's<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.299> big<00:03:48.510> enough<00:03:48.540> for<00:03:48.720> me<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.200> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and that's not big enough for me so I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
and that's not big enough for me so I
never<00:03:49.650> used<00:03:50.010> my<00:03:50.160> shea<00:03:50.579> butter<00:03:50.760> mixture

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
never used my shea butter mixture
