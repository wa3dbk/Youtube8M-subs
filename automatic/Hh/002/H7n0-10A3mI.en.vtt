00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.200
 The 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.950
 tee 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.950
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.460
 eaa 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.650
 Of the bicycle will be provided separately stand imposed an alternating current in such as Japan stunt 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 As with the front , take the cap and loosen the hub nut 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:48.530
 If you put a force in this direction, the stand will have an excessive force, so let's drop it . 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.809
 The size of the nut is 15 mm 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 Because it is a size that is not very common in the world, it makes you to cheat with a monkey, but there is good 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.510
 Please 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.140
 Prepare a mega wrench or combination 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.520
 The best is a 15mm ratchet wrench 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.520
 Let's actually do it 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.030
 It takes a lot to see and imagine, but it's dangerous to use it. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.240
 I think I understand 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.130
 The other side is the same 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.620
 Husband front same because here got around even if the inside of the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.070
 We are suppressed with hub spanner 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.170
 Hub spanner uses 17 mm 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.170
 I will return to the stand from a little loose 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.460
 Also takes the four companies one's 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 b ãƒ¼-as well 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120
 The brake is tired of the wire mounting pole first 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.670
 Attention here 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:06.900
 The feathers were at this time 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.900
 Naturally, the blades must be returned to the projections when assembling 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.540
 Remove the fixing bolt of the arm, but what kind of positional relationship each part is in front of the house 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 It is reconfirmed 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.849
 It looks like this from the back 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.849
 I wish I could use a diet, but I 'm not at the beach so I use glasses 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:36.340
 If the back nut is waiting , hold it down with a wrench 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.340
 It is a good efficiency towards some degree loose Once drivers 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.660
 Even if you do not remove Ueno Bolt Un, it is enough to loosen it to some extent 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.150
 reconfirmation 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.150
 This part was in this position 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.959
 Loosen left and right chain pull 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.959
 It is ok without taking natto out 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.319
 If you push the chain and drop it from the location, you may be able to come by yourself if the chain looks at it 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.319
 I will 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.680
 Hmm 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:20.500
 But in most cases you have to drop the chain from the chain wheel 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.500
 Please do stop at Toka driver like this 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.470
 Furthermore, if you drop the Sploque Calabo chain , the chain will be tall enough 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.550
 It is ok if you drank the chain and smoke drone 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.300
 It is then with the way 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.870
 Let's do it because it is the reverse order of when basically removed 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.670
 While taking care of chain pulling while putting a chain 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 Through the hub shaft end 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.769
 Let's put the chain on Sprocket already 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.690
 Let's put a chain on the chain wheel 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.700
 Granko slowly while touching the teeth with a screwdriver 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.700
 It is ok with this round game 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.440
 If it doesn't move, let's remove the chain cover 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.440
 This is easy 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.200
 Chain that I also ride is so let's stick to the rough 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.080
 I will attach Hanyu and so on 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.080
 Be careful because the chain pull is likely to come off from the specified place 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.190
 Adjust the chain tension again 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.120
 In this way, it is necessary for Mama charimente to pack the whole with juwajuwa 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.330
 Because 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.770
 Hold the point and proceed with the work smart 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.430
 Close the hub nuts that had been occupied out with a tool 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.740
 This is also done in far enough to hit lightly 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:18.630
 It's still moving like this 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.630
 Replace the 1 volt with the arm part of the Trump Reiki to band position 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.220
 This is still temporary 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.080
 Here's an easy-to-mistake example 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.920
 Do you know what is wrong is the way 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:38.390
 With this assembly , this bracket will turn so as to pull the brake lever 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.020
 If it is wrong against the correct stop and firmly stop 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.370
 The plight 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.370
 Fix the brake wire 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:54.410
 Pay attention to this part 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.890
 Use this Tongari to shake the wire a little to the right in order to give a moderate firmness to the wire 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.890
 Put 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:04.220
 I'm sorry I just finished tightening here 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:09.409
 Adjust the chain tension again 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:14.360
 You also have to shift the fixed band of the brakes 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:16.950
 It means if sloppy design Mom bike tuning say profound 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.820
 Well let's go without mind 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.820
 Check if the wheel is straight into the frame 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.870
 Each one still needs more to do this work 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:38.130
 Let's get off the stand soon 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.930
 So as not to forget to tighten the lock nut of the lamp-pumped before this tighten the hub nuts 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:45.949
 To do 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.949
 If the chain tension is ok, tighten the brake fixing band as well. 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.630
 This completes the operation check to Once you have tightened with the Chap is the hub nuts
