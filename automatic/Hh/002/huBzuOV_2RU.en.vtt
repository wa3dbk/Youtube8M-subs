00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
actually pretty easy it took a few

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.470 
actually pretty easy it took a few
months<00:00:14.340> um<00:00:14.759> i<00:00:15.480> used<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.199> program<00:00:16.590> called<00:00:17.480> DSP

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
months um i used a program called DSP

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.650 
months um i used a program called DSP
it's<00:00:18.810> actually<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.650> diet<00:00:19.859> solution<00:00:20.010> program

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
it's actually the diet solution program

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's actually the diet solution program
I'm<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> put<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> link<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.150> here's<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I'm going to put a link and here's a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.359 
I'm going to put a link and here's a
picture<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.410> should<00:00:25.680> appear<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> screen

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
picture it should appear on the screen

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.070 
picture it should appear on the screen
um<00:00:28.310> they<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.359> things<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
um they have a lot of things in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.280 
um they have a lot of things in the
program<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.920> helped<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.660> DSP

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
program that helped me I was the DSP

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
program that helped me I was the DSP
manual<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.040> basically<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> main<00:00:36.149> part

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
manual it's basically like the main part

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.319 
manual it's basically like the main part
of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> program<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.950> tells<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of the program and it tells you all the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
of the program and it tells you all the
things<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.750> need<00:00:39.989> foodless<00:00:40.770> charts<00:00:41.370> tables

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
things you need foodless charts tables

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
things you need foodless charts tables
all<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> stuff<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.870> you'd<00:00:42.989> expect<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
all that stuff that you'd expect and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
all that stuff that you'd expect and
makes<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.789> easy<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
makes it easy because you don't have to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
makes it easy because you don't have to
go<00:00:46.590> online<00:00:46.770> research<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.910> salt<00:00:48.239> um

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
go online research at all your salt um

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
go online research at all your salt um
but<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.920> helped<00:00:50.370> me

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but the thing that actually helped me

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
but the thing that actually helped me
the<00:00:50.550> most<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> metabolism

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the most was they have a metabolism

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
the most was they have a metabolism
chart<00:00:53.460> test<00:00:53.879> um<00:00:54.410> basically<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.890> does<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
chart test um basically what it does is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
chart test um basically what it does is
it<00:00:56.370> figures<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.260> metabolism<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.590> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it figures out your metabolism what you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
it figures out your metabolism what you
can<00:00:59.039> eat<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.579> works<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
can eat and what works for you when it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.529 
can eat and what works for you when it
customizes<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> plan<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.370> only<00:01:03.359> has

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
customizes the plan for you only has

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500 
customizes the plan for you only has
success<00:01:04.290> sure<00:01:04.589> no<00:01:04.830> food<00:01:05.309> shopping<00:01:05.880> guide<00:01:06.119> oh

success sure no food shopping guide oh
there's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> quick<00:01:07.350> start<00:01:07.650> guide<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> use

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
there's a quick start guide which I use

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
there's a quick start guide which I use
which<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.360> lets<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> start<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:11.010> away

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
which actually lets you start right away

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
which actually lets you start right away
um<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.530> problem<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.280> was

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
um that was my problem really was

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810 
um that was my problem really was
starting<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> um<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.590> would<00:01:16.740> always<00:01:17.009> start<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
starting it um I would always start and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
starting it um I would always start and
then<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.210> sidetracked<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.320> give<00:01:19.560> up

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
then get sidetracked and I give up

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.510 
then get sidetracked and I give up
because<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.729> made<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> too<00:01:21.180> hard<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.780> myself

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
because I made it too hard on myself

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
because I made it too hard on myself
which<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.880> thing<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.509> takes

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
which is one thing that actually takes

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.880 
which is one thing that actually takes

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that come up stress um situations where

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
that come up stress um situations where
you<00:01:53.430> can't<00:01:53.790> eat<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> foods<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.899> would

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you can't eat the foods that you would

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.560 
you can't eat the foods that you would
expect<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> diet<00:01:56.159> album<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
expect on the diet album so you have a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.700 
expect on the diet album so you have a
workaround<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.799> um<00:01:59.360> I<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.990> if

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
workaround around all that um I also if

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.999 
workaround around all that um I also if
