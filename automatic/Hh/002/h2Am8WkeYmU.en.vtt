potassium and manganese hmm it's
estimated<00:03:28.959> glycemic<00:03:29.959> load<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:32.920> okay<00:03:36.459> my

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
estimated glycemic load is one okay my

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.920 
estimated glycemic load is one okay my
only<00:03:39.489> anti-inflammatory<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.730> says<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.840> I'm

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
only anti-inflammatory it says so I'm

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.140 
only anti-inflammatory it says so I'm
getting<00:03:42.410> those<00:03:42.709> all<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.489> from<00:03:45.040> nutrition

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
getting those all this from nutrition

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:01.220 
getting those all this from nutrition
datacom<00:03:48.459> okay<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:52.630> let<00:03:53.630> me<00:03:53.840> have<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.080> look<00:03:54.410> at

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.220 

no<00:04:01.830> Musso<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:02.430> top<00:04:02.670> would<00:04:02.909> have<00:04:03.230> 13.8

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
no Musso one top would have 13.8

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.800 
no Musso one top would have 13.8
calories<00:04:06.200> 10.3<00:04:07.200> came<00:04:07.500> from<00:04:07.799> carbohydrates

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810

point six came from fab 2.8 came from

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.030 
point six came from fab 2.8 came from
protein<00:04:14.540> okay<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:21.229> let<00:04:22.229> me<00:04:22.260> have<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.710> look<00:04:22.830> at

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
protein okay so let me have a look at

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:32.260 
protein okay so let me have a look at
the<00:04:23.160> sugars<00:04:24.650> hmm<00:04:27.500> there's<00:04:28.500> none<00:04:28.949> listed<00:04:30.889> there

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the sugars hmm there's none listed there

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.730 
the sugars hmm there's none listed there
so<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.990> got<00:04:34.669> omega-3<00:04:35.669> fatty<00:04:35.910> acids<00:04:36.539> and<00:04:36.870> make

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
so it's got omega-3 fatty acids and make

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.730 
so it's got omega-3 fatty acids and make
a<00:04:37.770> 6<00:04:38.100> fatty<00:04:38.370> acids<00:04:40.490> 37.8<00:04:41.490> milligrams<00:04:42.740> omega-6

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
a 6 fatty acids 37.8 milligrams omega-6

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:53.439 
a 6 fatty acids 37.8 milligrams omega-6
fatty<00:04:44.039> acids<00:04:46.100> Wow<00:04:48.289> what<00:04:49.289> is<00:04:49.530> very<00:04:50.010> interesting

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.250 

mr.<00:04:54.449> Ling<00:04:54.720> acids<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.889> present<00:04:56.430> here<00:04:57.260> you

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
mr. Ling acids to this present here you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.909 
mr. Ling acids to this present here you
know<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.770> food<00:04:59.900> might<00:05:00.900> have<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.260> lot<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.590> protein

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
know a food might have a lot of protein

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.120 
know a food might have a lot of protein
but<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:03.570> being<00:05:03.780> assimilated<00:05:04.110> by<00:05:04.530> by<00:05:05.070> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
but it's being assimilated by by the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.320 
but it's being assimilated by by the
body<00:05:05.520> has<00:05:06.300> amino<00:05:06.870> acids<00:05:07.470> so<00:05:07.889> might<00:05:08.849> as<00:05:09.000> well

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
body has amino acids so might as well

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.270 
body has amino acids so might as well
look<00:05:09.660> at<00:05:09.870> how<00:05:09.990> much<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.349> mean<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.620> acid<00:05:10.950> is<00:05:11.099> in

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
look at how much I mean the acid is in

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.839 
look at how much I mean the acid is in
here<00:05:11.900> so<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.139> like<00:05:16.250> okay<00:05:17.250> I'm<00:05:17.789> missing<00:05:19.849> it's

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849
