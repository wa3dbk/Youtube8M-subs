albums wanted to and this is also
something<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.489> showcases<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.390> little<00:04:12.900> bit

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
something that showcases a little bit

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.140 
something that showcases a little bit
more<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.860> dynamic<00:04:14.310> see<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.850> band

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
is able to possess and really a side

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
that they are able to bring out whenever

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.349 
that they are able to bring out whenever
they<00:04:20.010> want<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.180> almost

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
they want and it's one that you almost

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.820 
they want and it's one that you almost
hope<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.900> they<00:04:22.020> would<00:04:22.169> bring<00:04:22.349> out<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> little

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
hope that they would bring out a little

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
hope that they would bring out a little
bit<00:04:23.010> more<00:04:23.510> however<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.599> feel<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.020> they're<00:04:25.169> a

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
bit more however I feel that they're a

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.779 
bit more however I feel that they're a
little<00:04:25.349> bit<00:04:25.500> held<00:04:25.710> back<00:04:25.890> in<00:04:26.099> some<00:04:26.280> portions<00:04:26.700> of

I<00:04:27.120> just<00:04:27.780> perhaps<00:04:28.020> based<00:04:28.530> around<00:04:28.740> some<00:04:29.190> ideas

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
I just perhaps based around some ideas

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.970 
I just perhaps based around some ideas
and<00:04:30.000> some<00:04:30.060> different<00:04:30.780> concepts<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.830> they

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
and some different concepts that they

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.220 
and some different concepts that they
themselves<00:04:32.130> have<00:04:32.610> not<00:04:32.820> yet<00:04:33.270> really<00:04:33.900> figured

out about themselves this is still a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.700 
out about themselves this is still a
band<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.780> feel<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.050> going<00:04:37.440> through<00:04:37.650> a

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
band that I feel is going through a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.320 
band that I feel is going through a
little<00:04:37.949> bit<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.310> growing<00:04:38.639> process<00:04:38.880> and

can tell that there's been a bit of a

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520 
can tell that there's been a bit of a
revolving<00:04:48.120> door<00:04:48.150> whenever<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.260> comes<00:04:49.350> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
revolving door whenever it comes to

revolving door whenever it comes to

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
period of time and that's something that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.330 
period of time and that's something that
can<00:04:53.460> also<00:04:53.729> somewhat<00:04:54.630> discouraged<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.830> real

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
can also somewhat discouraged a real

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.610 
can also somewhat discouraged a real
positive<00:04:56.810> cohesiveness<00:04:57.810> between<00:04:58.500> the

positive cohesiveness between the

positive cohesiveness between the
members<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:59.130> something<00:04:59.430> where<00:04:59.580> everybody

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
members it's something where everybody

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.060 
members it's something where everybody
is<00:05:00.389> able<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.750> bring<00:05:00.990> something<00:05:01.260> new<00:05:01.919> and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
is able to bring something new and

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.620 
is able to bring something new and
exciting<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.729> table<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.240> they're

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
exciting to the table and they're

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.390 
exciting to the table and they're
probably<00:05:03.810> best<00:05:04.350> for<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.650> job<00:05:04.680> but<00:05:05.250> whenever

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
probably best for the job but whenever

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.710 
probably best for the job but whenever
it<00:05:05.580> comes<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.850> that<00:05:05.970> gelling<00:05:06.300> process

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
it comes to that gelling process

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.390 
it comes to that gelling process
sometimes<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.260> feeling<00:05:07.590> out<00:05:07.710> process<00:05:07.740> takes

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
sometimes that feeling out process takes

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.680 
sometimes that feeling out process takes
a<00:05:08.520> little<00:05:08.669> bit<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.880> time<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.389> feel<00:05:09.570> that

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
a little bit of time and I feel that

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.909 
a little bit of time and I feel that
that's<00:05:09.780> kind<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.169> what<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.470> album<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.800> all

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
that's kind of what this album is all

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.740 
that's kind of what this album is all
about<00:05:11.190> if<00:05:11.310> they're<00:05:11.430> able<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.700> maintain<00:05:11.880> this

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
about if they're able to maintain this

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.540 
about if they're able to maintain this
same<00:05:13.020> lineup<00:05:13.320> for<00:05:13.650> their<00:05:13.770> next<00:05:14.070> album<00:05:14.190> after

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
same lineup for their next album after

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.129 
same lineup for their next album after
this<00:05:14.850> one<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.090> really<00:05:15.330> think<00:05:15.630> that<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.960> one's

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
this one I really think that that one's

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.500 
this one I really think that that one's
going<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.350> be<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> vast<00:05:17.040> vast<00:05:17.400> improvement<00:05:18.120> not

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
going to be a vast vast improvement not

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.900 
going to be a vast vast improvement not
to<00:05:18.660> say<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:18.930> this<00:05:19.080> album<00:05:19.410> is<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.530> slouch<00:05:19.910> but

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
to say that this album is a slouch but

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.370 
to say that this album is a slouch but
for<00:05:21.060> right<00:05:21.210> now<00:05:21.240> I'd<00:05:21.570> probably<00:05:21.810> give<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.229> a

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
for right now I'd probably give it a

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.820 
for right now I'd probably give it a
solid<00:05:22.590> 73<00:05:23.580> out<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:24.000> 100<00:05:24.660> i<00:05:24.780> say<00:05:24.990> solid<00:05:25.530> because

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
solid 73 out of 100 i say solid because

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.409 
solid 73 out of 100 i say solid because
they're<00:05:26.520> able<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.820> maintain<00:05:27.000> themselves

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
they're able to maintain themselves

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.270 
they're able to maintain themselves
throughout<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.080> album<00:05:28.470> it's<00:05:28.680> one<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.100> does

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
throughout this album it's one that does

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.850 
throughout this album it's one that does
not<00:05:29.430> dull<00:05:29.729> itself<00:05:30.150> over<00:05:30.990> very<00:05:31.229> quickly<00:05:31.440> it's

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
not dull itself over very quickly it's

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.980 
not dull itself over very quickly it's
one<00:05:32.100> worth<00:05:32.280> some<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.030> ideas<00:05:33.150> can<00:05:33.660> feel

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
one worth some of the ideas can feel

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.529 
one worth some of the ideas can feel
tired<00:05:34.350> as<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:35.190> move<00:05:35.550> forward<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.360> move

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
tired as you move forward and move

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.659 
tired as you move forward and move
deeper<00:05:36.840> into<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.320> album<00:05:37.650> however<00:05:38.340> the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
deeper into the album however the

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.760 
deeper into the album however the
presence<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.510> moonlight<00:05:39.690> sonata<00:05:40.050> portion

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
presence of the moonlight sonata portion

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.710 
presence of the moonlight sonata portion
I<00:05:40.889> go<00:05:41.430> back<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:41.669> that<00:05:41.940> because<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.510> was<00:05:42.690> just

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
I go back to that because it was just

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.990 
I go back to that because it was just
enough<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.919> break<00:05:44.099> in<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.430> action<00:05:44.460> and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
enough of a break in the action and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.240 
enough of a break in the action and
enough<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.870> of<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.169> break<00:05:46.410> in<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.680> monotony

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
enough of the of a break in the monotony

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.820 
enough of the of a break in the monotony
that<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:48.030> really<00:05:48.510> kind<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:49.050> boosted<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.530> album

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
that it really kind of boosted the album

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.080 
that it really kind of boosted the album
up<00:05:49.950> a<00:05:50.039> little<00:05:50.250> bit<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.490> was<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.760> that<00:05:50.849> nice

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
up a little bit it was just that nice

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.760 
up a little bit it was just that nice
little<00:05:51.330> characteristic<00:05:52.050> nudge<00:05:52.349> in<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.620> right

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
little characteristic nudge in the right

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.860 
little characteristic nudge in the right
direction<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:53.490> that<00:05:54.090> really<00:05:54.479> helped<00:05:54.780> this

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
direction I that really helped this

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.350 
direction I that really helped this
album<00:05:55.229> along<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.680> good<00:05:56.010> bit<00:05:56.310> remember<00:05:56.970> gorguts

had it just was kind of baffling to a

had it just was kind of baffling to a
lot<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.450> individuals<00:06:03.990> well<00:06:04.710> guess<00:06:05.070> what<00:06:05.250> that

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
lot of individuals well guess what that

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.879 
lot of individuals well guess what that
really<00:06:05.610> is<00:06:06.000> was<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:06.780> song<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.080> kind<00:06:07.500> of<00:06:07.560> stayed

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
really is was a song that kind of stayed

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.320 
really is was a song that kind of stayed
true<00:06:08.220> in<00:06:08.310> your<00:06:08.340> mind<00:06:08.669> is<00:06:08.940> something<00:06:09.240> that

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
true in your mind is something that

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.480 
true in your mind is something that
you'll<00:06:09.630> probably<00:06:10.020> always<00:06:10.380> remember<00:06:10.919> if

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
you'll probably always remember if

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.589 
you'll probably always remember if
you've<00:06:11.669> listened<00:06:11.940> to<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.030> album<00:06:12.240> all<00:06:12.450> the

you've listened to that album all the

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.240 
you've listened to that album all the
way<00:06:12.690> through<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.200> if<00:06:13.260> you<00:06:13.380> don't<00:06:13.680> then<00:06:13.830> it's

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
way through and if you don't then it's

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.589 
way through and if you don't then it's
just<00:06:14.370> not<00:06:14.580> something<00:06:14.760> that<00:06:15.090> you're<00:06:15.330> all<00:06:15.450> that

just not something that you're all that
focused<00:06:16.020> on<00:06:16.169> but<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.410> lot<00:06:16.590> of<00:06:16.620> people<00:06:16.710> are<00:06:17.010> gonna

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
focused on but a lot of people are gonna

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.770 
focused on but a lot of people are gonna
remember<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.550> because<00:06:17.970> it<00:06:18.060> just<00:06:18.180> seems<00:06:18.599> so

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
remember that because it just seems so

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.690 
remember that because it just seems so
out<00:06:18.810> of<00:06:18.960> place<00:06:19.139> but<00:06:19.530> that's<00:06:20.280> one<00:06:20.520> of<00:06:20.610> the

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
out of place but that's one of the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.940 
out of place but that's one of the
critical<00:06:20.940> reasons<00:06:21.360> why<00:06:21.510> that<00:06:21.660> album<00:06:22.050> really

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
critical reasons why that album really

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.860 
critical reasons why that album really
went<00:06:23.160> from<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:24.300> know<00:06:24.330> just<00:06:24.630> being<00:06:24.750> a

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
went from you know just being a

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.779 
went from you know just being a
tremendously<00:06:25.470> good<00:06:25.650> album<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.190> an<00:06:26.430> even

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
tremendously good album to an even

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.060 
tremendously good album to an even
better<00:06:27.000> album<00:06:27.419> because<00:06:27.780> they<00:06:28.169> took<00:06:28.560> that<00:06:28.830> risk

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
better album because they took that risk

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.980 
better album because they took that risk
and<00:06:29.340> that<00:06:29.430> risk<00:06:29.820> actually<00:06:30.360> paid<00:06:30.570> off<00:06:30.750> for<00:06:30.780> them

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
and that risk actually paid off for them

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.589 
and that risk actually paid off for them
at<00:06:31.229> least<00:06:31.470> from<00:06:31.889> my<00:06:31.950> vantage<00:06:32.580> point<00:06:32.789> I<00:06:33.120> this

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
at least from my vantage point I this

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.240 
at least from my vantage point I this
was<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:33.960> risk<00:06:34.229> that<00:06:34.349> they've<00:06:34.710> been<00:06:34.860> doing<00:06:35.070> for<00:06:35.219> a

was a risk that they've been doing for a
