00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
bit low but what you can do it's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.460 
bit low but what you can do it's
survivable<00:02:22.319> oh<00:02:23.180> yes<00:02:24.180> 0<00:02:24.360> Z<00:02:24.599> seems<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> handle

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
himself decently well trade off for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.009 
himself decently well trade off for
survivability<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:30.090> speed<00:02:30.450> compared<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.989> a

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
survivability for speed compared to a

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.550 
survivability for speed compared to a
lot<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> other<00:02:31.440> junglers<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:33.560> yeah

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
lot of the other junglers but yeah

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.070

that's all I have to show you for zid
he's<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.129> believe<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.579> top<00:02:38.819> three<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.299> in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
he's I believe in the top three now in

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
he's I believe in the top three now in
terms<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.810> speed<00:02:39.989> maybe<00:02:40.319> top<00:02:40.650> four<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.159> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
terms of speed maybe top four of all the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.949 
terms of speed maybe top four of all the
champions<00:02:41.670> I've<00:02:41.849> done<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.540> yeah<00:02:42.659> I'm<00:02:42.750> moving

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
champions I've done so yeah I'm moving

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.250 
champions I've done so yeah I'm moving
on<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.140> next<00:02:43.170> guy<00:02:43.440> thanks<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.860> watching
