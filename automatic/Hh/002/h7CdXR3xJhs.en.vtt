00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.510
 a horse racing reform is a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.550
 racehorse that can not stand 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.280
 profitability as a horse from 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.260
 race I the concept of the second stable 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.570
 luck it was a unique concept in 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.610
 France which addresses two audiences 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.230
 firstly the coaches 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.180
 owners and breeders of horses 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.080
 race and then addressing us a 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.610
 second audience 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.379
 the classic riding riders 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.840
 for which we propose a 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.820
 selection is a job of reconversion 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.080
 on for their own allow to 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.400
 find the horse reforms and 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.640
 races adapted to their practice of 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640
 the horse riding 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.610
 so that's a threshold satin horse 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.060
 who is 5 years old he ran in hurdle this is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.940
 a horse that has been stopped in the race 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.820
 because they succeed and not and from 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.430
 blow they reformed it and we 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.950
 offers between 10 and 40 horses per 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 week and we get two or three in 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.100
 done because the prime objective of the stable 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.870
 it is to save the maximum of horses from 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.560
 the slaughterhouse all the time how 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.980
 rebuild a terbi horse couple 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.980
 behind 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 the paternal to the it is well no 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:10.750
 oh that's our other job of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.610
 reconversion first of all he has for 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.120
 first goal of unpacking the horse 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.490
 shopping 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.100
 for that we act on three axes 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.190
 first of all the environment of the horse 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.590
 so the horse is put in paddocks 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.280
 individual home to promote its 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.560
 relaxation 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.470
 then we act on the diet of the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.470
 horse by a nutrition adapted on 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.720
 participates in rounding up actually the choice of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.610
 make it grow and then we act well 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.770
 obviously on horse work 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.910
 work on foot or the three followers we 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.070
 personally from the blondeau method 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.500
 which helps desensitize the horse 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.180
 to give a code with this one 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.920
 second part which is the part 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.330
 essential is the work on the dish 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.010
 to make the horse aware 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.680
 that his body can serve differently 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.330
 otherwise she avoids and right 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.330
 and then finally we also work on 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.950
 the obstacle to learn them at their 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 learn in peace chained a 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.700
 little trick on the obstacles 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.620
 that's it and we'll take them in 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.150
 outside 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.920
 to show him that we can go 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.920
 anywhere without fear in calm 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 when our horses are sold they are 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.349
 sold during reconversion 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.190
 it's important that cavani that goes 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.319
 buy a horse from us and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.360
 aware that he will have to continue the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.829
 work that we started in the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.150
 same spirit as ours we are always 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.640
 there with our customers to be able to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.640
 advisors on following their choice
