outside<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> weather's<00:01:24.869> like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
outside or what the weather's like

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
outside or what the weather's like
outside<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> widget<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.090> going

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
outside that's what the widget is going

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.460 
outside that's what the widget is going
to<00:01:27.330> look<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:27.990> me<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> Sun

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to look like so for me it's a Sun

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
to look like so for me it's a Sun
because<00:01:28.650> already<00:01:29.400> said<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.790> sunny<00:01:30.000> outside

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
because already said it's sunny outside

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.760 
because already said it's sunny outside
but<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> were<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.110> raining<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.650> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but if it were to be raining then it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.109 
but if it were to be raining then it
would<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> cloud<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.490> rain<00:01:32.729> falling

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
would have a cloud with rain falling

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
would have a cloud with rain falling
down<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.780> were<00:01:33.869> sunny<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.590> clouds

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
down if it were sunny but with clouds

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100 
down if it were sunny but with clouds
then<00:01:35.430> Dovie<00:01:35.820> clouds<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.390> by<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
then Dovie clouds going by so that is

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.319 
then Dovie clouds going by so that is
basically<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.829> widgets<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> top

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
that just means how long ago we got your
weather<00:01:50.790> down<00:01:51.540> below<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.960> has<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.259> highs<00:01:52.409> and

your lows so my high outside is 74

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
your lows so my high outside is 74
degrees<00:01:55.439> fahrenheit<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.219> 49<00:01:56.909> degrees

fahrenheit<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.810> Milo<00:01:58.110> now<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.710> current

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
fahrenheit for Milo now my current

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709
