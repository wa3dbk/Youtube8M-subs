the idea of making your grip better by

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.630 
the idea of making your grip better by
making<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.159> stronger<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.630> one

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
making it stronger is a good one

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.429 
making it stronger is a good one
however<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.570> inherent

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
however there are some inherent

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.080 
however there are some inherent
trade-offs<00:01:53.220> within<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.030> concept

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
trade-offs within this concept

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020 
trade-offs within this concept
the<00:01:56.659> stronger<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.259> get<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.250> longer<00:01:58.850> and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the stronger you get the longer and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.270 
the stronger you get the longer and
harder<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.960> can<00:02:00.079> potentially<00:02:00.470> hit<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.070> ball

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
harder you can potentially hit the ball

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.060 
harder you can potentially hit the ball
but<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.270> more<00:02:02.540> timing-dependent<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.890> will

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
but the more timing-dependent you will

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.120 
but the more timing-dependent you will
be<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.880> hit<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.780> ball<00:02:06.110> consistently<00:02:06.920> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
be to hit the ball consistently and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.410 
be to hit the ball consistently and
accurately<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.830> as<00:02:10.039> we<00:02:10.250> saw<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.880> some<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
accurately so as we saw in some of the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.870 
accurately so as we saw in some of the
previous<00:02:11.840> videos<00:02:11.959> some<00:02:12.950> players<00:02:13.160> can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
previous videos some players can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.110 
previous videos some players can
actually<00:02:14.239> have<00:02:14.420> too<00:02:14.930> much<00:02:15.110> strength<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.940> is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
actually have too much strength that is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.630 
actually have too much strength that is
if<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.840> can't<00:02:18.230> control<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.010> fingertip

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
if they can't control the fingertip

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.050 
if they can't control the fingertip
pressure<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.250> find<00:02:22.489> yourself<00:02:22.819> having

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
pressure so if you find yourself having

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.050 
pressure so if you find yourself having
an<00:02:23.510> off-day<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.709> may<00:02:24.950> need<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.400> ease<00:02:25.670> up<00:02:25.880> on

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
an off-day you may need to ease up on

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.960 
an off-day you may need to ease up on
the<00:02:26.300> grip<00:02:26.660> strength<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.010> get<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.549> better

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the grip strength well you get a better

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.750 
the grip strength well you get a better
feel<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:30.230> tightening<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:30.950> order<00:02:31.610> to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
feel for your tightening in order to

which leads us to the next question
which<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.039> what<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.120> correct<00:04:34.479> grip<00:04:35.050> size

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260

that<00:04:46.840> we<00:04:47.380> have<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.010> use<00:04:48.130> some<00:04:48.400> kind<00:04:48.430> of

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
that we have to use some kind of

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.469 
though equipment and technique has
changed<00:05:10.510> dramatically<00:05:11.880> my<00:05:12.880> advice<00:05:13.210> would<00:05:13.419> be

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
changed dramatically my advice would be

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.870 
changed dramatically my advice would be
that<00:05:13.810> if<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.380> want<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.889> create<00:05:15.190> more<00:05:15.280> wrist

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
that if you want to create more wrist

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.980 
that if you want to create more wrist
flexion<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:16.930> should<00:05:17.139> use<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.380> smaller<00:05:18.280> grip

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
flexion you should use a smaller grip

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.170 
flexion you should use a smaller grip
the<00:05:20.039> consequences<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.070> a<00:05:21.280> larger<00:05:21.699> grip<00:05:21.910> are

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
the consequences of a larger grip are

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.950 
the consequences of a larger grip are
less<00:05:22.930> wrist<00:05:23.260> flexion<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.979> more<00:05:24.960> fingertip

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
less wrist flexion and more fingertip

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.920 
less wrist flexion and more fingertip
pressure<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:27.250> has<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.669> be<00:05:27.760> used<00:05:27.970> in<00:05:28.270> order<00:05:28.510> to

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
pressure that has to be used in order to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.370 
pressure that has to be used in order to
hold<00:05:29.080> on<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.680> racquet<00:05:30.639> handle<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:32.110> with

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
hold on to the racquet handle so with

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.339 
hold on to the racquet handle so with
the<00:05:32.620> lighter<00:05:33.190> frames<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.840> need<00:05:35.020> for

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
the lighter frames and the need for

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.980 
the lighter frames and the need for
creating<00:05:36.160> more<00:05:36.340> racket<00:05:36.760> head<00:05:36.880> speed<00:05:37.210> try

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
creating more racket head speed try

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.200 
creating more racket head speed try
using<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.740> smaller<00:05:39.310> grip<00:05:39.610> size<00:05:40.830> go<00:05:41.830> as<00:05:42.160> small<00:05:43.030> as

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
using a smaller grip size go as small as

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.460 
using a smaller grip size go as small as
you<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.539> go<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:44.349> feels<00:05:44.560> comfortable

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
you can go that feels comfortable

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.550 
you can go that feels comfortable
remember<00:05:47.370> there<00:05:47.820> are<00:05:47.910> no<00:05:47.970> strict<00:05:48.780> guidelines

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
remember there are no strict guidelines

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.900 
remember there are no strict guidelines
as<00:05:49.860> in<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:51.000> previous<00:05:51.650> diagrams<00:05:52.650> in<00:05:53.580> fact

as in the previous diagrams in fact

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.240 
as in the previous diagrams in fact
players<00:05:54.480> shouldn't<00:05:54.840> solely<00:05:55.410> concentrate<00:05:56.100> on

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
players shouldn't solely concentrate on

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.760 
players shouldn't solely concentrate on
different<00:05:56.940> weights<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.450> head<00:05:58.170> sizes<00:05:58.440> of

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
different weights and head sizes of

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.370 
different weights and head sizes of
their<00:05:58.890> rackets<00:05:59.520> they<00:05:59.700> should<00:06:00.300> also<00:06:00.480> consider

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
their rackets they should also consider

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.850 
their rackets they should also consider
trying<00:06:01.740> different<00:06:02.160> grip<00:06:02.610> sizes<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.540> our<00:06:04.350> next

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
trying different grip sizes in our next

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.790 
trying different grip sizes in our next
video<00:06:05.070> we'll<00:06:05.310> look<00:06:05.490> at<00:06:05.670> some<00:06:06.420> good<00:06:07.110> fingertip

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
video we'll look at some good fingertip

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.020 
video we'll look at some good fingertip
and<00:06:07.980> grip<00:06:08.820> strengthening<00:06:09.480> exercises<00:06:10.140> it's

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
and grip strengthening exercises it's

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.870 
and grip strengthening exercises it's
when<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.210> incorporate<00:06:12.720> grip<00:06:13.560> exercises<00:06:14.400> with

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
when you incorporate grip exercises with

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.810 
when you incorporate grip exercises with
fingertip<00:06:15.750> strength<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:16.980> truly<00:06:17.580> will

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
fingertip strength that you truly will

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.580 
fingertip strength that you truly will
start<00:06:18.240> leap<00:06:18.810> frogging

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
start leap frogging

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.980 
start leap frogging
over<00:06:19.890> your<00:06:20.040> competition
