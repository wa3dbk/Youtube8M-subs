 interest 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.060
 today's record 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.480
 during unscheduled 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.920
 I support 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.660
 without waiting 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.360
 trade tale 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 and apply to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.190
 write cadence 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 R 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.579
 This requires that 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:14.659
 by myself 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 especially this has evolved 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.249
 she they just some tail writings 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.129
 when could be performed as 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.599
 individual writings and then it is like a when 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.339
 goals then it is executed at all 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.279
 concert in which it is possible to play 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.540
 what works of mozart can she 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.949
 perceived how to address everything 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:31.959
 concerts 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.409
 that is, not just a mozart concert 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.730
 sounded and the young religion boy was not there in 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.400
 first and last third item arose 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.749
 such a collection 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.009
 and all that this can be perceived 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.079
 as a single big concert in a single 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.019
 style 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.049
 in which may one share can 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.599
 perceived here's how this movie 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.769
 creativity roughly cadence 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.400
 which end of the summer can be served which 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.790
 separating yourself to many people 1 4 leagues mozart 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.819
 Tambov sad series know what 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.900
 most people don't hear the face but in this 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.579
 There are a few sips 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.800
 which we hinted aboard 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.470
 reviewers idea is good so we all 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.180
 We look into the past and the future at the same time 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.180
 so this combination of sales 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.299
 mall is a new fantastic room 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.840
 that is, of course, the artist of the USSR 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.540
 pays attention to the reorganization is possible 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.980
 here is awesome 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.370
 I think this is largely due to the fact that 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.780
 tree outside th 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.360
 on this material gives sound staining 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120
 its special warmth villagers can 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.430
 feel definitely optional 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.720
 verified by applications 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.740
 social card also has a huge 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.730
 There is a lot of value to write 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.340
 modern children it is but the audience 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.430
 first queue interested 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.310
 you can play about this concert hall 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.529
 very soft 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.309
 these sounds of music will penetrate 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.359
 every viewer's heart at any point 

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:46.359
 country 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.770
 modern hall 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.669
 maybe not only in russia he 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.339
 may be considered 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.339
 get a modern room 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.779
 absolutely 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.629
 naturally compete the case 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.389
 Japanese halls 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.339
 seems to me superior 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.339
 already on Wednesday the American Hall 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.610
 due to 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.939
 we will have on hour 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.409
 the hall does not claim to 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.460
 bulkiness 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.759
 can play 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.279
 bright works which 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.370
 3 brightness sound will lose 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.240
 trust dynasty 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.729
 communication with the public 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.110
 even the most famous events 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.370
 these are extremely negative fragility scenarios 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.900
 sounds 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.719
 colorfulness 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.789
 lightest comments 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.839
 i am sure that he 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.219
 bright future 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.699
 would be fair 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.830
 if we tried 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.169
 to plan 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.499
 life on bail 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:08.369
 interesting
