from<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.680> right-handed<00:01:18.130> perspective<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.880> do

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
from a right-handed perspective and do

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000 
from a right-handed perspective and do
it<00:01:19.479> here<00:01:19.630> because<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.960> am<00:01:20.140> right<00:01:20.350> handed<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.890> I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
it here because I am right handed and I

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.520 
it here because I am right handed and I
can<00:01:21.190> do<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> lot<00:01:21.610> better<00:01:21.820> here<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.720> way<00:01:22.900> but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
can do it a lot better here that way but

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.800 
can do it a lot better here that way but
what<00:01:24.190> do<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.340> still<00:01:24.670> see<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.940> lot<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.360> when<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:25.690> do

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
what do I still see a lot of when I do

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.250 
what do I still see a lot of when I do
to<00:01:26.049> grip<00:01:26.229> check<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.740> see<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.930> see

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
to grip check I see I see

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.440 
to grip check I see I see
a<00:01:29.470> lot<00:01:29.830> less<00:01:30.189> now<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:30.700> still<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.180> what<00:01:31.420> I

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
a lot less now but still see what I

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.020 
a lot less now but still see what I
would<00:01:31.630> consider<00:01:31.720> too<00:01:32.140> much<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.549> club<00:01:33.820> just

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
would consider too much of the club just

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.590 
would consider too much of the club just
moves<00:01:34.299> completely<00:01:34.960> moves<00:01:35.380> in<00:01:35.530> both<00:01:35.680> hands<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
moves completely moves in both hands but

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.359 
moves completely moves in both hands but
I'm<00:01:37.750> seeing<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.290> lot<00:01:38.409> less<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.799> it<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.130> that

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
I'm seeing a lot less of it so that

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'm seeing a lot less of it so that
makes<00:01:39.580> me<00:01:39.729> feel<00:01:39.939> good<00:01:40.119> but<00:01:40.600> what<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> still<00:01:40.900> see

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
makes me feel good but what I still see

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.940 
makes me feel good but what I still see
is<00:01:41.680> that<00:01:42.340> still<00:01:42.700> it's<00:01:43.360> too<00:01:43.570> much<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.799> too

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
is that still it's too much I see it too

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.999 
is that still it's too much I see it too
often<00:01:45.159> is<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:46.150> can<00:01:46.840> do<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.590> left<00:01:47.799> hand

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
often is I can do this and the left hand

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.330 
often is I can do this and the left hand
is<00:01:48.130> fairly<00:01:48.430> firm<00:01:48.700> but<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:50.409> right<00:01:50.619> hand<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
is fairly firm but the right hand is the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.749 
is fairly firm but the right hand is the
club<00:01:52.330> just<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:53.830> moves<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.310> way<00:01:54.460> I'm<00:01:54.580> moving

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
club just just moves the way I'm moving

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.490 
club just just moves the way I'm moving
it<00:01:54.970> I<00:01:55.060> can<00:01:55.210> see<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> right<00:01:55.600> hand<00:01:55.780> it's<00:01:56.080> no<00:01:56.259> good

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
it I can see the right hand it's no good

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
it I can see the right hand it's no good
doesn't<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.040> enough<00:01:57.189> grip<00:01:57.340> pressure<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:57.939> in

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
doesn't have enough grip pressure and in

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.719 
doesn't have enough grip pressure and in
many<00:01:58.780> cases<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.409> can<00:01:59.770> tell<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.009> right<00:02:00.520> off<00:02:00.579> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
many cases I can tell that right off the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.850 
many cases I can tell that right off the
bat<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.299> know<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.810> coming<00:02:02.020> we're<00:02:02.770> not

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
even doing it when I see a grip like

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.350 
even doing it when I see a grip like
this<00:02:04.689> where<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:06.310> index<00:02:06.700> finger<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.090> the

left hand for lefty is not even on a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.210 
left hand for lefty is not even on a
golf<00:02:10.929> club<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:13.920> therefore<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.070> means

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
golf club because therefore that means

that that's what we call that I call the
pincher<00:02:40.959> finger<00:02:41.230> or<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.379> trigger<00:02:41.680> finger

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
pincher finger or the trigger finger

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.610 
pincher finger or the trigger finger
like<00:02:42.159> triggering<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:42.939> pistol<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:44.349> trigger

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
like triggering the pistol the trigger

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.920 
like triggering the pistol the trigger
on<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.739> pistol<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.700> want<00:02:45.969> it<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.150> be<00:02:46.299> in<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.719> in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
on a pistol we want it to be in that in

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.390 
on a pistol we want it to be in that in
that<00:02:47.109> video<00:02:47.379> but<00:02:47.680> we<00:02:47.769> don't<00:02:47.980> want<00:02:48.159> it<00:02:48.250> ever

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that video but we don't want it ever

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.789 
that video but we don't want it ever
flopping<00:02:48.969> in<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.120> V<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.349> if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.650> have

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
flopping in the V so if this if you have

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.860 
flopping in the V so if this if you have
this<00:02:50.950> finger<00:02:51.280> off<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:52.030> off<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.299> bat<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.689> do

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
this finger off right off the bat you do

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.319 
this finger off right off the bat you do
not<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.170> your<00:02:53.489> overall<00:02:54.489> your<00:02:54.939> right<00:02:55.120> hand

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
not have your overall your right hand

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.360 
not have your overall your right hand
very<00:02:55.810> likely<00:02:56.049> is<00:02:56.319> not<00:02:56.349> firm<00:02:56.859> enough<00:02:56.889> and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
very likely is not firm enough and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.940 
very likely is not firm enough and
there's<00:02:58.120> actually<00:02:58.510> no<00:02:58.659> control<00:02:59.019> down<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.470> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
there's actually no control down here to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.099 
there's actually no control down here to
to<00:03:00.310> really<00:03:00.459> keep<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.030> club<00:03:01.269> from<00:03:01.750> flopping

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
to really keep that club from flopping

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.199 
to really keep that club from flopping
around<00:03:02.379> in<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.250> V<00:03:03.459> never<00:03:03.730> mind<00:03:04.000> possibly

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
around in that V never mind possibly

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.809 
around in that V never mind possibly
flopping<00:03:04.810> around<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.230> your<00:03:05.409> in<00:03:05.560> your<00:03:05.950> grip<00:03:06.189> so

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
flopping around in your in your grip so

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.339 
flopping around in your in your grip so
we<00:03:06.939> want<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.359> this<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.870> want<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.109> get<00:03:08.200> this

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
we want to get this we want to get this

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.199 
we want to get this we want to get this
wrapped<00:03:08.560> around<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.579> thumb<00:03:09.790> comes<00:03:10.030> on

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
wrapped around and the thumb comes on

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.420 
wrapped around and the thumb comes on
top<00:03:10.419> and<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.930> little<00:03:10.959> figure<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:11.919> triggering

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
top and a little figure like triggering

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.459 
top and a little figure like triggering
the<00:03:12.519> pith<00:03:12.700> trigger<00:03:13.480> there's<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.379> be

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
the pith trigger there's going to be

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.339 
the pith trigger there's going to be
just<00:03:14.769> enough<00:03:15.010> pressure<00:03:15.310> from<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.450> pointer

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
just enough pressure from this pointer

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.440 
just enough pressure from this pointer
finger<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.219> end<00:03:18.340> from<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.090> pointer

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
finger to get the end from the pointer

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.020 
finger to get the end from the pointer
finger<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.889> thumb<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.549> make<00:03:21.700> sure<00:03:21.849> that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
finger to to the thumb to make sure that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.909 
finger to to the thumb to make sure that
the<00:03:22.180> grip<00:03:22.389> does<00:03:22.599> not<00:03:22.840> flop<00:03:23.169> around<00:03:23.409> in<00:03:23.739> that

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
the grip does not flop around in that

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.830 
the grip does not flop around in that
hand<00:03:24.159> so<00:03:24.609> if<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.879> doesn't<00:03:25.030> flop<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.689> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
hand so if it doesn't flop it on the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080 
hand so if it doesn't flop it on the
hand<00:03:26.049> we<00:03:26.230> don't<00:03:26.349> have<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.709> it's<00:03:27.400> not<00:03:27.579> flat<00:03:27.849> if

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
hand we don't have it it's not flat if

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.240 
hand we don't have it it's not flat if
it's<00:03:28.450> not<00:03:28.569> flopping<00:03:28.989> around<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.379> V<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.799> very

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
it's not flopping around the V it's very

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.589 
it's not flopping around the V it's very
likely<00:03:30.430> not<00:03:30.549> gonna<00:03:30.760> flop<00:03:31.030> around<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.329> here<00:03:31.510> and

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
likely not gonna flop around in here and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.449 
likely not gonna flop around in here and
then<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.049> got<00:03:32.169> to<00:03:32.229> get<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.560> hand<00:03:32.829> equal

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
then we got to get this hand equal

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.780 
then we got to get this hand equal
pressure<00:03:33.669> with<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.090> hand<00:03:34.470> because<00:03:35.790> there's

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
pressure with this hand because there's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
like it's holding a hot potato okay so

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.330 
like it's holding a hot potato okay so
let's<00:04:30.820> get<00:04:30.970> let's<00:04:31.210> get<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.539> grip<00:04:32.250> equal<00:04:33.250> in
