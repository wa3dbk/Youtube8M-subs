00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello to all and johnville stone and we get 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.540
 found for new video on the mode 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.860
 dead pixel and in this video I'm going 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.400
 you learn to do this pony a 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.950
 legendary pokemon so it's very 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.110
 simple you just need everything in one 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.010
 bio soft the legendary pokemon in 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.380
 question can arise 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.760
 to hide in an organic I like in a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.680
 old full for itunes the technique is 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.109
 very simple she merchant survive 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.170
 do not worry about this technique 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.560
 is to go up in the sky to 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.480
 the layer 255 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.950
 so here I 'm going to do it by flying 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.450
 creative must go faster 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.090
 is we sure it flies it works very well 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.560
 if you do a little trick or just 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.710
 stack blocks get there at the very top 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.270
 it works very well so we will go in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.840
 up and we'll do the technique 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.840
 so we go up 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.160
 gold after to find the pokemon 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.470
 legendary it's harder what 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.870
 time he may be in the biome from to 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.780
 side what the fouad of bio setting tic 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.040
 finally touch each other not necessarily stack 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 in one where you are shovel in this 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.940
 which is right next 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's a little boring in dread you 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.350
 will not even intervene costs 255 kg 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 legendary pokemon legendary that's it 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.549
 here 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.549
 so now we have to wait 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.650
 so if he wants to sound well after that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.180
 not to start from time to time 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.680
 ten years of stuff in the cat that can 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.860
 help so for example I'm not derailing 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.860
 of that 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.880
 here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.590
 it did not work so I go back down 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.310
 sometimes going back down too 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.310
 pokemon this boys 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 why does it work it works 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.850
 not every time but it works 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 often shone on some servers that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.890
 walk because the legendary pokemon 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.160
 can not ask is how 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.580
 So here it is good I land and 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.580
 I ride 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.580
 here it does not work by going to the diaper 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.830
 255 it can also work in 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.800
 just down you stop as soon as you do not 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.810
 see more clouds roughly in 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.260
 extended distance but to look at that well 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.370
 walked 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.660
 here are layer 140 have almost pokemon 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.990
 legendary to this pony in the biome 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.210
 full and it repeats so the proof that 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.200
 the technique m works in this technique 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.200
 I found them simply 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 I just found myself alone in 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.590
 survival flies a laps in the sky for 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 have fun then I climbed down then 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.150
 it made me that or German if we know 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 I too technical at home t 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.100
 she seek nobody knows this 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.470
 technical gold I wanted to share it 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.600
 I watch them kill if I find it but 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 maybe I did not find him maybe 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.239
 not in this video 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.739
 so I do not like you to shoot the video 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.959
 until I can not find that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.280
 it's going to be too long what the time of 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.890
 find out what times I mean it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.780
 is not at all in the high valais in 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.200
 a bio my side but it is not stack 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.050
 in yours that's annoying 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.050
 in addition I have a budget no no 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.599
 I do not see 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.739
 as I failed on video in map a 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.739
 took a long time to load 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.720
 so 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.920
 but well after you have to search so you 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.350
 have proof that the technique she 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.600
 market 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.340
 I come from the air is like that me in 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.340
 my giant world hugo I you 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.990
 I spoke I found rail rapeseed bio 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.990
 full I found 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.579
 arctic odin in an organic but extremely 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.700
 if I will do it in his bio guys 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.700
 RPM and miou in an organic m'bengue 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.780
 I do not see no I'm not trying to 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.750
 technical one last end another one 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.500
 once we find by aicha bah too bad 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.500
 I will stop video 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.080
 just have to look you must finally see 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.150
 months before I came across better I had to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.500
 to do before finding what already he 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.630
 is small to find in a bio but 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.010
 of course everything that was in my world 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:49.200
 Huge miou the technique him to do 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.200
 about 20 25 times before finding 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.990
 so it can seem long 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.340
 but when we have it necessarily seems 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.060
 long when you search but when you 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.680
 look what not that far its 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.080
 do you stump if you wait for it to happen 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.979
 poses naturally 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.789
 like that so that's hilarious spawn and no 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.789
 I do not see him 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.860
 if I do not find it does not matter 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.469
 and if we come to live 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.729
 I'm not seeing them here just now 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.370
 I 'm going to music 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.370
 okay 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.670
 lowrie quad that 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.419
 woods a right there as illzach 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.580
 it's not too much here so bah I you 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.050
 let's look for it you find 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.050
 even in your parts 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.889
 hop silverstone is 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:32.289
 in creative I 'm going to show you the 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:34.009
 colony so that's it I believe for this 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.699
 pole 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:41.860
 space the name of the pokemon so rail 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.860
 airways for example 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.540
 so here that lag is here he is the voice there 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.870
 I just made this pony nothing at 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.120
 hazard 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.720
 so when you capture it you 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.190
 will be able to ride on his back so after 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:03.810
 if you want chained six low matches 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:06.689
 rail that all about what would be beautiful 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.689
 this pole 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.689
 at 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.490
 slash pokÃ© spawn raic wazza space s 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:19.650
 as shine is alas you will have it 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.650
 chained here is 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.900
 so I was also to specify the mode and 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.520
 English so if you type the name and 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.520
 pokemon in french it may not be ok 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.780
 market it's not going to work with wade enough 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.529
 especially in English and French 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:40.090
 it's the same so here it is 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:43.389
 the end of this tutorial 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:47.160
 and I hope that we will meet again 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:49.490
 on another video soon 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:54.610
 here 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.610
 so I tell you more and that him
