00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello today i will show you how to enter 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.910
 dashboard opel corsa d 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.320
 diagnostic mode to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 view exact engine temperature 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 on different forums they write very much 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.420
 quick start engine push 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 something dramatically nothing really 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.539
 don't we just take 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.539
 turn the key 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.390
 we start quietly here we look here 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:49.559
 there is such a button to reset the odometer but 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.270
 and in fact she introduces 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 diagnostic mode our tidy 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.820
 you need to press three times short 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 one time long hold more than 10 seconds 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 actually better to keep readings 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 on the sensor but this digital not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.970
 will change 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.810
 press three times 4 long 1 2 3 4 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 we hold we can even count 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.369
 4 3 2 1 here it caught fire 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 I will describe these modes in more detail later. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.020
 we have a mode that shows 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.229
 the temperature 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.759
 is the sixth in a row this is 1 2 3 4 4 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 actually shows the number of gates 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.500
 now for some reason they play 330 340 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.130
 should be set to 800 as far as i am 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.130
 I know, but it's not like that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.790
 89 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.650
 the top value of 0 is our interest 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.290
 I will turn on the lights now 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.660
 percent of me exhibited backlight 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.620
 tidy here can be changed and that's brighter 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.990
 quieter 89 is the temperature of our engines 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 now why such a temperature because 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.010
 what just mass really 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.010
 drowned out the car here 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.909
 always without an onboard computer can 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.900
 find out the exact temperature on the courses there 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.900
 some problem 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.189
 periodically out of order resistor 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.400
 fan on 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:51.750
 here by the way we came Gaziz you cost 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.549
 1480 rubles in my stores here I have it 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.680
 not found so I had to purchase 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:01.790
 through existential that's all 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.790
 Thanks for attention
