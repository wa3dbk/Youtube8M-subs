lot cutting in this brush as well as
other<00:00:32.290> spots<00:00:32.880> would<00:00:33.880> be<00:00:34.090> like<00:00:34.270> behind<00:00:34.810> blinds

sometimes called a tight spot roller you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.430 
sometimes called a tight spot roller you
can<00:00:48.040> use<00:00:48.250> this<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.820> get<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.210> lot<00:00:49.510> closer<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:50.290> its

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
can use this to get a lot closer to its

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:01.680 
can use this to get a lot closer to its
name

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.730 

here<00:01:03.400> across<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.670> top<00:01:04.990> there's<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.110> while<00:01:06.380> to

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
here across the top there's a while to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.390 
here across the top there's a while to
get<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.100> there<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:08.350> lot<00:01:09.350> closer<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:09.950> minimize

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
get in there a lot closer and minimize

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:25.600 
get in there a lot closer and minimize
how<00:01:13.400> much<00:01:13.430> brush<00:01:13.880> work

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.900 

you'll<00:01:26.270> need<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.690> there<00:01:26.930> will<00:01:27.140> pick<00:01:27.910> again

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
you'll need that there will pick again

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:43.630 
you'll need that there will pick again
so<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.480> drag<00:01:32.440> into<00:01:33.440> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:55.530 

but<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:44.720> be<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.140> much<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:52.520> much<00:01:52.729> less

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.540 

using<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.630> brush<00:02:02.680> definitely<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> very<00:02:03.979> useful

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
using the brush definitely a very useful

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.480 
using the brush definitely a very useful
tool<00:02:05.060> especially<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:06.440> have<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.650> lot<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.130> area

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
tool especially you have a lot of area

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.630 
tool especially you have a lot of area
to<00:02:07.550> pincus's<00:02:08.209> few<00:02:08.630> things<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.640> considerably

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
to pincus's few things up considerably

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:25.570 
to pincus's few things up considerably
because<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.380> much<00:02:12.530> closer<00:02:24.580> again

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
because you can get so much closer again

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.270 
because you can get so much closer again
make<00:02:25.850> an<00:02:26.060> easier<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.950> brush<00:02:28.220> work<00:02:28.459> for<00:02:28.760> you

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
make an easier to the brush work for you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.790 
make an easier to the brush work for you
so<00:02:31.280> now<00:02:31.370> I'll<00:02:31.550> switch<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.060> brush<00:02:32.800> I'll

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
so now I'll switch to the brush I'll

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.270 
so now I'll switch to the brush I'll
just<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.340> roller<00:02:35.140> wet<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.769> doesn't<00:02:37.100> dry

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
just get my roller wet so it doesn't dry

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:50.370 
just get my roller wet so it doesn't dry
out

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.699 

maybe<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.629> was<00:03:08.780> still<00:03:09.019> going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> get<00:03:09.439> there

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
maybe if I was still going to get there

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:36.790
