00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.390
 I am an Oscar and today I bring you 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:05.500
 a very special review because you 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.910
 they asked me because you 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.740
 they requested and because I'm copying to 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.200
 Malikite I just took 3 cups of coffee 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.269
 and I feel very hyperactive and I come to you 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.009
 to talk about eleanor parker written 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.109
 by raymond roussel post here in 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.449
 mexico by who knows what editorial 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.029
 It costs 239 pesos in any bookstore 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.310
 it's a come book that you can get 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.859
 with hands crossed behind the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.939
 back and if the synopsis is very simple 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.789
 it's about two characters from 15 to 16 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.940
 very typical years not far from the 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.699
 stereotype we have him and for him no longer 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.160
 is the new girl the chubby the rare the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.559
 that dresses very strangely what is 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 very cruel is not very cruel to his 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.770
 opinions because it's very sarcastic the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.050
 What is it 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.370
 it moves away from society not if it does not 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.130
 like to be in company has a 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.170
 family in a state of decomposition 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.880
 broken and that brings a kind of 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.700
 special mix to the story 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.720
 marc marquez the Korean boy good my 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.830
 tractor is no longer Asian half Asian 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.560
 schwartz likes to dress in black 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.720
 like bands like karate or 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 good practice karate better said 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.920
 like comics is comic erol se la la 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.400
 spend reading comics all day and with 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.500
 that conquers the girl I guess I 'm 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.410
 strange of the story the truth as I already 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.720
 I said are characters are characters 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.160
 strangers but from there you have to do 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.950
 weird robots that plowed a story of 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.630
 love to weigh to be opposite poles in 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 the kids know the school bus 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.479
 it's strange because in no sacred are 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.850
 very cold very closed it corrupts the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.680
 opinion and do not talk to each other they start 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 to know without words and how they listened 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.340
 speechless 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.740
 it's strange to know each other but you know 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.320
 This is how the love story arises. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.820
 opinion seemed little because he has always 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 seen that we have with these classes 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.219
 opinions do not calm him down that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.020
 breathe the story I thought it was bad 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.630
 love story seemed bad to me 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.429
 beginning as the story progresses and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 already up half the book I 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.660
 a story seems a mature story 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 ripe 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.770
 young characters that are practically 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.990
 in reverse adolescent children wanting 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.590
 being adults is a kind of psychology 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.840
 I liked it because it is denoted 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.610
 that are still children in the background yes 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.790
 even though they do actions 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.160
 adults like wanting to be saved and so I do not know 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.770
 it's strange that 's what I did not like in 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.290
 the story because it takes 30 chapters 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.440
 in doing this that is known in the first 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.900
 chapter and treated take 30 chapters 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 in holding hands in the afternoon in 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.280
 interlacing it seems a worthy story 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.320
 of a 12- year-old adolescent who 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.510
 he wrote when he was that age ramÃ³n 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.890
 I do not know the truth and exaggerating 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 liked the story but as I say to the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.240
 principle in very difficult version of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.490
 follow the flow despite being 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.040
 small chapters of 34 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.590
 pages but I found it very 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.330
 exasperating as well as my attitude when 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.820
 I drink real coffee 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.220
 It's weird but I do not want it to last 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.620
 both the video really good there is something 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.630
 positive in the book that I liked in 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.670
 what is the history of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 bullying both the one he receives at home 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.170
 the mistake with his father with his mother with 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.120
 his brothers would see the truth now what 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.530
 only problematic is the father to simple 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.380
 view although the mother is also a 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.680
 witch nothing is true but the father follows 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.890
 the stepfather better said and with his father 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.410
 Real is also exasperating and I liked it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.500
 I liked that and also when he's in 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.830
 compact school over tub and the other 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.580
 steve the new cord will be called but if 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.370
 is a kind of bullying of what is 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.770
 in fashion right now and I like it as the youngest 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.010
 have to suffer how to live with that 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.140
 as a kind of garden is a kind 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.000
 very similar story but obviously the 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.800
 environment you can be genetic 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.040
 is to kill all true 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.890
 but if she wants to do it she 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.440
 endure what he endures he follows him with his life 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:18.410
 Suffers to cry open in your notebook 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.230
 tantrums in his room and good treats 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.030
 to follow everything forward 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.640
 I loved the story when both 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.980
 they were separated because you knew more 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.470
 intimately to each character you put 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.860
 a soul a voice a body to the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.350
 characters you knew how to act when 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.750
 they were when they were together was to leave 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.180
 that your hand is enough 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.100
 and I was desperate because that was very 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.480
 very corny to the love story at 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.530
 beginning 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.310
 I would not skip the first 30 chapters 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.650
 do not skip those chapters but 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.710
 Hold it is not worth it and the end 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.990
 open 1 the open end very open 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.130
 in my opinion, so many 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.520
 things there are many theories and if I keep 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.510
 many things because there's going to be hangout and 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.360
 the money in parc around here I'll be 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.150
 leaving my twitter and the channel in which 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.190

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.470
 hour but you have to go to come to

 Greet us to tell us what is your opinion 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.090
 of history because there are many things 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.970
 I want to discuss and I do not want them 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.700
 talk all here and good a lot of coffee 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.920
