00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
so that one's kind of nice just for
spring<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.740> definitely<00:02:02.600> sort<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
spring because it's definitely sort of

you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.490> see<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.240> kind<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.540> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you can see here that it's kind of a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.960 
you can see here that it's kind of a
like<00:02:18.920> Matt<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:20.300> more<00:02:20.990> opaque<00:02:21.730> coral<00:02:22.730> color

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
like Matt like more opaque coral color

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.510 
like Matt like more opaque coral color
and<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.840> actually<00:02:24.320> really<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.310> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
and I actually really like this and I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.370 
and I actually really like this and I
probably<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.150> going<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.960> be<00:02:27.050> wearing<00:02:27.260> this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
probably I'm going to be wearing this

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.310 
probably I'm going to be wearing this
quite<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> bit<00:02:28.000> definitely<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> color<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:30.140> if

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
quite a bit definitely a color that if

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.660 
quite a bit definitely a color that if
you're<00:02:30.470> looking<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.860> nice<00:02:31.070> coral<00:02:31.490> it's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
you're looking for a nice coral it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.000 
you're looking for a nice coral it's
this<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:32.930> worn<00:02:33.200> alone<00:02:33.350> obviously

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
this one can be worn alone obviously

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.010 
this one can be worn alone obviously
mixed<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.520> with<00:02:34.670> other<00:02:34.850> colors<00:02:35.120> too<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:35.840> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
mixed in with other colors too but I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.930 
mixed in with other colors too but I
think<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.500> really<00:02:36.980> nice<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.760> its

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
think this is really nice just on its

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.820 
think this is really nice just on its
own<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.750> okay<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.590> one

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
own like that so okay so then this one

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.860 
own like that so okay so then this one
is<00:02:39.860> clockwork<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.510> kind<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
is clockwork and this is kind of the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.960 
is clockwork and this is kind of the
fourth<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.250> see<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.670> difference

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
fourth one so you can see the difference

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.460 
fourth one so you can see the difference
between<00:02:44.060> Anika<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.840> definitely<00:02:45.140> more<00:02:45.260> like

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
between Anika it's definitely more like

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.450 
between Anika it's definitely more like
an<00:02:45.590> orgy<00:02:45.770> terracotta<00:02:46.670> kind<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.570> coral<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:49.040> think

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
an orgy terracotta kind of coral I think

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.560 
an orgy terracotta kind of coral I think
this<00:02:49.580> one<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.090> look<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.270> lot<00:02:50.390> better

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
this one is going to look a lot better

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.930 
this one is going to look a lot better
on<00:02:50.720> some<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.320> darker<00:02:51.680> skin<00:02:51.920> tones<00:02:52.160> olive

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
skin tones um for me it looks pretty

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.250 
skin tones um for me it looks pretty
orange<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.850> my<00:02:55.970> camera<00:02:56.360> but<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:56.690> actually

blueberry shimmer in it this one is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.680 
blueberry shimmer in it this one is
definitely<00:03:30.830> kind<00:03:31.460> of<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.850> reminiscent<00:03:32.600> of

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
definitely kind of like reminiscent of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.290 
definitely kind of like reminiscent of
the<00:03:32.750> 80s<00:03:33.170> at<00:03:33.410> least<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.710> me<00:03:33.830> um<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:35.060> actually

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
the 80s at least to me um it actually

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.670 
the 80s at least to me um it actually
lends<00:03:35.780> itself<00:03:35.990> pretty<00:03:36.200> good<00:03:36.440> with<00:03:36.590> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
lends itself pretty good with the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.230 
lends itself pretty good with the
eyeshadow<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.160> are<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.670> look<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.210> I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
eyeshadow that are the I look that I

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.090 
eyeshadow that are the I look that I
have<00:03:38.390> on<00:03:38.510> right<00:03:38.630> now<00:03:38.690> which<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.560> why<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:39.800> wore

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
have on right now which is why I wore

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.380 
have on right now which is why I wore
this<00:03:40.250> suit<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.520> figured<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.850> would<00:03:40.940> be<00:03:40.970> neutral

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390

this suit I figured it would be neutral
with<00:03:41.510> everything<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.170> um<00:03:43.060> not<00:03:44.060> my<00:03:44.300> favorite

retro<00:05:04.590> sci-fi<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.490> think<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.810> black<00:05:07.050> is

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
retro sci-fi I think the black is

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.590 
retro sci-fi I think the black is
obviously<00:05:07.710> very<00:05:07.800> sort<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.460> sci-fi<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:09.210> then

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
obviously very sort of sci-fi and then

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.480 
obviously very sort of sci-fi and then
these<00:05:09.720> colors<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.260> find<00:05:10.560> our<00:05:10.950> kind<00:05:11.250> of<00:05:11.340> your
