00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
mean the fire really does do a ton to
him<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> think<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.979> should<00:01:38.130> probably<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.820> up

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
him so I think we should probably go up

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.450 
him so I think we should probably go up
to<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.180> 10<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.869> he<00:01:40.680> actually<00:01:40.950> broke<00:01:41.220> my

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to like 10 now he actually broke my

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.080 
to like 10 now he actually broke my
arena<00:01:41.729> when<00:01:42.060> he<00:01:42.119> stomped<00:01:43.220> it<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.460> gonna<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.790> 10

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
arena when he stomped it is gonna be 10

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
arena when he stomped it is gonna be 10
cubies<00:01:45.750> against<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.470> snow<00:01:47.009> beast<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.759> I

look<00:03:33.699> like<00:03:33.879> it's<00:03:34.030> got<00:03:34.150> off<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:35.019> close<00:03:35.409> though

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
look like it's got off so close though

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.409 
look like it's got off so close though
but<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.400> your<00:03:36.489> guess<00:03:36.669> was<00:03:36.819> ten<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.299> was

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
but if your guess was ten that was

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.819 
but if your guess was ten that was
pretty<00:03:37.690> much<00:03:37.900> right<00:03:38.169> I<00:03:38.229> mean<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:38.590> did

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
pretty much right I mean they did

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.770 
pretty much right I mean they did
actually<00:03:39.400> kill<00:03:39.639> him<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.909> first<00:03:40.120> time<00:03:40.359> they

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
actually kill him the first time they

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.520 
actually kill him the first time they
did<00:03:40.959> die<00:03:41.199> too

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
did die too

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.860 
did die too
so<00:03:41.889> I'd<00:03:42.129> say<00:03:42.340> 10<00:03:42.579> or<00:03:42.699> 11<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.209> you've

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
