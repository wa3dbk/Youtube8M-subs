00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:05.259
 Bieringer and Raggae in 2200 the classic microphone preamp 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.460
 Inc lower price range for over ten years there would be yes 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.970
 meanwhile this preamp and an end is not in sight why he too 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.590
 certainly does not have the warmest sound and also the distance is a little bit 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.040
 higher than for appliances in the ten thousand Euro class APA the water 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.369
 if I want to amplify the signal precisely he is doing superbly 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.880
 but now to the details of these both live and for recording purposes 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.019
 used 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.869
 purpose weapon 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.350
 Chans once the button on the front panel of this 2-channel microphone 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.760
 Preamplifier St 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
 which gives it a line nick switch so not only with the phone but 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.430
 Also devices means a level can be connected quite 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.100
 By the way, they also signal with 14 of the Ultrac 2200 and can thus as 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.050
 Full-featured iBooks are ideal for example for old ones 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.650
 Word on a stage 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.240
 above that is the key for the 48 volt phantom power 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.340
 Capacitor to operate microphones 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 a dungeon uribe as a switch to possibly phrases pig after 1 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 us a controllable Luca are of course just as present as the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.390
 parametric 3-band EQ more quietly switchable over one in off fast 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.840
 or excrete but the IQ of course offers more so you can 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.620
 wants to fit over the factors intervention area 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.280
 determined simply and effectively 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.869
 it promotes hearts and up to 20 kilohertz are available here 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.340
 but also the flank is old and the filter would be under separate 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.800
 Eger adjustable 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.860
 what would a preamp without a rule Bonner preamp and a 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.310
 Complete offer of the quake 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 Of course, the Währinger has extremely precise 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.990
 Adjustments for both 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.030
 take a quick look at the tidy back of the device 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.080
 here are inputs and outputs for microphones 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.940
 and the line of course, as an individual success at risk 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 The workmanship is less fortunate beyond doubt 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.050
 Many manufacturers look at energy values ​​and maybe even more 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.250
 learn something 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.750
 from some of you demonized by others I'm sure you praised the clover 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 Truth probably as always in the middle because fact is with the desk AG he represents 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.510
 her an exceptional comfort for this price range 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.540
 preamplifier 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.760
 with many thoughtful features
