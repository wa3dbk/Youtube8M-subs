about four inches or so right into the
very<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.110> front<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.650> enough<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.670> where<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
very very front here enough to where you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.790 
very very front here enough to where you
can<00:01:17.910> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> slick<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> back<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.990> slick<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
can kind of slick it back and slick it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980 
can kind of slick it back and slick it
over<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.670> edit<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.210> texture<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.780> top

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
over then edit some texture to the top

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.360 
over then edit some texture to the top
just<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.320> chipping<00:01:22.620> into<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.130> bit

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
just by chipping into it a little bit

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.660 
just by chipping into it a little bit
and<00:01:23.520> basically<00:01:24.480> you've<00:01:24.690> got<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.890> style<00:01:26.159> now

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and basically you've got this style now

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
and basically you've got this style now
for<00:01:27.000> styling<00:01:27.870> it<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
for styling it we're going to do is just

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.860 
for styling it we're going to do is just
you<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.220> blow<00:01:29.400> dry<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:30.090> coming

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
you want to just blow dry it over coming

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.930 
you want to just blow dry it over coming
this<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.580> use<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.730> little

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
this way and then you can use a little

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.469 
this way and then you can use a little
bit<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.150> dry<00:01:33.360> paste<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.110> finish<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
