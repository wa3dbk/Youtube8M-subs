so<00:03:27.980> Hank<00:03:28.250> he<00:03:28.550> protects<00:03:28.970> his<00:03:29.150> team<00:03:29.360> in<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.750> very

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
so Hank he protects his team in a very

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.649 
so Hank he protects his team in a very
defensive<00:03:30.650> way<00:03:30.830> he<00:03:31.190> directly<00:03:31.760> shields

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
defensive way he directly shields

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.720 
defensive way he directly shields
somebody<00:03:33.019> who's<00:03:33.260> under<00:03:33.560> attack<00:03:33.890> bucket<00:03:34.370> also

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
somebody who's under attack bucket also

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.339 
somebody who's under attack bucket also
protects<00:03:35.090> his<00:03:35.269> team<00:03:35.480> but<00:03:35.720> he<00:03:35.780> does<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.230> an

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
protects his team but he does it in an

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.140 
protects his team but he does it in an
offensive<00:03:36.739> way<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.519> it's<00:03:37.700> kind<00:03:37.909> of<00:03:37.970> cool

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
offensive way so it's kind of cool

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.119 
offensive way so it's kind of cool
because<00:03:38.299> that's<00:03:39.170> what<00:03:39.319> supports<00:03:39.709> supposed<00:03:39.980> to

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
because that's what supports supposed to

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.949 
because that's what supports supposed to
do<00:03:40.280> find<00:03:40.549> ways<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.849> protect<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.330> team<00:03:41.540> but

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
do find ways to protect the team but

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.059 
do find ways to protect the team but
they're<00:03:42.080> doing<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.409> in<00:03:42.530> completely<00:03:42.950> different

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
they're doing it in completely different

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:54.870 
they're doing it in completely different
ways<00:03:45.519> apparently<00:03:46.519> I'm<00:03:46.849> pretty<00:03:47.180> good<00:03:47.390> at<00:03:47.450> this

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.380 

the<00:03:55.780> dam<00:03:56.050> is<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.710> new<00:03:56.950> map<00:03:57.460> that<00:03:57.820> we're<00:03:58.030> showing

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the dam is a new map that we're showing

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.840 
the dam is a new map that we're showing
people<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.960> dam<00:03:59.800> is<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.370> desert<00:04:00.790> environment

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
people the dam is a desert environment

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.970 
people the dam is a desert environment
so<00:04:01.510> there<00:04:01.900> are<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.050> lot<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.230> caves<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.770> lot<00:04:02.860> of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
so there are a lot of caves a lot of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.920 
so there are a lot of caves a lot of
twisting<00:04:03.340> caves<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:04.000> little<00:04:04.330> more<00:04:04.480> vertical

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
twisting caves a little more vertical

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.120 
twisting caves a little more vertical
than<00:04:04.960> the<00:04:05.140> other<00:04:05.290> mass<00:04:05.470> we've<00:04:05.710> shown<00:04:05.920> and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
than the other mass we've shown and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.710 
than the other mass we've shown and
there's<00:04:06.340> also<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.550> lot<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.820> very<00:04:07.120> tight<00:04:07.510> and

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
there's also a lot of very tight and

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.350 
there's also a lot of very tight and
closed<00:04:08.080> spaces<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.090> things<00:04:10.270> that's

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
closed spaces one of the things that's

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.580 
closed spaces one of the things that's
really<00:04:10.540> going<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.840> stand<00:04:11.080> out<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> lot<00:04:11.500> of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
really going to stand out to a lot of
