a<00:00:21.270> video<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.340> tricky<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> find

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
a video and it was a bit tricky to find

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.400 
a video and it was a bit tricky to find
because<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.390> thumbnail<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.140> video

hard<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> find<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.570> found<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.990> they've

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
hard to find but we found it they've

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
hard to find but we found it they've
released<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.030> quite<00:00:33.210> short<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.630> I'll

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
released this it's quite short and I'll

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.160 
released this it's quite short and I'll
let<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.020> watch<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> enemy<00:00:37.020> could

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
let you watch that now the enemy could

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.980 
let you watch that now the enemy could
be<00:00:37.320> anywhere<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.430> could<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.610> anyone

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.990 

alright<00:00:45.830> so<00:00:46.010> there<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:46.310> is<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.670> was<00:00:46.790> pretty

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
alright so there it is it was pretty

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.300 
alright so there it is it was pretty
short<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.720> enemy<00:00:48.080> could<00:00:48.260> be<00:00:48.410> anywhere<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.160> it

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
short the enemy could be anywhere and it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.430 
short the enemy could be anywhere and it

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
can see on the screen right now it's bit

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.070 
can see on the screen right now it's bit
blurred<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.790> bit<00:01:04.970> pixelated<00:01:05.510> that's<00:01:05.840> how<00:01:05.960> they

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
blurred a bit pixelated that's how they

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.380 
blurred a bit pixelated that's how they
do<00:01:06.140> it<00:01:06.350> not<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.590> give<00:01:06.740> too<00:01:06.770> much<00:01:07.040> away<00:01:07.220> but<00:01:07.910> that

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
do it not to give too much away but that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.690 
do it not to give too much away but that
main<00:01:08.600> thing<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.830> plane<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.460> screen

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
main thing on the plane on the screen

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.360 
main thing on the plane on the screen
I'm<00:01:10.850> guessing<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.210> some<00:01:11.510> sort<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.950> UAV<00:01:12.950> drone

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
I'm guessing that some sort of UAV drone

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.700 
I'm guessing that some sort of UAV drone
or<00:01:13.790> something<00:01:14.120> like<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.350> could<00:01:15.350> also<00:01:15.530> be

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
or something like that could also be

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.920 
or something like that could also be
maybe<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.160> new<00:01:16.280> stealth<00:01:16.580> bomber<00:01:16.910> just<00:01:17.660> putting

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
maybe a new stealth bomber just putting

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.390 
maybe a new stealth bomber just putting
ideas<00:01:18.050> out<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.070> sort<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.250> looks

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
ideas out there but it sort of looks

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.460 
ideas out there but it sort of looks
like<00:01:19.460> some<00:01:19.700> sort<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.940> drone<00:01:20.240> some<00:01:21.050> spying

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
like some sort of drone some spying

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.170 
like some sort of drone some spying
drone<00:01:21.860> or<00:01:22.010> something<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.729> on<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:23.000> right

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
drone or something and on the right

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.100 
drone or something and on the right
there<00:01:23.420> looks<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:23.780> you've<00:01:23.960> got<00:01:24.050> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
there looks like you've got the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.960 
there looks like you've got the
