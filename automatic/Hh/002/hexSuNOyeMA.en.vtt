00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 here 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.170
 hello everyone with you channel metagame sometimes 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.570
 for victory we need to come up 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.400
 something unusual by doing something from 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.070
 we are not expected at all we can often 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.050
 catch the enemy off guard in this video speech 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.790
 will go about non-standard builds that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.860
 rarely used but it can 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.180
 prove to be very effective and so 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.280
 let's go arquette will give a number of advantages 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.320
 which we do not get from ordinary assemblies 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.940
 the dragon has three active ones 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.949
 spells that he will 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.480
 use often enough while 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.420
 his monopol at the start of the game is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.190
 only 300 400 mana but arquette allows 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.020
 us solve all the problems with mana due 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 increase intelligence and high mana 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.489
 regen and we get 30 plus damage 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.649
 and attack speed which is great help us 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.600
 in battle, besides, we still have 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.460
 one children boom which is paired with the camp 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.890
 make us a formidable force from which not 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.600
 so easy to leave especially arquette will 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 good against heroes with blink or 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.610
 for example, against the game with the storm spirit 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.229
 nek-ry may well be suitable for will enter 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.240
 because they too can fight 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.070
 pharma field on the third level in our 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 there will be two warriors with damage 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.979
 more than a hundred each 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 as well as the ability to burn mana 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.790
 the enemy is also at our disposal 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.799
 true sight appears which, along with 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.110
 chronosphere and will be an unpleasant surprise 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.600
 for and newbies and all this we get for 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.799
 the price is only 5200 gold that even 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 cheaper than mkb 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.880
 or da da luz what's interesting for 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.159
 chronosphere s 3 mini except volts will cause 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.400
 even more damage than himself to b or asked 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.400
 myself 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.229
 in the second dota orb effects became 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 work a little different therefore 2 mail then 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.770
 you can be a good choice and up 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.909
 chance of triggering mail storm of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 perfectly stacks 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.649
 how to troll with his attack speed 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.660
 lightning will fly every second if 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.150
 take into account the average lightning damage there and from 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.610
 each mail storm will receive 54 damage 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.160
 and at 25 attack speeds and in sum it 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.410
 will be plus 108 ron and plus 50 to speed 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.959
 attacks which is quite comparable with the IC 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.910
 or dedal himself but with two mail 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.280
 with our lightning storms we will be able to 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.440
 damaging multiple targets first 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.269
 this will help speed up our farm 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.269
 the second will be quite useful in timfayte 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.620
 bounty hunter all used to collect in 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.450
 as nat damager but dagon 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.890
 fits him no less than say nyx 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.810
 assassin u with a pen we will have 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 the ability to kill the enemy much faster 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 and not chasing him on the debt 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.590
 also bounty hunter with its ulta 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.570
 can quickly earn 5 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.570
 dagon that will allow in seconds 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.190
 cracking down on enemy heroes 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.989
 logical continuation of this build may 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.850
 serve ethereal blade with which even 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.560
 the fattest enemies will die with 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.150
 prokasta 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.709
 this assembly will be effective when 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.239
 enemies in the team are many heroes with 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.070
 small stock hpn and no 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.070
 magic resistance abilities 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.240
 Thought one of those heroes who can quite 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.980
 quickly make money on daguer but for 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.050
 start needing to eat and again 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.480
 centaur to use dagger paris 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.160
 and at us e100 so we will have a great 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.140
 the ability to initiate gangs and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.000
 teamfights breaking in with the camp and immediately 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.910
 hang doom on enemy carry or on 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.680
 hero's most dangerous abilities doom 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.110
 with dagger can work great against 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.090
 heroes like enigma magnus or sand 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.980
 Kinga because he will have a dagger 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.960
 surely faster and he can immediately 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.130
 turn off those heroes from teamfight when 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.960
 Blink's help and my ulta I told 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.880
 tell you about several non-standard options 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.590
 fees that we rarely see in 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.050
 games but they may be 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.030
 very effective and can come up 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.010
 many more unusual combinations of 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.840
 items and abilities of heroes because 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.380
 dota gives us a lot of room 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.720
 for new strategies and tactics 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.720
