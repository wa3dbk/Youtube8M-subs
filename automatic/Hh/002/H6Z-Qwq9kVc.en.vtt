00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hello my beautiful today we are in another 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 video where I'm going to teach 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.100
 eye makeup that I made for the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 I know why I was asked 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.420
 some things besides that is wonderful 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.769
 the pigment is amazing, it was sold to me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.009
 adelita do not know if you have more but it's like 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.739
 chromatic is incredibly beautiful as well 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.570
 that we're going to start the first thing we're going 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 to do is going to be a pre base 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 of eyes I have this fashionable 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.220
 professional academy makeup is a first 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.280
 and I'm going to put it on the whole eyelid 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.510
 this to swim I know and that helps the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 shadows stay in place if 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.300
 we want we will raise it up to the eyebrow 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.850
 and first let's do the basin to 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.449
 that I will occupy a matte brown shadow in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.820
 this case when the browser in in wise and 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.220
 who can find him in the leader and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.010
 I'm going to mark my body 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.610
 and with a shade of vanilla or color 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 skin like that I'm going to light up under 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.240
 the eyebrow 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.270
 now we are going to occupy the liquid metal 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.330
 godson of katrice in color 080 metal 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.100
 080 is this and we will put it with a 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.310
 cat tongue around the eyelid 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 mobile 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 and this is going to be our base for the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.850
 next pigment 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.530
 and then with the same broach that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.350
 We put in the browser basin 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.890
 we go back to blur so that there is no 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.480
 nothing hard and now I 'm going to show you two 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.770
 options with which we can put the 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:04.260
 pigments is the durÃ¡n line endura line 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.230
 of Indian and this color arques there is bad 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.350
 beige there is going to be a base of eyes of 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.260
 that is much cheaper and what can 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.240
 find in bs dietitian so 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.970
 They can occupy the two I will take 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.220
 I'm going to put a droplet in my hand 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.830
 here you can do it also in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.010
 a little dish in which I'm going to occupy the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 hand and I'll put a little with the same 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.300
 think that apply the shadow I'm going to 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 put a bit of facebook on the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.800
 dollar light 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 A) Yes 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 and this causes it to become something a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.860
 little denser and now we're going to 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.860
 little touches putting on the other 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.130
 here girls you have to build 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.130
 building and building 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.110
 It is so beautiful it seems like a fairy tale 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 fairies and now we go to the eyeliner or to the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.850
 what do we do the outline 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.100
 for the delineated I like to occupy 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.819
 this is the track with down this is the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.819
 from craiova 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.500
 and what I did was the one that linked it with the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.569
 part of the bottom and that's why to take a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.180
 pencil eyeliner black and in this case 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.180
 I have the smoky master of maybelline 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.579
 and now we're going to rash the tabs already 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.579
 put a lot of mascara 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.000
 this was the look of the eyes of the video 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 of lifting and I combine it with the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.990
 lip 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.700
 of jordana de los mate that also 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.740
 appeared on the video I think it's the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.020
 option or one of the options that most 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.290
 like above you could apply a gloss 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.270
 or simply leave it I like 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.340
 because the few a super highlighted 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.830
 so I like the mouth to be a 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.600
 little more 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.910
 quiet but you could also occupy it 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.290
 which you want now is very 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270
 fashionable lips can be seen very 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.040
 powerful very powerful eyes so 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.100
 in tastes there is nothing written you 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.860
 you have to feel absolutely comfortable and 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.800
 beautiful so take what you want 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.200
 those beautiful I hope you liked it 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.610
 that the manito up and that a little kiss 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.610
 See you in the next video 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.750
