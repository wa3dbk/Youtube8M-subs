00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to do more in October and when you join

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
to do more in October and when you join
in<00:02:06.540> January<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.140> hard<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.829> back<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
in January it's hard to get back to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820 
in January it's hard to get back to
those<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.929> every<00:02:09.929> year<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.289> important<00:02:10.739> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
those and every year it's important to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
those and every year it's important to
get<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> those<00:02:11.459> things<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.599> think

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
get back to those things and so I think

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.950 
get back to those things and so I think
he's<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.440> looking<00:02:13.650> for

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960

some improvements well I think the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.230 
some improvements well I think the
biggest<00:02:37.660> thing<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.440> focus<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.000> fact

that there's everybody on our team's got
to<00:02:42.640> improve<00:02:43.000> regardless<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.810> how<00:02:44.170> young<00:02:44.560> they

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
to improve regardless of how young they

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
are how old they are and and you know I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.050

think<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.190> attitude<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.940> that

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
think that that attitude and that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.290 
think that that attitude and that
mindset<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.980> critical<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.120> anybody

them that level of competition the bar

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.420 
them that level of competition the bar
raised<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.410> little<00:03:32.650> bit<00:03:32.740> right<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:32.920> obviously

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
raised a little bit right now obviously

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.640 
raised a little bit right now obviously
it's<00:03:33.610> technique<00:03:34.060> work<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.600> more<00:03:34.780> more<00:03:35.290> you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's technique work and more more you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.800 
it's technique work and more more you
know<00:03:35.770> there's<00:03:36.190> not<00:03:36.400> we<00:03:37.150> can't<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.510> get

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
know there's not we can't really get

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.230 
know there's not we can't really get
into<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.200> five<00:03:38.980> on<00:03:39.160> five<00:03:39.460> or<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.880> four<00:03:40.120> on

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
into the five on five or the four on

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.840 
into the five on five or the four on
four<00:03:40.540> stuff<00:03:40.900> or<00:03:41.080> any<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.160> stuff

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
four stuff or any of that so that stuff

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.520 
four stuff or any of that so that stuff
will<00:03:43.000> sort<00:03:43.240> itself<00:03:43.360> out<00:03:43.690> over<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.110> next<00:03:44.350> few

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
will sort itself out over the next few

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.460 
will sort itself out over the next few
weeks<00:03:44.770> once<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.160> start<00:03:45.400> training<00:03:45.760> camp<00:03:46.470> but

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
weeks once we start training camp but

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.960 
weeks once we start training camp but
there's<00:03:47.860> no<00:03:48.040> question<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.490> people<00:03:48.730> are

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
there's no question that people are

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.250 
there's no question that people are
working<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.390> sense<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.720> urgency<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.200> I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
working with a sense of urgency and I

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.710 
working with a sense of urgency and I
think<00:03:50.440> it's<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.770> know<00:03:51.340> it's<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.550> just<00:03:51.720> spots

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
think it's you know it's not just spots

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.560 
think it's you know it's not just spots
it's<00:03:53.020> also<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.800> fact<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.210> lot<00:03:55.540> of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
it's also the fact that we have a lot of

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.020 
it's also the fact that we have a lot of
evenness<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:56.710> use<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.100> word<00:03:57.280> last<00:03:57.580> year<00:03:57.910> as

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
evenness we use that word last year as

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.220 
evenness we use that word last year as
well<00:03:58.210> and<00:03:59.130> you<00:04:00.130> know<00:04:00.250> playing<00:04:00.610> time<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.230> going

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
will be put in a position where you have

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.200 
will be put in a position where you have
to<00:04:11.200> name<00:04:11.950> our<00:04:12.160> starting<00:04:12.580> lineup<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:13.090> our

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
to name our starting lineup in our

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.349 
to name our starting lineup in our

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
rotation and put it down in pencil and

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.270 
rotation and put it down in pencil and
if<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:16.630> go<00:04:16.810> through<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.320> like<00:04:17.739> really<00:04:17.980> go

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
if you go through it like really go

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.620 
if you go through it like really go
through<00:04:18.460> it<00:04:18.640> you<00:04:18.670> put<00:04:19.060> yourself<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.480> my<00:04:19.510> shoes

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
through it you put yourself in my shoes

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.050 
through it you put yourself in my shoes
there's<00:04:20.260> about<00:04:20.410> 150<00:04:20.980> different<00:04:21.280> variations

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
there's about 150 different variations

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.330 
there's about 150 different variations
of<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.630> could<00:04:22.780> go<00:04:22.930> with<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.350> more

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
of this that you could go with and more

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.490 
of this that you could go with and more
so<00:04:24.580> than<00:04:24.730> last<00:04:24.940> year<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.020> thought<00:04:26.260> last

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so than last year and and I thought last

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.480 
so than last year and and I thought last
year<00:04:26.650> we<00:04:26.919> were

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
year we were

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.939 
year we were
pretty<00:04:28.419> hard<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.810> figure<00:04:28.960> out<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:29.530> it's<00:04:29.740> been

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
pretty hard to figure out so it's been

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.550 
pretty hard to figure out so it's been
it's<00:04:30.550> been<00:04:30.639> it's<00:04:31.030> been<00:04:31.569> a<00:04:31.690> fun<00:04:31.990> puzzle<00:04:32.229> to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
it's been it's been a fun puzzle to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.050 
it's been it's been a fun puzzle to
think<00:04:32.800> about<00:04:33.039> but<00:04:33.400> it's<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.639> puzzle<00:04:33.940> that's

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
think about but it's a puzzle that's

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.790 
think about but it's a puzzle that's
going<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.300> figure<00:04:34.599> itself<00:04:34.900> out<00:04:35.139> once<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.560> start

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
going to figure itself out once we start

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.010 
going to figure itself out once we start
practice<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:37.120> everybody<00:04:37.479> healthy<00:04:37.630> going<00:04:37.930> in

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
practice is everybody healthy going in

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.219 
practice is everybody healthy going in
