00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
perfect like the pros but anyway your

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.779 
perfect like the pros but anyway your
foot<00:00:46.469> position<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.460> want<00:00:47.700> your

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
foot position you're gonna want your

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
foot position you're gonna want your
front<00:00:48.090> foot<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:50.780> probably<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.170> would

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
front foot to be probably as you would

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.330 
front foot to be probably as you would
worry<00:00:53.180> probably<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
worry probably where you would as you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.970 
worry probably where you would as you
would<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.879> doing<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.270> burial<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.170> put<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.710> foot

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
would be doing a burial so put your foot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
would be doing a burial so put your foot
your<00:00:59.910> front<00:01:00.239> foot<00:01:01.219> where<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.399> would<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:03.480> if

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
your front foot where you would be if

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.250 
your front foot where you would be if
you're<00:01:04.290> doing<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> variable<00:01:05.189> burial<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.119> put

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
you're doing a variable burial and put

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
you're doing a variable burial and put
your<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.500> foot<00:01:07.860> hanging<00:01:08.610> off<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> edge<00:01:09.299> like

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
your back foot hanging off the edge like

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
your back foot hanging off the edge like
so<00:01:11.299> you're<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:13.049> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so you're gonna want it about right

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.910 
so you're gonna want it about right
there<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.689> hanging<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
there and that hanging up when it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
there and that hanging up when it's
hanging<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> edge<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.259> it<00:01:19.259> gives

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
hanging off the edge like that it gives

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
hanging off the edge like that it gives
you<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> ability<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.369> scoop<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.610> scoop<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you the ability to scoop the to scoop it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
you the ability to scoop the to scoop it
a<00:01:24.240> full<00:01:24.479> 360<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:26.100> Italy

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.700 

and<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:33.310> that's<00:01:33.760> foot<00:01:34.120> placement<00:01:34.690> now<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
and that's that's foot placement now the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.700 
and that's that's foot placement now the
trick<00:01:37.680> basic<00:01:38.680> idea<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.190> trick<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.910> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
trick basic idea this trick is to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.180 
trick basic idea this trick is to
simultaneously<00:01:41.710> scoops<00:01:42.580> straight<00:01:43.180> backwards

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
simultaneously scoops straight backwards

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.610 
simultaneously scoops straight backwards
straight<00:01:45.190> back<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.290> forward<00:01:47.290> at<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.590> same

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
straight back and forward at the same

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.430 
straight back and forward at the same
time<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:48.880> it's<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.690> diagonal

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
time so it's going to be a diagonal

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.610 
time so it's going to be a diagonal
motion<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.820> if<00:01:51.970> if<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.990> don't<00:01:53.170> scrape

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
motion because if if you don't scrape

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.860 
motion because if if you don't scrape
forward<00:01:54.340> enough<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:56.470> will<00:01:56.770> not<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.750> won't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
forward enough you will not you won't

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.740 
forward enough you will not you won't
land<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.380> your<00:01:59.560> board<00:01:59.770> because<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:01.480> board

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
land on your board because the board

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.800 
land on your board because the board
will<00:02:02.290> end<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.650> behind<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:03.430> if<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:04.600> don't

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
will end up behind you if you don't

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.480 
will end up behind you if you don't
scoop<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.470> with<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.160> that's<00:02:06.370> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
scoop it with you so that's the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.070 
scoop it with you so that's the
reasoning<00:02:06.970> behind<00:02:07.030> why<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.600> want<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.900> scoop

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
reasoning behind why you want to scoop

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.110 
reasoning behind why you want to scoop
it<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:10.000> it's<00:02:10.840> simply<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.820> board

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
it for because it's simply the board

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.090 
it for because it's simply the board
will<00:02:13.240> end<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.540> behind<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.200> don't<00:02:14.350> so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
will end up behind you if you don't so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.220 
will end up behind you if you don't so
anyway<00:02:15.550> as<00:02:16.500> as<00:02:17.500> you're<00:02:18.280> scooping<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.390> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
anyway as as you're scooping this in a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.560 
anyway as as you're scooping this in a
diagonal<00:02:20.440> forward<00:02:21.010> motion<00:02:21.340> you're<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
diagonal forward motion you're going to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.290 
diagonal forward motion you're going to
want<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.260> foot<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:24.370> flick<00:02:24.700> straight<00:02:25.090> off<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
want this foot to flick straight off the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.890 
want this foot to flick straight off the
side<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.950> might<00:02:27.160> want<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> conscious

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
side you might want to make a conscious

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.360 
side you might want to make a conscious
effort<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.130> make<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:30.580> forward<00:02:30.910> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
effort to just make it go forward and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.470 
effort to just make it go forward and
make<00:02:33.370> sure<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.700> gets<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.030> whole<00:02:34.150> flick

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
make sure it gets the whole flick

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.240 
make sure it gets the whole flick
because<00:02:34.750> sometimes<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:38.170> difficult<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:39.070> make

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
because sometimes it's difficult to make

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.650 
because sometimes it's difficult to make
sure<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.790> get<00:02:40.020> full<00:02:41.020> kickflip<00:02:41.560> rotation

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
sure that you get full kickflip rotation

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.090 
sure that you get full kickflip rotation
so

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
so

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.450 
so
you're<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> scoop<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.260> scoop<00:02:48.190> as

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
you're going to scoop with this scoop as

foot this foot scrapes off this way me
show<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.440> it's<00:03:40.440> great<00:03:40.620> though<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
show you that so it's great though this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
foot scrapes off this way but the board

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.880 
foot scrapes off this way but the board
is<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.520> be<00:03:47.610> facing<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.270> way<00:03:48.330> as<00:03:48.630> well

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
is going to be facing this way as well

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.670 
is going to be facing this way as well
so<00:03:49.890> what<00:03:50.010> I'm<00:03:50.130> talking<00:03:50.580> about<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:51.680> you're

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
so what I'm talking about is you're

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.310 
so what I'm talking about is you're
going<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:52.890> be<00:03:53.010> scooping<00:03:53.550> right<00:03:53.760> here<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
going to be scooping right here and the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.960 
going to be scooping right here and the
reason<00:03:55.680> why<00:03:55.830> you're<00:03:55.980> scooping<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.400> way<00:03:56.730> is

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
reason why you're scooping that way is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.090 
reason why you're scooping that way is
because<00:03:57.030> your<00:03:57.630> boards<00:03:57.930> already<00:03:58.260> turned<00:03:58.560> like

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
because your boards already turned like

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.390 
because your boards already turned like
that<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.610> that<00:04:00.270> gives<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.050> flick<00:04:01.680> you

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
that and that gives you the flick you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.360 
that and that gives you the flick you
need<00:04:03.470> if<00:04:04.470> you're<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.800> getting<00:04:05.160> enough

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
need if you're not getting enough

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.880 
need if you're not getting enough
flicking<00:04:05.880> your<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.210> trouble<00:04:06.630> try<00:04:07.620> putting

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
flicking your out of trouble try putting

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.520 
flicking your out of trouble try putting
your<00:04:08.010> foot<00:04:08.280> farther<00:04:08.670> into<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.300> board<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.470> that

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
your foot farther into the board so that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.370 
your foot farther into the board so that
you<00:04:11.070> don't<00:04:11.340> flick<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.540> far<00:04:12.840> off<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.230> way<00:04:13.920> and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
you don't flick so far off that way and

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.620 
you don't flick so far off that way and
it<00:04:16.380> should<00:04:16.739> give<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> little<00:04:17.400> more<00:04:17.640> meat<00:04:18.570> to

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it should give you a little more meat to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.980 
it should give you a little more meat to
your<00:04:19.020> kickflip<00:04:20.360> know<00:04:21.360> what<00:04:21.450> I'm<00:04:21.510> saying<00:04:21.810> and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
your kickflip know what I'm saying and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.920 
your kickflip know what I'm saying and
for<00:04:24.990> your<00:04:25.050> back<00:04:25.230> foot<00:04:26.180> your<00:04:27.180> back<00:04:27.330> foot<00:04:27.660> is

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
for your back foot your back foot is

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.010 
for your back foot your back foot is
pretty<00:04:28.230> much<00:04:28.380> doing<00:04:29.150> ninety<00:04:30.150> percent<00:04:30.420> of<00:04:30.780> work

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
pretty much doing ninety percent of work

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.880 
pretty much doing ninety percent of work
with<00:04:31.260> Miss<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:33.270> really<00:04:33.960> important<00:04:34.860> that

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
with Miss and it's really important that

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.030 
with Miss and it's really important that
you<00:04:35.190> practice<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:36.810> trick<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.260> lot<00:04:37.620> because

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
you practice this trick a lot because

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.780 
you practice this trick a lot because
you<00:04:38.220> are<00:04:38.370> not<00:04:38.430> going<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.000> get<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.560> quickly

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
you are not going to get it quickly

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.940 
you are not going to get it quickly
unless

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
unless

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.850 
unless
unless<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:43.850> already<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.630> 360<00:04:45.320> pop<00:04:45.530> shuvit

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
unless you already can 360 pop shuvit

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.760 
unless you already can 360 pop shuvit
really<00:04:46.220> low<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:47.260> kickflip<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.410> all<00:04:48.560> that

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
really low and kickflip and all that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.940 
really low and kickflip and all that
you're<00:04:49.730> probably<00:04:50.030> not<00:04:50.900> going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.260> get<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
you're probably not going to get it the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.570 
you're probably not going to get it the
first<00:04:52.160> day<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.430> see<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.290> anyway<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:55.280> back

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
first day you see it anyway this back

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.390 
first day you see it anyway this back
foot<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.390> scoop<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:57.290> way<00:04:57.560> as<00:04:57.950> hard<00:04:58.220> as<00:04:58.340> you

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
foot you scoop that way as hard as you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.730 
foot you scoop that way as hard as you
can<00:04:58.580> diagonal<00:04:59.330> forward<00:04:59.690> motion<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:03.320> lot<00:05:03.620> of

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
can diagonal forward motion and a lot of

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.950 
can diagonal forward motion and a lot of
problems<00:05:04.100> with<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.340> trick<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:05.690> can<00:05:05.840> only

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
problems with this trick is you can only

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.800 
problems with this trick is you can only
get<00:05:06.140> varial<00:05:06.710> rotation<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:08.120> only<00:05:08.270> get<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.690> to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
get varial rotation you only get it to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.770 
get varial rotation you only get it to
turn<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.050> 180<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:10.930> way<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> fix<00:05:12.290> that<00:05:12.560> is<00:05:12.800> as

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
turn on 180 and way to fix that is as

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.750 
turn on 180 and way to fix that is as
you're<00:05:14.780> flicking<00:05:15.050> off<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:16.100> really<00:05:16.280> helps<00:05:16.670> if

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
you're flicking off it really helps if

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.900 
you're flicking off it really helps if
you<00:05:16.880> sort<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.240> lean<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:18.230> way<00:05:18.400> if<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.550> sort<00:05:19.790> of

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
you sort of lean that way if you sort of

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.380 
you sort of lean that way if you sort of
lean<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.650> then<00:05:21.650> make<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.400> conscious<00:05:22.760> effort<00:05:23.120> to

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
lean and then make a conscious effort to

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.340 
lean and then make a conscious effort to
flick<00:05:23.870> it<00:05:24.400> as<00:05:25.400> hard<00:05:25.730> as<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.450> sort<00:05:27.200> of

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
flick it as hard as you can sort of

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.850 
flick it as hard as you can sort of
straight<00:05:27.650> back<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.280> forth<00:05:28.700> it's<00:05:29.110> um<00:05:30.110> you'll

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
straight back and forth it's um you'll

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.140 
straight back and forth it's um you'll
understand<00:05:31.310> what<00:05:31.430> I'm<00:05:31.550> talking<00:05:31.910> about<00:05:31.970> when

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.170 
understand what I'm talking about when
you<00:05:32.390> start<00:05:32.660> practicing<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:34.910> is<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
you start practicing but that is the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.720 
you start practicing but that is the
most<00:05:35.450> important<00:05:36.020> part<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:38.500> scraping<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:40.460> way

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
most important part is scraping that way

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.260 
most important part is scraping that way
as<00:05:41.540> hard<00:05:41.810> as<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.050> can<00:05:42.280> see<00:05:43.280> unlike<00:05:43.670> a<00:05:43.730> burial
