Gather up a bunch of wooden spoons and some
unexpected materials from your kitchen and

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.090
you and your kids can create a family of puppets
to play with.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.350
For this craft, you'll need assorted wooden
spoons, office dot stickers, scissors, hot

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.560
glue, tape, cupcake liners, a sponge, a mesh
[ unk ] bag, wax paper, a 3 inch piece of

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.360
paper dot candy and a cardboard box label.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.820
First, we're gonna give this guy a bow tie
and a hat.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.130
We've cut a hat- shaped from a kitchen sponge
and a bow tie shape and we're gonna use scissors

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.450
just to cut a little opening in the hat and
an opening in a bow tie.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.950
And we're gonna slide on bow tie and slide
on his hat.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.730
From a nutrition label, we've cut 2 slits
one a the top and one at the bottom and slide

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.800
that on, that will be his tuxedo and from
2 cupcake liners we're going to make a vest.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.760
Just flatten up the cupcake liner, place it
underneath and just add a little hot glue

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.830
and glues up his vest.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.600
To make his eyes, please 2 white office stickers
on his face and we're gonna give him blue

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.400
eyes 2 smaller office dots and 1 red dot for
his mouth and lastly, we're going to cut him

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.220
some eyebrows trace green office dot stickers
and it is all done.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.340
To make the spoon lady's skirt, we need about
24 inch strip of wax paper, you fold it over,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.479
not quite halfway and you've do an accordion
folds about 1 inch apart.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.000
You can sit that aside and we're going to
create a collar, a multi- layers of cupcake

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
liners and we can just stack them alternating
and this will be his skirt.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.480
We'll cut these all together at one time.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.780
Put the one you've designated first skirt
aside.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, slide on the cupcake liners for the collar
and lastly for her skirt, use 2 white enforcement

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.859
stickers in her eyes and some smaller office
dot stickers.

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:21.810
You can use these larger office dot stickers
to create the mouth and the small silver cupcake

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.629
liner for her hat.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.659
Attach it to the spoon using small office
dot stickers.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.659
To create this cute candy girl, we're using
dot candy.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.940
Just remove the two dots here and then cut
a slit at the top and a slit at the bottom.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.319
This is about 3 inch piece.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.819
Slide it on to create this cute little polka-
dotted shirt.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.889
For her hair, we've taken a piece of the mesh
[ unk ] bag, tying a knot in the center and

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.200
just a little dab of hot glue at the top.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.939
Attach her hair, while that [ unk ] you can
make a skirt, usually one cup cake liner.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.709
Got a whole in the bottom, slide it on, create
a little skirt.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.349
To make her face, follow the same step using
the office dot stickers.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.110
There are so many fun possibilities for these
spoon puppets if you and your kids take the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.259
time to look in your pantry or around your
house for some exciting *** CUT DICTATION
