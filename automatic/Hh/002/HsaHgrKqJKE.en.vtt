a spirit and if it dies the spirit
haunts<00:00:13.110> another<00:00:13.349> victim<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.920> that's<00:00:14.400> true

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
haunts another victim and that's true

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.070 
haunts another victim and that's true
but<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.179> doesn't<00:00:15.420> really<00:00:15.540> explain<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:15.990> it

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
but it doesn't really explain what it

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
but it doesn't really explain what it
does<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.440> haunt<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.890> ADOT<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> does<00:00:17.970> damage

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.200 
does so haunt is ADOT it does damage
over<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.550> monster<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.699> question

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
over time on the monster in question

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.599 
over time on the monster in question
that<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.449> haunted<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.439> cannot<00:00:23.220> stack

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that you have haunted you cannot stack

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
that you have haunted you cannot stack
it<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.090> once<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.570> placed<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.320> enemy<00:00:25.800> there

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it so once it's placed on a enemy there

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.120 
it so once it's placed on a enemy there
is<00:00:26.070> no<00:00:26.189> point<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:27.529> continuously<00:00:28.529> cast<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
is no point in continuously cast in it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.919 
is no point in continuously cast in it
but<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.359> stays<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.779> the

creature dives so when skill will go a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
creature dives so when skill will go a
long<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:37.040> as<00:00:38.040> far<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.410> rooms<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> are

tide so if you cast haunt on half the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 
tide so if you cast haunt on half the
party<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> use<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.340> AoE<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> kill<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
remainder that will be a lot better on

00:01:47.759 --> 00:02:04.450 
remainder that will be a lot better on
your<00:01:48.119> mana<00:01:48.479> reserve

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.210 

font<00:02:05.460> lasts<00:02:05.850> quite<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> long<00:02:06.480> time<00:02:06.890> so<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.980> do
