00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.000
 How much can I lose to make me forgive? 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.130
 How much pain does it take to meet you again? 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.610
 One more time, do not change 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.960
 One more time, back to the time when you are playing with you. 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.370
 I always admit defeat when quarreling 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.490
 But your wayward makes me more obsessed 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.060
 One more chance I am imprisoned by memory 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.560
 One more chance has been unable to choose the next destination 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.880
 I am always looking for you. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.580
 Opposite the window in the room alley 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.220
 Although I know that you are not there 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.590
 If the wish can be realized, I have to come to you right away. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.280
 No longer afraid of anything 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.790
 Even if you give everything, you will hold you tight 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.790
 Anyone who can only solve loneliness can replace 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.020
 But on this starry night, I canâ€™t deceive myself. 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.350
 One more time, do not change 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.680
 One more time, back to the time when you are playing with you. 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.180
 I am always looking for you. 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.770
 Bustling street dreams 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 Although I know that you are not there 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.850
 If a miracle can happen, I want to see you right away. 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.450
 Discard all past in a new morning 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.700
 Say the long-awaited "I love you" 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.880
 Summer memories linger in my heart 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.740
 Think of the heartbeat that has disappeared unintentionally 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.310
 I am always looking for you. 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.910
 Small town in the streets of dawn 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.600
 Although I know that you are not there 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 If the wish can be realized, I have to come to you right away. 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.600
 No longer afraid of anything 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.300
 Even if you give everything, you will hold you tight 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.550
 I am always looking for your voice. 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.150
 The corner of the hotel newspaper that departs 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.700
 Although I know that you are not there 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.090
 If a miracle can happen, I want to see you right away. 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.650
 Discard all past in a new morning 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.340
 Say the long-awaited "I love you" 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.740
 I am always looking for your smile. 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.340
 Galloping on both sides of the train railway 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.000
 Although I know that you are not there 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.350
 If life can be reincarnation, it will accompany you no matter how many times. 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.260
 Nothing can make me nostalgic 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.320
 As long as I have you, I have nothing to ask for.
