00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.310
 this tremendous mobilization does not stop in France that makes 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.660
 already for a moment that the delegated radiation exceeds all 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.129
 boundary 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.359
 and percent and decided it to accelerate precisely this 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.199
 european development bourgoin in a report that thierry bassi 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.609
 June 16, 2009 zinedine zidane plants at 4810 meters altitude on the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.210
 Mont Blanc 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.890
 the flag of lilacs 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 a performance and an application of a very great champion 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.189
 which is not followed 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.410
 you also have for example in madrid 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.640
 the iconic player komorowski and by nbc in spain 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.780
 we must not forget that the sum is present 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.470
 but also country today I think that's Europe by inviting 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 galactic of the real madrid zinedane zidane it does not lack ambition 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.350
 the iconic tarradellas 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.420
 francis a new course in the fight against the disease 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 for this madrid real we will be able to be strengthened our presence in 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.430
 Spain already 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 and then go far beyond bringing other countries together 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.710
 for us it's very important because we have to gather all 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.170
 families on the one hand and then gather our financial means to 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 take the next steps in medical research 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.940
 and the military coup 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.430
 like rugby 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.329
 today 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.470
 six nations 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.480
 spain 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.500
 Switzerland but also Italy Belgium Luxembourg 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.690
 and France 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.230
 to transform the test 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.250
 and are already preparing it to set up a systematic screening of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.370
 leukodystrophies 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 at birth 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.649
 here is where are the images of this sum she even said 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.520
 good for football that you know well that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.460
 the bernabeu cable manufacturer where here but the mont blanc list was not 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.320
 so easy anyway 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.960
 but it's a great experience 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.950
 it was a great experience to excel because we had 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.260
 often 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.440
 to go beyond for the children for the circumference all the families 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.009
 and that's what I was able to do at that time because it's true that 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.009
 it was not easy even though I might have been physically prepared 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 it was not easy because the attitude still 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.409
 difficult 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 to restart it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.170
 he was a great sportsman who did not get to the top because 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.439
 it is 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.469
 it is very difficult and very bad of the mountains that is made 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.189
 you do not quite see exactly that's what's what 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.879
 happened next by the end 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.859
 the last 300 meters were they 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.859
 been difficult because it's true I'm starting to have a headache and 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.629
 but percent but here I do it I do it for years to go elsewhere 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
 to plant this flag under the flag of the 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.289
 all on the rooftop of europe 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.489
 score a goal 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.620
 thanks to the initiative of christian jean-pierre the sweat 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.069
 finally I proceeded terribly 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.119
 I do not think it's all invented, that's all that, even if it's me 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.649
 went to see him oil 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.149
 any time 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:00.319
 that was the same Corday language that started from the wood and that ended the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.669
 case ended at the axes this flag of this goal scored he is peeling 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.679
 fabric stays at base camp 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.679
 it's been a decade now it's just this 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.599
 meet 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.439
 and that really everywhere 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.919
 in the media it's everywhere now we know 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.599
 the fact that the association 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 and what do you remember from his friends 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.499
 what I remember is that 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.429
 you know maybe it's craze that there's just comeback from the 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:28.539
 pause that 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.329
 and that's what's really important for all families who fall back 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.599
 industry in trouble estimated yesterday that 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.599
 when i see what jessica is still here today because that makes 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.829
 I spent a lot of time with the godmother who are there since very 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.829
 long before I may be the one with whom 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.849
 and maybe the most beautiful the most the word because 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.399
 small by segment the most known but I think what's important is that 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.239
 to see all the people who according to always been present around the queen who 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.199
 Talk about 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.039
 like bella 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.839
 like their families in celebration what is it 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.539
 according to her the real subject and the laces that 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.059
 it's for all the people who surround the 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.739
 it's like a second family 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.879
 and for 100 th a second family so that means that 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.900
 for me the word c is the fidelity girl 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.090
 so in a family 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.370
 a spokesperson 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.759
 a mother 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.539
 it's sophie thalmann passed a little near 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.840
 at the moment the sign of a started commitment 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.580
 that yourself 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.189
 you ended up theirs a bit by chance that the grounds of 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.210
 football and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.979
 for three years for the telefoot broadcast 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.960
 it was huge 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.160
 in october 98 you asked me about the costs of sending a 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.569
 standard match 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.840
 and for that day I learned that 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.830
 the stylus 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.650
 do it next to a little boy 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.840
 jérémy 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680
 having done I learned that he had leukodystrophy if I 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.729
 did not know this disease 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.259
 and the pinnacle in the morning to marmande let go of his helmet 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.490
 she's starting to have a balanced loss look for 104 well having 

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:05.689
 see idyllic distinguish the ears because his desires 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.129
 laughed and laughed after the mom explained to me the disease 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.400
 and for those who go there it was the beginning of a great adventure 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.550
 they do not know what it is often like that Morocco 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.880
 but people do not know the case even the name of the disease after 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.599
 blows one must discover around them 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.250
 and me that it has me a lot 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.250
 touched and it has marked me today today these German actions of which 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.860
 cuche 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.460
 I still see the association the difference that she has a lot of 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.770
 character and thierry but it was it was not 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.110
 and unfortunately shortly after we left 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.569
 it's decisive 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.110
 really get mobilized and make known and there 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.589
 it is true that he is still two years old but it is worse than today 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.069
 so I'm glad to see that I'm not telling you at night 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.139
 the children are now all the families and by what hope 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.819
 especially I think it's so the insistence is why not for nothing 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.839
 what wonderful what 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.110
 compared to 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.169
 he incurs twelve years a group 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.210
 so I was born there somewhere we experienced a rise that all those 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.520
 we talked about earlier 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.030
 second part 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.340
 so today it's not like we said a step and time in 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.600
 time a very beautiful new lights that come on in the room 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.619
 like that 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.619
 and then the sun the player will eventually get by 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.879
 beautiful images 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.490
 yes we live empty 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.270
 it must be said that the parents for what I am 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.999
 the cheapest one parent among others 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.059
 the next turn 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.059
 thanks to this news for 30 hours on the set 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.279
 and then and thanks to this melee to this chore the sophie who is one 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.270
 the first godmother of the association 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.499
 for some time who speaks today 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:49.219
 percent thanks to all the godparents who are in the room because 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.110
 that there are many who have joined us 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.539
 some have so many others recently 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.940
 and he knows that in the face of his function the saying this one did not have this melee and 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:58.840
 it's old fashioned 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.190
 that force for us for us to push us forward 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.520
 I think it would be a long time since we would have locked the door but 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.060
 luckily we have this chance to continue fighting a lot and it's true 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.939
 that the evening includes three houses finally I think especially 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.149
 for all families the association me too when we go home 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.839
 at least two other kids mine the chance to grow up till then he's fine 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.449
 percent but I know this is not the case unfortunately for most 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.430
 families well 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.389
 I can tell you that but a sacred is both a little moral blow is 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.780
 a sacred page to continue to fight again and continue it's 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.270
 what we are doing here today but we are all the more beautiful life as 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.169
 as the title of this soap opera that has been well presented here in the room 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.069
 by a large number of comedian deaths
