all of the above beautifully although a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920 
all of the above beautifully although a
friend<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> mine<00:00:50.940> used<00:00:51.239> hers<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.719> freeze

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
so don't do that I store my food cubes

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069

ingredients and date on the front

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
ingredients and date on the front
because<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> trays<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.870> made<00:01:01.020> with

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
because the trays are made with

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.439 
because the trays are made with
non-toxic<00:01:01.739> ingredients<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> plastic<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> not

non-toxic ingredients the plastic is not

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
non-toxic ingredients the plastic is not
bendy<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> bend<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bendy so you don't want to bend the

bendy so you don't want to bend the
trays<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.210> food<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.650> instead<00:01:07.650> just

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
trays to get your food out instead just

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
trays to get your food out instead just
push<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.970> side<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.390> each<00:01:09.510> tray<00:01:09.869> and

push down on one side of each tray and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
push down on one side of each tray and
it<00:01:10.200> should<00:01:10.409> swivel<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> bit

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it should swivel right out if it's a bit

some water for a few seconds and then

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620 
some water for a few seconds and then
your<00:01:16.140> cubes<00:01:16.439> will<00:01:16.680> easily<00:01:17.189> come<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:18.420> serve
