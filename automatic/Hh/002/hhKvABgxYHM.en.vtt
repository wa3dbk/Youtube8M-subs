okay<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.010> just<00:00:02.070> want<00:00:02.370> to

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay in this video I just want to

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay in this video I just want to
discuss<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.000> peptide<00:00:03.360> bond<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.780> little<00:00:03.870> bit

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
discuss the peptide bond a little bit

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.499 
discuss the peptide bond a little bit
before<00:00:04.259> we<00:00:04.440> start<00:00:04.770> drawing<00:00:05.390> you<00:00:06.390> know

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
before we start drawing you know

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.249 
before we start drawing you know
tripeptides

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
tripeptides

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.660 
tripeptides
tetra<00:00:08.040> peptides<00:00:08.490> etc<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.620> peptide<00:00:11.040> bond<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
tetra peptides etc so a peptide bond is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
tetra peptides etc so a peptide bond is
also<00:00:12.179> known<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.540> an<00:00:12.660> AB<00:00:12.809> made<00:00:12.990> bond<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
also known as an AB made bond it is a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.160 
also known as an AB made bond it is a
covalent<00:00:14.460> chemical<00:00:14.910> bond<00:00:15.240> formed<00:00:16.109> between

definition<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.320> took<00:00:34.500> from<00:00:34.649> Wikipedia<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:36.649> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
definition I took from Wikipedia and to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.200 
definition I took from Wikipedia and to
go<00:00:37.770> along<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.460> wanted<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> show

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
go along with it I just wanted to show

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
go along with it I just wanted to show
the<00:00:39.390> formation<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:40.020> amide<00:00:40.320> bond<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the formation of an amide bond so a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.119 
the formation of an amide bond so a
little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> organic<00:00:41.820> chemistry<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:44.360> so

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
little bit of organic chemistry here so

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit of organic chemistry here so
I'm<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> draw<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:50.989> stuff<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'm just going to draw some stuff here

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
I'm just going to draw some stuff here
and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.250> I'll<00:00:53.640> show<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.390> thinking

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and then I'll show you what I'm thinking

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:03.520 
and then I'll show you what I'm thinking
about<00:00:54.870> doing<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> first<00:01:02.309> I'll<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.579> draw<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
about doing so first I'll just draw a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.630 
about doing so first I'll just draw a
carboxylic<00:01:04.530> acid<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.780> an<00:01:06.780> amine<00:01:06.900> group<00:01:07.640> now

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
carboxylic acid and an amine group now

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
carboxylic acid and an amine group now
the<00:01:09.420> thing<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:10.080> might<00:01:10.229> remember<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:11.010> organic

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the thing we might remember from organic

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
the thing we might remember from organic
chemistry<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.570> Delta<00:01:13.140> positive

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
chemistry is that this is Delta positive

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.140 
chemistry is that this is Delta positive
and<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> Delta<00:01:14.790> negative<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:17.729> has

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and this is Delta negative and this has

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
and this is Delta negative and this has
a<00:01:18.180> lone<00:01:18.420> pair<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> electrons<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.799> can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a lone pair of electrons so what can

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.990 
a lone pair of electrons so what can
happen<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.159> attack<00:01:23.869> right<00:01:24.869> here

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
happen here is we can attack right here

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
happen here is we can attack right here
and<00:01:27.000> kick<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.350> arrow<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.799> like

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and kick that up with an arrow up like

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.600 
and kick that up with an arrow up like
that<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:33.049> what<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.200> wind<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that and what we wind up with is a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.450 
that and what we wind up with is a
pretty<00:01:36.240> high<00:01:36.509> energy<00:01:37.460> tetrahedral

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pretty high energy tetrahedral

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
pretty high energy tetrahedral
intermediate<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> show<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
intermediate so I'm going to show that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
intermediate so I'm going to show that
negative<00:01:43.799> charge<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> oxygen<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:45.060> here

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
negative charge on the oxygen up here

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
negative charge on the oxygen up here
and<00:01:46.220> then<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.700> n<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:50.399> R<00:01:50.579> group<00:01:50.810> H<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and then we have n the R group H and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.359 
and then we have n the R group H and
another<00:01:53.610> H<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> positive<00:01:55.890> charge

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
another H and this is a positive charge

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.120 
another H and this is a positive charge
on<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
on it so I don't know if you can see it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.319 
on it so I don't know if you can see it
too<00:01:59.250> well<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> positive<00:01:59.939> charge

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
too well but that's a positive charge

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.560 
too well but that's a positive charge
now<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.560> thing<00:02:02.009> about<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.030> yes

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
now the thing about this is that yes

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
now the thing about this is that yes
this<00:02:03.990> group<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> much<00:02:05.070> better<00:02:05.219> leaving

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
this group is a much better leaving

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.969 
this group is a much better leaving
group<00:02:05.759> than<00:02:06.409> do<00:02:07.409> h<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.619> does<00:02:10.770> happen

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
group than do h but and it does happen

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.670 
group than do h but and it does happen
that<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> group<00:02:11.670> does<00:02:12.060> come<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.110> leave

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that that group does come on and leave

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.100 
that that group does come on and leave
Sam<00:02:14.250> mean<00:02:14.459> group<00:02:14.700> does<00:02:14.939> come<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.659> leave<00:02:15.840> at

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Sam mean group does come on and leave at

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.589 
Sam mean group does come on and leave at
you<00:02:16.409> know<00:02:16.530> various<00:02:16.829> signs<00:02:17.129> but<00:02:18.000> every<00:02:18.329> once<00:02:18.510> in

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
you know various signs but every once in

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.770 
you know various signs but every once in
a<00:02:18.659> while<00:02:18.689> something<00:02:18.959> else<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.439> happen<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
a while something else can happen and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
a while something else can happen and
what<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.989> basically<00:02:22.170> happen<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.189> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
what can basically happen here is that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.270 
what can basically happen here is that
this<00:02:24.030> negative<00:02:24.780> charge<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.409> kick<00:02:25.650> back

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
this negative charge here we kick back

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.940 
this negative charge here we kick back
down<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.099> kick<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.549> off<00:02:30.950> because

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
down and we can kick this off because

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.280 
down and we can kick this off because
really<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.150> tetrahedral<00:02:33.780> intermediate<00:02:34.230> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
really this tetrahedral intermediate is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.899 
really this tetrahedral intermediate is
a<00:02:34.319> very<00:02:34.650> very<00:02:34.890> high<00:02:35.069> energy<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
a very very high energy because of the

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.369 
a very very high energy because of the
charges<00:02:36.209> especially<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> negative<00:02:37.019> charge

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
charges especially the negative charge

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.869 
charges especially the negative charge
on<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> oxygen<00:02:39.079> so<00:02:40.079> what<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.220> wind<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.640> with

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
on the oxygen so what we wind up with

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.910 
on the oxygen so what we wind up with
here<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> I'll<00:02:44.670> go<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.030> way<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.659> is

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.210 

Reformation<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.220> carbonyl<00:02:50.670> groove<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:05.539 

this<00:02:58.579> here<00:02:59.870> plus<00:03:00.870> o<00:03:01.139> h<00:03:01.590> minus<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:05.099> really

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
this here plus o h minus and to really

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.069 
this here plus o h minus and to really
finish<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.939> off<00:03:06.120> though<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.689> last<00:03:06.870> thing

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
finish this off though the last thing

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.750 
finish this off though the last thing
that<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.319> happen<00:03:07.439> is<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:08.069> o<00:03:08.220> h<00:03:08.430> here

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that will happen is that this o h here

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.710 
that will happen is that this o h here
will<00:03:09.120> take<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.540> proton<00:03:10.019> from<00:03:10.549> here<00:03:11.549> kick<00:03:12.510> back

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
will take a proton from here kick back

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.470 
will take a proton from here kick back
on<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.079> there<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.920> we'll<00:03:16.920> move<00:03:17.129> over<00:03:17.370> here

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.810 

we'll<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.720> wind<00:03:21.989> up<00:03:22.459> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.579> Ameen

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.920 

that's<00:03:29.820> on<00:03:30.150> charge<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.970> that's<00:03:32.970> basically

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
that's on charge now so that's basically

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.890 
that's on charge now so that's basically
the<00:03:34.440> general<00:03:34.860> mechanism<00:03:35.430> for<00:03:35.940> how<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.150> form

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the general mechanism for how to form

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.460 
the general mechanism for how to form
this<00:03:37.080> bond<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.740> very<00:03:37.920> basic<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:39.470> now

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
this bond of a very basic one and now

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.870 
this bond of a very basic one and now
that<00:03:40.590> we<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.950> understand<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.550> little<00:03:41.760> bit

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
that we kind of understand a little bit

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.420 
that we kind of understand a little bit
about<00:03:42.090> what's<00:03:42.330> going<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.780> with<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.430> peptide

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
about what's going on with the peptide

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.660 
about what's going on with the peptide
bond<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.720> here<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.800> problem<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.520> says

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
bond I have here a problem that says

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.740 
bond I have here a problem that says
draw<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.490> problem<00:03:50.820> here<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:50.970> says<00:03:51.270> draw<00:03:51.510> up

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
draw of a problem here that says draw up

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.600 
draw of a problem here that says draw up
a<00:03:51.930> tetrapeptide<00:03:52.730> tyrosine<00:03:53.730> as<00:03:54.180> far<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.690> gene

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
a tetrapeptide tyrosine as far and gene

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.180 
a tetrapeptide tyrosine as far and gene
leucine<00:03:56.610> methionine<00:03:57.510> at<00:03:57.750> physiological<00:03:58.470> pH

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
leucine methionine at physiological pH

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.330 
leucine methionine at physiological pH
so<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.720> might<00:04:00.900> recall<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.340> physiological

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
so you might recall that physiological

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.110 
so you might recall that physiological
pH<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:03.000> equal<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> seven<00:04:03.900> point<00:04:04.140> four<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.940> again

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
pH is equal to seven point four so again

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.580 
pH is equal to seven point four so again
this<00:04:06.270> is<00:04:06.420> where<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.660> might<00:04:06.810> help<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> have

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
this is where it might help you to have

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.950 
this is where it might help you to have
the<00:04:08.310> chart<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:08.880> front<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.720> show<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
the chart in front of you to show you

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.750 
the chart in front of you to show you
what's<00:04:10.200> going<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.710> see<00:04:10.950> what<00:04:11.160> charge<00:04:11.490> and

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
what's going on and see what charge and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.960 
what's going on and see what charge and
what's<00:04:11.910> not<00:04:12.030> charged<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:14.430> next<00:04:14.700> thing<00:04:14.850> to

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
what's not charged and the next thing to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.380 
what's not charged and the next thing to
do<00:04:15.120> here<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:16.020> start<00:04:16.200> drawing<00:04:16.500> out<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
do here is just start drawing out the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:24.010 
do here is just start drawing out the
peptide<00:04:19.670> so<00:04:20.670> we<00:04:21.270> have<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.810> amine<00:04:22.410> group<00:04:22.680> here

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
peptide so we have the amine group here

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.290 
peptide so we have the amine group here
again<00:04:25.020> just<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.410> backbone<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
again just the backbone and this is the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.790 
again just the backbone and this is the
alpha<00:04:27.630> carbon<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:29.040> I'll<00:04:29.550> draw<00:04:29.910> my<00:04:29.940> tyrosine

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
alpha carbon so I'll draw my tyrosine

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.310 
alpha carbon so I'll draw my tyrosine
ch2<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:34.940> if<00:04:35.940> we<00:04:36.210> recall<00:04:36.510> from<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.810> last<00:04:37.020> video

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
ch2 and if we recall from the last video

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.210 
ch2 and if we recall from the last video
or<00:04:37.860> maybe<00:04:38.280> not<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:39.360> tyrosine<00:04:40.170> sidechain<00:04:40.800> has

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
or maybe not that tyrosine sidechain has

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.720 
or maybe not that tyrosine sidechain has
a<00:04:41.250> pKa<00:04:41.730> of<00:04:41.820> 10.5<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:43.350> since<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:44.010> pH<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.640> equal

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
a pKa of 10.5 so since this pH is equal

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.190 
a pKa of 10.5 so since this pH is equal
to<00:04:44.910> seven<00:04:45.270> point<00:04:45.480> four<00:04:45.630> it's<00:04:45.780> going<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.080> be

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
to seven point four it's going to be

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.690 
to seven point four it's going to be
protonated<00:04:47.570> now<00:04:49.010> we'll<00:04:50.010> get<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> carbonyl

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
protonated now we'll get the carbonyl

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.780 
protonated now we'll get the carbonyl
group<00:04:50.730> here<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.650> that's<00:04:52.650> where<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.190> amid

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
group here and that's where the amid

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.330 
group here and that's where the amid
bond<00:04:54.570> or<00:04:55.020> peptide<00:04:55.620> bond<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.010> formed<00:04:56.370> NH<00:04:57.920> so<00:04:58.920> we

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
bond or peptide bond is formed NH so we

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.770 
bond or peptide bond is formed NH so we
draw<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.640> next<00:05:01.130> side<00:05:02.130> chain<00:05:02.430> which<00:05:02.700> is

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
draw the next side chain which is

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.210 
draw the next side chain which is
sparging<00:05:04.640> ch2<00:05:05.640> C<00:05:06.300> double<00:05:07.170> bond<00:05:07.350> o<00:05:08.600> NH<00:05:09.600> two

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
sparging ch2 C double bond o NH two

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.340 
sparging ch2 C double bond o NH two
there's<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.490> side<00:05:11.760> chain<00:05:13.640> now<00:05:14.640> again<00:05:15.350> same

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
there's that side chain now again same

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.120 
there's that side chain now again same
thing

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
thing

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.230 
thing
form<00:05:19.130> another<00:05:19.840> at<00:05:20.840> mid<00:05:21.140> bond<00:05:21.410> here<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:23.030> we'll

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
form another at mid bond here and we'll

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:34.710 
form another at mid bond here and we'll
draw<00:05:23.450> a<00:05:23.480> leucine<00:05:24.050> which<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:25.580> CH<00:05:25.940> 2<00:05:26.360> CH<00:05:30.250> ch3<00:05:32.260> ch3

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
draw a leucine which is CH 2 CH ch3 ch3

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.930 
draw a leucine which is CH 2 CH ch3 ch3
so<00:05:35.720> there's<00:05:35.930> leucine<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:39.070> again<00:05:42.940> we'll

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
so there's leucine and now again we'll

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.730 
so there's leucine and now again we'll
draw<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.950> same<00:05:45.950> H<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:48.230> last<00:05:48.410> one<00:05:48.590> so

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
draw this same H and the last one so

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.150 
draw this same H and the last one so
thigh<00:05:48.920> a<00:05:48.950> name<00:05:49.070> which<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.550> CH<00:05:49.850> 2<00:05:50.210> CH<00:05:50.510> 2<00:05:51.970> s<00:05:53.770> CH<00:05:54.770> 3

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
thigh a name which is CH 2 CH 2 s CH 3

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.530 
thigh a name which is CH 2 CH 2 s CH 3
and<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.100> end<00:05:58.280> here<00:05:58.550> we'll<00:05:58.820> have<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.000> carbon

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
and on the end here we'll have a carbon

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.070 
and on the end here we'll have a carbon
double<00:05:59.960> bond<00:06:00.140> o<00:06:00.350> o<00:06:02.470> -<00:06:04.720> so<00:06:05.720> that's<00:06:05.930> your

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
double bond o o - so that's your

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.990 
double bond o o - so that's your
tetrapeptide<00:06:06.530> right<00:06:07.370> there<00:06:09.850> nothing<00:06:10.850> really

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
tetrapeptide right there nothing really

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.030 
tetrapeptide right there nothing really
spectacular<00:06:11.360> just<00:06:11.990> recognizing<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:12.830> this

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
spectacular just recognizing that this

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.810 
spectacular just recognizing that this
is<00:06:13.250> your<00:06:14.150> peptide<00:06:15.110> bond<00:06:15.350> and<00:06:15.770> that<00:06:16.700> the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
is your peptide bond and that the

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.470 
is your peptide bond and that the
backbones<00:06:17.210> are<00:06:17.810> all<00:06:18.620> in<00:06:18.830> place<00:06:19.070> and<00:06:19.480> another

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
backbones are all in place and another

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.850 
backbones are all in place and another
thing<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:20.780> recognize<00:06:20.900> is<00:06:21.290> that<00:06:21.320> goes<00:06:21.590> from<00:06:21.710> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
thing to recognize is that goes from the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.260 
thing to recognize is that goes from the
end<00:06:21.890> terminus<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.300> C<00:06:23.450> terminus<00:06:24.010> and

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
end terminus to the C terminus and

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.160 
end terminus to the C terminus and
that's<00:06:26.270> about<00:06:26.390> all<00:06:26.540> I<00:06:26.690> wanted<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:26.990> say<00:06:27.110> for

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
that's about all I wanted to say for

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.620 
that's about all I wanted to say for
this<00:06:27.380> video
