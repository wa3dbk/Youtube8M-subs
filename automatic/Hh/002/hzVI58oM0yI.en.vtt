I'm the champion but you know I think
the<00:02:04.850> champion<00:02:05.270> should<00:02:05.389> always<00:02:05.509> get<00:02:05.749> to<00:02:05.869> know

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
the champion should always get to know

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.160 
the champion should always get to know
the<00:02:06.530> nudge<00:02:07.300> except<00:02:08.300> if<00:02:08.600> you're<00:02:08.780> fighting<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
the nudge except if you're fighting a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.999 
the nudge except if you're fighting a
legend<00:02:09.560> yeah

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
legend yeah

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
legend yeah
so<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.519> mean<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.269> probably<00:02:12.540> stinker<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.069 
so I mean I was probably stinker of a
fight<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.620> stuff<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.659> it<00:02:15.659> was<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.870> huge

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
fight and stuff but it was a huge

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.960
