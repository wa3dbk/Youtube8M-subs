00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.250

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 extremely warm weather for this government 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 at least and the fact that I mean mine 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.720
 I had to take off my coat and my shoes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.119

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 I've already thrown a lot 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.340

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.070
 I like it very much 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.470
 for years and yes I have 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.650
 m 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.510
 but that's an old size so that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.939
 are still these beautiful big bags 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.280
 was shopping and these bags 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.189
 somehow perfectly suited for 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 shopping or a lot of stuff 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:34.229
 I took it with me and then I carried it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.930

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.799
 Apparel and I have a little bit 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 I rolled up and I wear mine 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:52.770
 band lavish logos in size 35 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.920
 I have from deluxe last summer 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.049
 I think summer autumn and that were 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.130
 the only one who has the course 35 in 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.350
 all sorts of online shops and also 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.429
 here in the shops asked and there was 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.299
 just no 35 because the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.950
 big bigger and that has me the 36 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.189
 been too big 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.560
 and yes they had a 35 and me 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.200
 I am very satisfied and yes you see 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.719
 So I have the trousers carded up 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.299
 and no socks on and now leather jacket 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:32.459
 and no scarf and it is me 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:35.469
 not too cold and I'm a right one 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.920
 frostbite i'll show you that i 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.840
 worn underneath it though not 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.549
 becomes more spectacular 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.870
 but I would just like a 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.030
 flannel shirt on it and I like it stop 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.989
 It was totally a solid material 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.340
 is not like this very thin one 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.469
 flannel the planets so be it 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.590
 but that's just what it is 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:09.129
 really solid material 100 percent 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.980
 cotton and keeps you much warmer 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.639
 as such a quick regers only fifth in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.440

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.470
 secondhand shops to watch there are 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.409
 Very often in high quality 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.599

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.639
