00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
place I'm going to go this way actually

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
place I'm going to go this way actually
and<00:00:44.360> in<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:47.129> place<00:00:47.370> where

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and in here is the place where

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
and in here is the place where
everything<00:00:48.090> happens<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.020> careful<00:00:49.200> okay

sandy<00:00:49.980> creeper<00:00:50.340> spawn<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.940> should<00:00:51.719> come

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
sandy creeper spawn in here should come

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
sandy creeper spawn in here should come
warm<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> happen<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
warm that to happen so I'm just going to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.410 
warm that to happen so I'm just going to
like<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.670> many<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.300> get

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
like that so this is many more and get

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.560 
like that so this is many more and get
arrows<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> stuff<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.390> this<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
arrows and stuff like that so this is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.060 
arrows and stuff like that so this is
basically<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> light

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
basically it so I'm just going to light

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.200 
basically it so I'm just going to light
this<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> 16<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.129> 16<00:01:05.210> 32

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this up so I think it's a 16 by 16 32

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.289 
this up so I think it's a 16 by 16 32
actually<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.460> as<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.270> see

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
actually I think and as you can see

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
actually I think and as you can see
water<00:01:09.720> through<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.200> flows<00:01:10.590> everything<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
water through it flows everything to the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
water through it flows everything to the
center<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.270> place<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.530> pushed

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
center of the place where they be pushed

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.210 
center of the place where they be pushed
up<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.110> can't<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:16.380> explain<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.009> well

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
up now I can't really explain this well

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.120 
up now I can't really explain this well
but<00:01:17.580> everything's<00:01:18.420> pushing<00:01:18.930> everything<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but everything's pushing everything that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
but everything's pushing everything that
way<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.700> mob<00:01:20.880> thing<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
way to the mob thing which I'm going to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
way to the mob thing which I'm going to
head<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.790> gonna<00:01:24.000> light<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
head to now I'm just gonna light up this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.679 
head to now I'm just gonna light up this
area<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.049> i<00:01:25.259> won't<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.830> burnt<00:01:26.100> burnt<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.540> they

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
area so i won't get burnt burnt and they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
area so i won't get burnt burnt and they
killed<00:01:28.020> anyway<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.700> i<00:01:29.939> head<00:01:30.119> across<00:01:30.299> here

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
killed anyway so if i head across here

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.399 
killed anyway so if i head across here
because<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.829> racking<00:01:32.040> did<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.409> as

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
because I just racking did there and as

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
because I just racking did there and as
you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> signs<00:01:35.369> they're<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you can see the signs they're there and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
you can see the signs they're there and
they're<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.900> everyone<00:01:37.439> there's<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.460> be

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
they're so everyone there's gonna be

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.649 
they're so everyone there's gonna be
sort<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> signs<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.090> pushes

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
sort of signs and that basically pushes

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.179 
sort of signs and that basically pushes
the<00:01:42.810> mobs<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.530> they're<00:01:43.770> gonna

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the mobs there and then they're gonna

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.819 
the mobs there and then they're gonna
automatically<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:44.939> straight<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
automatically go straight up because the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.499 
automatically go straight up because the
director<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.399> sign<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.790> sort<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> gap

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
director the sign is sort of like a gap

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
director the sign is sort of like a gap
as<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.079> there<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> signs<00:01:49.710> are

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
as you can see there with the signs are

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
as you can see there with the signs are
and<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> gap<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and there's a gap there and that just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.820 
and there's a gap there and that just
