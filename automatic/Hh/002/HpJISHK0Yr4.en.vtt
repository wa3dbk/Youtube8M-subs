00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
flipped kind of at the bottom so I'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.780 
flipped kind of at the bottom so I'm
just<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.979> straight<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
just going to go straight with all of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
just going to go straight with all of
this<00:01:45.049> okay<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:46.979> side

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this okay and then on this other side

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
this okay and then on this other side
I'm<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> pull<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I'm just going to pull that up with a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
I'm just going to pull that up with a
clip<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> rounded<00:01:50.970> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
clip and you can see it's rounded but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.460 
clip and you can see it's rounded but
that's<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.780> ground<00:01:52.020> brushed<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that's just because I ground brushed it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.130 
that's just because I ground brushed it
to<00:01:52.619> give<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.070> volume<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.899> barely

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to give it some volume so just barely

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
to give it some volume so just barely
come<00:01:55.829> down<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:57.049> barely<00:01:58.049> flip<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:59.299> just

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
come down and barely flip that out just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.929 
come down and barely flip that out just
so<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> flip<00:02:01.439> flip<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.820> it's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so it's not like a flip flip but so it's

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.190 
so it's not like a flip flip but so it's
not<00:02:06.149> straight

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.820 

okay<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.730> part<00:02:13.560> comes<00:02:14.560> straight

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
okay and then this part comes straight

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.850 
okay and then this part comes straight
down<00:02:14.890> with<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:18.840> all<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.380> to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
down with that and all of this to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.610 
down with that and all of this to
