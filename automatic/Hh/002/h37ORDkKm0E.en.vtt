00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
hi today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.459 
hi today I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:08.809> a<00:00:09.080> lazy<00:00:09.740> rat<00:00:10.040> bun<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:10.639> a<00:00:11.150> disc<00:00:11.420> bun<00:00:11.719> but

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
make a lazy rat bun and a disc bun but

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.680 
make a lazy rat bun and a disc bun but
this<00:00:12.650> bun<00:00:12.920> is<00:00:13.070> very<00:00:13.250> similar<00:00:13.549> to<00:00:13.730> a<00:00:14.209> lazy<00:00:14.420> rat

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
this bun is very similar to a lazy rat

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.750 
this bun is very similar to a lazy rat
bun<00:00:14.930> in<00:00:15.080> my<00:00:15.199> opinion<00:00:15.650> because<00:00:15.980> it's<00:00:16.340> basically

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
bun in my opinion because it's basically

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.359 
bun in my opinion because it's basically
too<00:00:17.119> lazy<00:00:17.330> rat<00:00:17.600> buns<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:18.320> I<00:00:18.560> figured<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:19.250> would

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
too lazy rat buns so I figured I would

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.920 
too lazy rat buns so I figured I would
make<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.789> tutorial<00:00:20.150> for<00:00:20.510> both<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.840> them

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
make the tutorial for both of them

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.249 
make the tutorial for both of them
together<00:00:21.400> just<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.640> clarify<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.839> show<00:00:24.169> you

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
together just to clarify and show you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.189 
together just to clarify and show you
how<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.470> do<00:00:24.679> it<00:00:25.060> but<00:00:26.060> first<00:00:26.390> when<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:26.960> are

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199

doesn't get snagged all right so first

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.160 
doesn't get snagged all right so first
thing<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.290> put<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:51.650> into<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:53.890> ponytail<00:00:54.890> and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
thing is to put it into a ponytail and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.300 
thing is to put it into a ponytail and
personally<00:00:57.170> I<00:00:57.200> like<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.620> have<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:57.950> ponytail

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
personally I like to have a ponytail

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.570 
personally I like to have a ponytail
that's<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:59.870> little<00:01:00.440> bit<00:01:00.620> on<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.070> lower<00:01:01.250> side

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
that's a little bit on the lower side

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.010 
that's a little bit on the lower side
because<00:01:01.880> it<00:01:01.970> seems<00:01:02.180> like<00:01:02.270> my<00:01:02.450> hair<00:01:02.630> tangles

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
because it seems like my hair tangles

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.899 
because it seems like my hair tangles
less<00:01:03.200> that<00:01:03.500> way<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.189> if<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.369> try<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.580> make<00:01:04.790> it

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
less that way then if I try to make it

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.980 
less that way then if I try to make it
up<00:01:05.000> too<00:01:05.210> high<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.119> do<00:01:08.210> like<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.630> try<00:01:08.840> and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
up too high but I do like to try and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.599 
up too high but I do like to try and
vary<00:01:09.200> where<00:01:09.499> I<00:01:09.530> put<00:01:09.829> my<00:01:09.979> bun<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.399> it's<00:01:10.520> not

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
vary where I put my bun so it's not

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:11.919 
vary where I put my bun so it's not
always<00:01:10.880> in<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:10.999> same<00:01:11.179> place<00:01:11.329> all<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.719> time

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
always in the same place all the time

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.099 
always in the same place all the time
then<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.890> stresses<00:01:13.189> those<00:01:13.549> same<00:01:13.899> strands<00:01:14.899> out

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
then it stresses those same strands out

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.789 
then it stresses those same strands out
the<00:01:15.289> most<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.719> get<00:01:17.869> tired<00:01:18.079> my<00:01:18.320> follicles

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
yeah that isn't just fun I have a little

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.210 
yeah that isn't just fun I have a little
bit<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> scalp<00:04:29.050> cleavage<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:29.860> there<00:04:30.069> cuz

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
bit of scalp cleavage going on there cuz

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.330 
bit of scalp cleavage going on there cuz
I've<00:04:30.340> got<00:04:30.490> fine<00:04:30.729> hair<00:04:31.590> big<00:04:32.590> chunk<00:04:32.889> of<00:04:33.009> my<00:04:33.099> scalp

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
I've got fine hair big chunk of my scalp

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.830 
I've got fine hair big chunk of my scalp
showing<00:04:33.639> into<00:04:33.759> that<00:04:34.620> um<00:04:36.539> anyway<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:37.599> the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
showing into that um anyway so the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360 
showing into that um anyway so the
reason<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.289> believe<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.590> those<00:04:38.800> are<00:04:38.830> kind<00:04:39.099> of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
reason I believe that those are kind of

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.680 
reason I believe that those are kind of
the<00:04:39.490> same<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:39.909> that<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> discipline<00:04:40.569> is

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
the same is that the discipline is

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.869 
the same is that the discipline is
basically<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.470> lazy<00:04:41.860> rat<00:04:42.099> buns<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.699> nice

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
basically to lazy rat buns the nice

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.369 
basically to lazy rat buns the nice
thing<00:04:43.090> about<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.389> disc<00:04:43.599> bun<00:04:43.840> is<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.229> can

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
thing about the disc bun is that you can

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.460 
thing about the disc bun is that you can
do<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.650> at<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.830> shorter<00:04:45.190> length<00:04:45.430> then<00:04:45.819> you<00:04:46.300> can<00:04:46.569> a

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
do it at a shorter length then you can a

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.610 
do it at a shorter length then you can a
lazy<00:04:47.919> rat<00:04:48.220> bun<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.699> if<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.509> have<00:04:49.750> thicker
