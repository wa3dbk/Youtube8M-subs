the walls to open and close you see and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.710 
the walls to open and close you see and
if<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.440> notice<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.460> stair<00:01:23.060> right<00:01:23.659> in

if you notice we have a stair right in

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.450 
if you notice we have a stair right in
front<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.990> us<00:01:24.140> that's<00:01:24.470> kind<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.770> an<00:01:24.890> angle<00:01:25.340> on

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
front of us that's kind of an angle on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.820 
front of us that's kind of an angle on
the<00:01:25.580> side<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.260> hit<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.470> on<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.619> top

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
the side and if you hit it on the top

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.560 
the side and if you hit it on the top
corner<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.490> allows<00:01:28.790> us<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.119> activate<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
corner it allows us to activate the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.230 
corner it allows us to activate the
lever<00:01:29.869> with<00:01:30.170> no<00:01:30.350> issue<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.580> spot

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
lever with no issue there that spot

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.390 
lever with no issue there that spot
right<00:01:32.420> there<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:32.810> actually<00:01:33.280> like<00:01:34.280> an

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
right there is actually like an

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.219 
right there is actually like an
invisible<00:01:34.640> spot<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.570> allows<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.080> to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
invisible spot that allows you to

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.000 
invisible spot that allows you to
activate<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.860> lever<00:01:37.010> with<00:01:37.310> no<00:01:37.549> issue<00:01:39.010> so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
activate the lever with no issue so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.590 
activate the lever with no issue so
let's<00:01:40.159> get<00:01:40.280> down<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.460> materials<00:01:41.030> then<00:01:41.479> use<00:01:41.570> a

let's get down to materials then use a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
let's get down to materials then use a
block<00:01:41.840> of<00:01:41.990> your<00:01:42.049> choice<00:01:42.110> some<00:01:42.590> stairs<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.250> half

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
way right across perfect place a block

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.790 
way right across perfect place a block
there<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.880> dust<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:23.230> like<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.590> to

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
there and to dust just like so to

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.600 
there and to dust just like so to
connect<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> rest

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.150 

and<00:04:29.610> once<00:04:29.730> you<00:04:29.820> activated<00:04:30.530> both<00:04:31.530> Pistons

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
and once you activated both Pistons

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.120 
and once you activated both Pistons
should<00:04:32.670> work<00:04:32.850> perfectly<00:04:33.380> now<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.440> half<00:04:34.800> slabs

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
should work perfectly now the half slabs

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.740 
should work perfectly now the half slabs
on<00:04:35.340> top<00:04:35.550> doesn't<00:04:35.940> work<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.330> could<00:04:36.480> make<00:04:36.630> that

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
on top doesn't work you could make that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.410 
on top doesn't work you could make that
a<00:04:36.810> solid<00:04:37.170> block<00:04:37.490> it's<00:04:38.490> not<00:04:38.610> an<00:04:38.730> issue<00:04:38.850> but<00:04:39.270> if

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
a solid block it's not an issue but if

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.090 
a solid block it's not an issue but if
you<00:04:39.510> guys<00:04:39.630> want<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.900> conserve<00:04:40.290> items<00:04:40.860> that's

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
you guys want to conserve items that's
