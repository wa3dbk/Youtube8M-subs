00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.210
 ah 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:12.190
 heart melon melon melon 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 better in the heart of your heart than 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.320
 black keep where the bad is the least 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 by 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.660
 we all talk about the heart we say that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.360
 we feel with the heart we relate the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 love with the heart we give away hearts 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.210
 and we even heard songs that speak of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.210
 heart 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.280
 there are even those who still firmly believe 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.160
 that emotions come from the heart 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.760
 the reason is simple and that is that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.720
 emotions change the rhythm of the heart 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 How are you 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.100
 although they do not come from 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.510
 the heart is a great world that opens 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.270
 behind the traditional image that 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.520
 we know 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.220
 is a muscular organ located between 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 Mormons in the center of the chest whose 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
 Size is approximately for each 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 person the size of his two fists 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 united is responsible for pumping the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 blood to the whole body 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 providing oxygen and nutrients to the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 cells and tissues during the cycle 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 cardiac recurrence a series of phases 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 called systole or contraction and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 diastole or relaxation to answer 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 to the energetic demands of the body the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.320
 heart should beat more than 100 thousand times 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 up to date 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.400
 Within the heart there are four cavities 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 the upper ones are called atria 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.140
 they are very small with a capacity 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.970
 Approximately 50 milliliters of blood 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.910
 the lower ones are called ventricles 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.440
 somewhat larger than the atria 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.410
 They have a capacity of about 60 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.780
 milliliters this extraordinary set 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.150
 of small cavities is capable of 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.210
 pump about 7000 liters of blood 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.820
 day the atria and the ventricles 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.039
 team work the atria are 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.050
 they fill with blood that they then expel 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.550
 towards the ventricles 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 while the ventricles pump the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.420
 blood expelling the heart of 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.650
 atria fill up again 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.150
 preparing for the next 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 contraction 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.129
 the left side of the heart sends 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.650
 fresh and clean blood to the body is 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.450
 blood contains a lot of oxygen and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.480
 this oxygen is what keeps the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.090
 cells the cells use oxygen 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.129
 making carbon dioxide and other 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.720
 things you need to give back to the 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.720
 blood to take them 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 the right side of the heart takes now 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 the relay carries the blood without oxygen and 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.540
 used up to the lungs to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.220
 cool it during breathing on 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.739
 carbon dioxide is separated from the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.530
 blood when exhaling and new oxygen 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.420
 enter by inhaling now this new 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 blood has the oxygen it needs 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.069
 to go back to the left side of 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.190
 heart and start all over again all 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.830
 It happens in less than a minute 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.590
 before each heartbeat the heart fills 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.440
 of blood and then it contracts for 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.070
 expel her that she does all day and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.820
 all night all the time the heart 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.820
 not for 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.830
 but the pumped blood is not going to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.440
 any place four valves are the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.080
 for defining where the blood goes 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.379
 task is to open or close in a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:41.660
 automatic mitral valve and the 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.739
 tricuspid valve work between 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.739
 atria and ventricles 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.640
 the other two are called aortic valve 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.830
 and pulmonary valve and they take care of 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.140
 control the flow as the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.510
 blood comes from the heart 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.010
 all these valves work to make 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.560
 that the blood keeps flowing 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.200
 they open to let the blood advance 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.909
 and then they close quickly for 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.909
 prevent blood from flowing back 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.170
 to the movement of blood through 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.900
 heart and by the organism it is called 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.410
 circulation and the heart does it too 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.329
 it only takes 60 seconds to pump 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.329
 blood to every cell of the body 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.620
 the assistants who assure that the blood 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.500
 move everywhere are the glasses 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.600
 blood the heart is attached to them 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.600
 and they are the conductors of the blood 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.780
 the blood vessels that carry the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.819
 blood out of the heart the blood 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.249
 fresh full of oxygen are called 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.989
 arteries 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:49.359
 and those who carry the blood to the 

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:52.389
 heart blood without oxygen and with 

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:54.819
 waste is called veins there are many 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.949
 veins and arteries all over the body if 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.349
 we put all the blood vessels in 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.799
 row could wrap the earth two 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.799
 times 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.600
 although the heart is inside the body 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.530
 there's a great way to watch him work 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.000
 from outside feeling the pulse can 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.680
 find the pulse when pressing 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.070
 slightly at the bottom of the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.750
 wrist just below the thumb you will know that 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.720
 has found the pulse when you feel a 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.000
 small heartbeat under the skin every beat 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.340
 is caused by the contraction of 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.350
 heart 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.710
 if you want to know what is its frequency 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.570
 cardiac use a watch with a second hand and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.190
 count and how many beats you feel in a 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.770
 minute 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.580
 when it is resting probably 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.080
 you will notice about 70 80 beats per minute 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.120
 when we do physical activity the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.460
 body needs more fresh blood 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.530
 that's why the heart pumps faster 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.680
 to supply fresh blood that the 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.870
 body needs the heart is a great 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.630
 worker who needs to take care always 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.690
 and keep it happy most of the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.760
 children are born with a healthy heart and is 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.760
 important to keep it in good shape 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.229
 first the heart is a muscle and there 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.870
 than to exercise it to make it strong in 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:20.139
 the child needs at least 60 minutes of 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.550
 daily physical activity second the 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.960
 Consumption of a variety of foods 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.169
 Healthy is excellent for the heart 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.490
 avoid fatty foods 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.930
 lower the sugar and limit the salt 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.930
 will also keep your heart happy 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:42.300
 third, cigarette smoke is deadly 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:44.939
 for the life of the heart the heart and 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.639
 the blood vessels abhor the smoke 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:53.729
 because it makes it harder for them to perform 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:55.589
 your tasks the heart is amazing and 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.709
 manages to let blood flow through the body 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:01.349
 already existed before birth and 

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:04.770
 pump blood all your life if the 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:07.189
 heart beats, life, let's give life to 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.189
 heart 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.930
 prevent keeps the pace 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:18.500
 be a responsible heart 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:24.170
 heart melon melon melon 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:29.260
 better in my heart the heart of the 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.260
 mind less than the bad I miss the least
