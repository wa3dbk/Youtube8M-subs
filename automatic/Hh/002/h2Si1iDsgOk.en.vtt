00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 the 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.960
 the 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.969
 in this demonstration video of windows 8 we will show you how to log in 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.439
 works 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 if you get inside bag on the street it will be for the screens 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.000
 the back wall department can of course be adjusted yourself, but that is another 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.419
 sample images of windows 8 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.449
 you also see the time and date on it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.190
 and left under the date if you are here in that coaching 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.849
 a so-called clip 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.059
 and various icons can be added to this screen to quickly check the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.410
 status 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.470
 this could be according to the number of messages on facebook 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.020
 in this case the states of a network connection that is not there 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.360
 Whether or not you want to try new ones you can think of anything in one 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 club can be displayed at the moment there are unfortunately not that whole 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.070
 very much available but that will of course change as 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.340
 windows 8 is really coming on the market 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.030
 shortly as I have had this screen on the space bar new another 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.230
 the window appears we can also just write it with disclosures 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.030
 because he uses a few stitches 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.610
 shortly then you see two were there at the same time 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.500
 compliments that in this case a clubroom is a user only in mountains 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.710
 is a windows live with which you can also run one 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.850
 if the accent is tasty 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.240
 gotta do some good in shape 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.710
 we pull kenny option ball from trainers 7 and windows vista 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.200
 only the previous editions is again 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.630
 is that you also see an I can get caught by a header goal 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.200
 password 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.590
 they have a beautiful image, the intention is that 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 you do three actions in this image 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.850
 which is the same as your password 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 for instance 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.430
 tone 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.150
 the line 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.460
 or another line 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.720
 and you should walk but in this case if the ten is not there tomorrow 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.490
 The brand indicates that it is not good 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.940
 to fill both barracks 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 ing 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.520
 hence logged in 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 and then we get this screen in front of us 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.489
 more on this later
