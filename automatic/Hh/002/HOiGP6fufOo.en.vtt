chips for which we need raw banana you

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.640 
chips for which we need raw banana you
can<00:00:08.280> use<00:00:08.400> any<00:00:08.610> raw<00:00:08.940> banana<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.870> prefer<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
can use any raw banana but I prefer to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.430 
can use any raw banana but I prefer to
use<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.219> plantain<00:00:12.000> raw<00:00:12.420> banana<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:13.259> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
use the plantain raw banana that is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.099 
use the plantain raw banana that is
authentically<00:00:14.429> used<00:00:14.759> first<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.719> am<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.839> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
authentically used first I am going to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.010 
authentically used first I am going to
cut<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> tip<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> tail<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.449> banana

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
cut that tip and the tail of that banana

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.769 
cut that tip and the tail of that banana
then<00:00:20.300> just<00:00:21.300> cut<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> slit<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.590> banana<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
then just cut a slit in the banana and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.450 
then just cut a slit in the banana and
from<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.230> tear<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.250> skin<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:28.460> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
from there you can tear the skin off it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.569 
from there you can tear the skin off it
is<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.970> bit<00:00:30.480> difficult<00:00:30.990> job<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.369> do

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is a bit difficult job but you can do

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.720 
is a bit difficult job but you can do
that<00:00:32.759> easily<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.600> easily<00:00:33.870> tear<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that easily it will easily tear off so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
that easily it will easily tear off so
you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.000> continue<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> tear<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> skin

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you can continue that and tear the skin

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
you can continue that and tear the skin
off<00:00:38.399> completely<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:40.260> i<00:00:40.440> am<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
off completely and now i am going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.729 
off completely and now i am going to
slice<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.719> small<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> scissor<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.710> i

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
slice this into small the scissor what i

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
slice this into small the scissor what i
am<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.789> am<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
am going to do is I am going to use a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
am going to do is I am going to use a
slicer<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:51.000> am<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
slicer for this and I am going to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.760 
slicer for this and I am going to
directly<00:00:52.289> slice<00:00:52.920> their<00:00:53.280> chips<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.210> oil

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
directly slice their chips into the oil

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
directly slice their chips into the oil
the<00:00:55.770> reason<00:00:56.129> why<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> am<00:00:56.550> doing<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the reason why I am doing this is if I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
the reason why I am doing this is if I
slice<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.309> add<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> oil

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
slice it first and then add to the oil

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
slice it first and then add to the oil
even<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.469> careful<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.609> chips

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
even if you are very careful the chips

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
even if you are very careful the chips
may<00:01:03.149> stick<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.930> each<00:01:04.170> other<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> avoid

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
may stick with each other so to avoid

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
may stick with each other so to avoid
that<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.720> non<00:01:06.990> sticky<00:01:07.470> chips<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.950> am

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that and to get non sticky chips I am

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.690 
that and to get non sticky chips I am
slicing<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.299> directly<00:01:09.840> onto<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> oil<00:01:10.700> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
slicing it directly onto the oil so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.190 
slicing it directly onto the oil so
slice<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.740> oil<00:01:14.010> pan<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.369> hold

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
slice as much as the oil pan can hold

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.399 
slice as much as the oil pan can hold
leaving<00:01:16.200> no<00:01:16.530> gaps<00:01:16.890> between<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> chips

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
leaving no gaps between the chips

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.590 
leaving no gaps between the chips
continue<00:01:19.409> until<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.250> oil<00:01:20.280> pan<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.820> completely

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
continue until the oil pan is completely

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.289 
continue until the oil pan is completely
filled<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.350> chips<00:01:23.150> use<00:01:24.150> medium<00:01:24.780> flame<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
filled with chips use medium flame and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
filled with chips use medium flame and
the<00:01:27.299> oil<00:01:27.479> should<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.869> too<00:01:28.080> hot<00:01:28.350> before<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the oil should not be too hot before it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.330 
the oil should not be too hot before it
gets<00:01:29.640> much<00:01:30.180> hotter<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.170> slice<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.950> chips

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
gets much hotter you can slice the chips

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
gets much hotter you can slice the chips
to<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.509> takes<00:01:33.720> its<00:01:33.960> own<00:01:34.140> time

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to it so that it takes its own time

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.539 
to it so that it takes its own time
slowly<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:36.299> crispier<00:01:36.869> keep<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.100> stirring

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
slowly to get crispier keep on stirring

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569 
slowly to get crispier keep on stirring
it<00:01:38.939> frequently<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> chips<00:01:41.250> gets

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it frequently so that all the chips gets

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.800 
it frequently so that all the chips gets
cooked<00:01:41.939> evenly<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:45.030> takes<00:01:45.210> around<00:01:45.420> about

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
cooked evenly so it takes around about

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
cooked evenly so it takes around about
five<00:01:46.320> books<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.780> after<00:01:48.780> some<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.979> can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
five books so after some time you can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
five books so after some time you can
see<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> bubbles<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.149> stopped<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:51.750> means

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
see the bubbles have stopped which means

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.230 
see the bubbles have stopped which means
the<00:01:52.320> chips<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.770> ready<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> also

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
the chips is ready now and it is also

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
the chips is ready now and it is also
crispier<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:58.009> texture<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.280> hear<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> sound

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
crispier in texture I can hear the sound

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630 
crispier in texture I can hear the sound
now<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.170> dissolved<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.799> teaspoon<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
now I have dissolved one teaspoon of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.149 
now I have dissolved one teaspoon of
salt<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.119> half<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.570> cup<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.899> water<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:05.009> I'm

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
oil won't spatter out because the oil is
completely<00:02:16.870> covered<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:17.230> chips<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.130> only

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
completely covered with chips so only

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.890 
completely covered with chips so only
the<00:02:18.670> chips<00:02:18.910> will<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.240> absorbing<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the chips will be absorbing the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.830 
the chips will be absorbing the
saltwater<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.430> reason<00:02:21.790> why<00:02:21.970> i<00:02:22.000> am<00:02:22.180> using<00:02:22.420> salt

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
saltwater the reason why i am using salt

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.350 
saltwater the reason why i am using salt
water<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.530> if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.220> take<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.550> chips<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
water is if you take the chips out and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.199 
water is if you take the chips out and
then<00:02:25.870> sprinkle<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> salt<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:27.760> potato

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
then sprinkle the salt like potato

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.630 
then sprinkle the salt like potato
wafers<00:02:28.450> or<00:02:28.900> any<00:02:29.350> other<00:02:29.530> wafers<00:02:29.950> banana<00:02:30.400> chips

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
wafers or any other wafers banana chips

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120 
wafers or any other wafers banana chips
does<00:02:30.880> not<00:02:31.090> hold<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.510> salt<00:02:31.840> properly<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.980> in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
does not hold the salt properly so in

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.220 
does not hold the salt properly so in
order<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.910> salt<00:02:34.180> completely<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.140> am

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
order to get the salt completely I am

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.690 
order to get the salt completely I am
doing<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> again<00:02:38.770> continue<00:02:39.310> till<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
doing this so again continue till the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
doing this so again continue till the
bubbles<00:02:40.090> stopped<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.930> now<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.010> ready<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.700> am

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
bubbles stopped and now it is ready I am

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.630 
bubbles stopped and now it is ready I am
going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.660> take<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.560> drain<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.520> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
going to take it and drain it in a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.479 
going to take it and drain it in a
tissue<00:02:45.880> paper<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> observe<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.650> excess<00:02:48.070> oil

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
tissue paper to a observe the excess oil

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.080 
tissue paper to a observe the excess oil
now<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.750> am<00:02:50.260> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.190> continue<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.820> process

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
now I am going to continue the process

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.199 
now I am going to continue the process
in<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:53.019> same<00:02:53.260> oil<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:55.090> be

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
in the same oil so here you have to be

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.380 
in the same oil so here you have to be
careful<00:02:55.420> now<00:02:55.930> because<00:02:57.000> even<00:02:58.000> though<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
careful now because even though the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.009 
careful now because even though the
chips<00:02:59.080> are<00:02:59.230> absorbed<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.890> salt<00:03:00.370> from<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.820> oil

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
chips are absorbed the salt from the oil

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.720 
chips are absorbed the salt from the oil
still<00:03:02.019> there<00:03:02.290> will<00:03:02.410> be<00:03:02.560> some<00:03:02.830> salt<00:03:03.100> content<00:03:03.370> in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
still there will be some salt content in

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.660 
still there will be some salt content in
the<00:03:03.910> oil<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:05.019> in<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> next<00:03:05.530> batch<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.950> chips

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
the oil so in the next batch of chips

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.400 
the oil so in the next batch of chips
what<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.930> have<00:03:07.959> to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
what you have to do is you have to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.550 
what you have to do is you have to
reduce<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.340> amount<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.850> salt<00:03:10.269> water<00:03:10.570> because

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
reduce the amount of salt water because

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.580 
reduce the amount of salt water because
it<00:03:12.550> will<00:03:12.760> observe<00:03:13.120> because<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.170> chips<00:03:14.410> will

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it will observe because the chips will

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.910 
it will observe because the chips will
absorb<00:03:15.040> both<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.790> salt<00:03:16.269> from<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.750> oil<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.500> as

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
absorb both the salt from the oil and as

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.190 
absorb both the salt from the oil and as
well<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.640> salt<00:03:18.910> water<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:19.450> are<00:03:19.570> sprinkling

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
well as the salt water we are sprinkling

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.890 
well as the salt water we are sprinkling
so<00:03:20.769> if<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.070> are<00:03:21.160> using<00:03:21.400> one<00:03:22.060> handful<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.570> salt

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
so if you are using one handful of salt

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.050 
so if you are using one handful of salt
water<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> first<00:03:23.739> batch<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.519> have<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.970> use

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
water in the first batch you have to use

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.509 
water in the first batch you have to use
only<00:03:25.329> three<00:03:25.810> fourth<00:03:26.140> handful<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.650> salt<00:03:27.250> water

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
only three fourth handful of salt water

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.280 
only three fourth handful of salt water
in<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> next<00:03:28.060> batch<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:29.079> have<00:03:29.170> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
in the next batch and you have to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.620 
in the next batch and you have to
gradually<00:03:29.739> decrease<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.760> for<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.209> upcoming

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
gradually decrease it for the upcoming

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.860 
gradually decrease it for the upcoming
matches<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.730> also<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.299> are<00:03:34.329> going<00:03:34.690> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
matches and also if you are going to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.990 
matches and also if you are going to
reuse<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.530> oil<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.160> other<00:03:36.310> day<00:03:36.549> for<00:03:36.760> any

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
reuse the oil the other day for any

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.270 
reuse the oil the other day for any
other<00:03:37.150> purpose<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:38.350> very<00:03:38.560> careful<00:03:38.829> because

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
other purpose be very careful because

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.509 
other purpose be very careful because
still<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.239> will<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.570> some<00:03:40.840> salt<00:03:41.320> in<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.400> if

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
still it will have some salt in it so if

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.550 
still it will have some salt in it so if
you<00:03:42.640> are<00:03:42.730> using<00:03:42.880> any<00:03:43.180> vada<00:03:43.480> or<00:03:43.810> budgies<00:03:44.320> like

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
you are using any vada or budgies like

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.500 
you are using any vada or budgies like
that<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:45.190> have<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.579> use<00:03:45.700> only<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.239> half

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
that you have to use only the half

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.949 
that you have to use only the half
quantity<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.590> salt<00:03:48.070> kneader<00:03:48.959> remaining

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
quantity of the salt kneader remaining

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.750 
quantity of the salt kneader remaining
half<00:03:50.170> quantity<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.799> salt<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.310> will<00:03:51.549> absorb

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
half quantity of salt it will absorb

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.949 
half quantity of salt it will absorb
from<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.450> oil<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.769> be<00:03:53.950> careful<00:03:54.400> with<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.959> so

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
from the oil so be careful with that so

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.550 
from the oil so be careful with that so
I<00:03:55.989> am<00:03:56.260> continuing<00:03:56.860> with<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.640> other<00:03:57.970> banana

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
I am continuing with the other banana

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.860 
I am continuing with the other banana
the<00:03:59.560> same<00:03:59.799> process<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.790> only<00:04:01.150> differences<00:04:01.720> I

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
the same process the only differences I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.380 
the same process the only differences I
have<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.230> reduce<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.860> amount<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.549> salt<00:04:04.090> water

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
have to reduce the amount of salt water

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.620 
have to reduce the amount of salt water
required<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.130> have<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.370> fry<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.670> until<00:04:06.940> it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
required and I have to fry it until it

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.340 
required and I have to fry it until it
stops<00:04:08.140> bubbling<00:04:08.829> and<00:04:09.250> now<00:04:09.880> my<00:04:10.239> chips<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.780> ready

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
stops bubbling and now my chips is ready

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.860 
stops bubbling and now my chips is ready
so<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.190> time<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.820> reduced<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.420> quantity

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
so this time I have reduced the quantity

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.920 
so this time I have reduced the quantity
of<00:04:13.900> salt<00:04:14.290> water<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.479> again<00:04:16.479> it<00:04:16.600> will<00:04:16.720> start

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
of salt water and again it will start
