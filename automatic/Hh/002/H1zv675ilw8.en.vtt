00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
those use my master kills the way my

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.560 
those use my master kills the way my
setup<00:02:41.940> works<00:02:42.209> is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.720 

so<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.690> way<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:51.020> second<00:02:51.350> works<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.130> mix
