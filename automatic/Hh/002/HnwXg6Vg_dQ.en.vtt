the first time I've ever heard of a
phone<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.340> any<00:05:02.759> type<00:05:03.110> coming<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.289> coming

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
phone of any type coming with coming

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.580 
phone of any type coming with coming
with<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.490> coming<00:05:05.940> coming<00:05:06.590> pre-configured

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
with the coming coming pre-configured

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.830 
with the coming coming pre-configured
like<00:05:08.039> this<00:05:08.250> before<00:05:10.219> so<00:05:11.219> rather<00:05:11.819> bizarre<00:05:12.509> and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
like this before so rather bizarre and

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.200 
like this before so rather bizarre and
of<00:05:13.050> course<00:05:13.190> extremely<00:05:14.190> hard<00:05:14.759> to<00:05:14.909> believe

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
of course extremely hard to believe

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.209 
of course extremely hard to believe
especially<00:05:15.780> when<00:05:16.349> we<00:05:16.440> look<00:05:16.590> at<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.770> dates<00:05:16.979> and

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
especially when we look at the dates and

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.159 
especially when we look at the dates and
time<00:05:17.460> stamps<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.120> when<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.900> was<00:05:18.990> last

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
time stamps on when it was last

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.350 
time stamps on when it was last
synchronized<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.300> things<00:05:21.300> like<00:05:21.449> that<00:05:21.509> so<00:05:23.360> if

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
synchronized and things like that so if

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.149 
synchronized and things like that so if
anybody<00:05:24.870> out<00:05:24.960> there<00:05:25.319> can<00:05:26.479> check<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:28.740> somebody

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
anybody out there can check if somebody

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.879
