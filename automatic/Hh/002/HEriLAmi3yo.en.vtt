00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
I believe he's incorrect I'm pretty sure
he's<00:00:30.539> part<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> Hebrew<00:00:31.650> roots<00:00:31.859> movement

goes<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.590> these<00:00:37.680> odd<00:00:38.010> paths<00:00:39.530> regarding<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
goes into these odd paths regarding the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
goes into these odd paths regarding the
pronunciation<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.149> God's<00:00:42.420> name<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.230> who<00:00:43.710> is

I think it's chapter to it I can't
remember<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> says<00:02:10.739> something<00:02:10.920> about<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.080 
releases the Fallen Angels in the
bottomless<00:02:29.780> pit<00:02:30.079> so<00:02:30.769> obviously<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.760> devil

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
bottomless pit so obviously the devil

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.819 
bottomless pit so obviously the devil
can't<00:02:32.329> be<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.719> the<00:02:32.870> bottomless<00:02:33.200> pit<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:33.680> he's

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
can't be in the bottomless pit if he's

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.470 
can't be in the bottomless pit if he's
releasing<00:02:34.310> people<00:02:34.579> from<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.060> bottomless<00:02:35.420> pit

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
releasing people from the bottomless pit

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.920 
releasing people from the bottomless pit
so<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.739> would<00:02:36.889> appear<00:02:37.159> that<00:02:37.219> gadreel<00:02:37.939> if<00:02:38.480> he<00:02:38.750> is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
so it would appear that gadreel if he is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.909 
so it would appear that gadreel if he is
the<00:02:39.139> one<00:02:39.260> who<00:02:39.530> led<00:02:40.459> astray<00:02:40.760> Eve<00:02:41.030> he<00:02:42.019> obviously

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
the one who led astray Eve he obviously

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.520 
the one who led astray Eve he obviously
would<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.379> bottomless<00:02:45.650> pit<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.480> or

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
would be in the bottomless pit and or

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.009 
would be in the bottomless pit and or
Hardware<00:02:48.530> says<00:02:48.769> it's<00:02:48.919> called<00:02:49.159> in<00:02:49.310> Greek<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.989> I

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
Hardware says it's called in Greek so I

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.509 
Hardware says it's called in Greek so I
think<00:02:51.349> this<00:02:51.650> guy<00:02:51.829> would<00:02:51.889> actually<00:02:52.400> be

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
think this guy would actually be

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.789 
think this guy would actually be
incorrect<00:02:55.569> regarding<00:02:56.569> this<00:02:56.719> now<00:02:56.959> because

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
incorrect regarding this now because

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.039 
incorrect regarding this now because
he's<00:02:57.949> saying<00:02:58.250> Satan's<00:02:58.819> name<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.239> God<00:02:59.510> it'd

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
he's saying Satan's name is God it'd

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.679 
he's saying Satan's name is God it'd
actually<00:03:00.199> be<00:03:00.819> it'd<00:03:01.819> actually<00:03:01.969> be<00:03:02.180> incorrect

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
actually be it'd actually be incorrect

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.319 
actually be it'd actually be incorrect
because<00:03:03.079> I<00:03:03.469> think<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.909> would<00:03:05.150> be<00:03:05.299> a

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
because I think this would be a

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.720 
because I think this would be a
different<00:03:05.719> angel<00:03:06.169> further<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.069> don't<00:03:07.430> believe

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
different angel further I don't believe

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.390 
different angel further I don't believe
that<00:03:08.120> Keenan<00:03:08.870> was<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.530> seed<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:10.010> devil

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
that Keenan was the seed of the devil

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.369 
that Keenan was the seed of the devil
because<00:03:11.060> he's<00:03:11.930> not<00:03:12.139> a<00:03:12.169> Nephilim<00:03:12.879> okay<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
because he's not a Nephilim okay the

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.170 
because he's not a Nephilim okay the
fact<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.859> if<00:03:16.040> he<00:03:16.159> was<00:03:16.219> a<00:03:16.310> Nephilim<00:03:16.579> he<00:03:17.030> would

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
fact is if he was a Nephilim he would

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.199 
fact is if he was a Nephilim he would
have<00:03:17.299> been<00:03:17.479> part<00:03:18.439> of<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.099> whole<00:03:19.340> Genesis

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
have been part of the the whole Genesis

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.229 
have been part of the the whole Genesis
six<00:03:20.449> sons<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.900> God<00:03:21.109> thing<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.949> it<00:03:22.849> would<00:03:23.030> mean

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
six sons of God thing and it would mean

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.869 
six sons of God thing and it would mean
that<00:03:25.209> Evac<00:03:26.209> Chua<00:03:26.329> Lee<00:03:26.389> had<00:03:27.639> intercourse<00:03:28.639> with

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
that Evac Chua Lee had intercourse with

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.979 
that Evac Chua Lee had intercourse with
one<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.269> these<00:03:29.359> things<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:31.479> actually<00:03:32.479> think<00:03:32.810> he

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
one of these things I actually think he

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.860 
one of these things I actually think he
just<00:03:33.169> taught<00:03:33.439> her<00:03:34.209> secret<00:03:35.209> knowledge<00:03:35.569> that's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
just taught her secret knowledge that's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.030 
just taught her secret knowledge that's
why<00:03:36.049> it's<00:03:36.199> called<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.470> tree<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.709> knowledge<00:03:36.769> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
why it's called the tree of knowledge of

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.319 
why it's called the tree of knowledge of
good<00:03:37.129> and<00:03:37.220> evil<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.609> think<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:37.939> tree<00:03:38.209> is

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
good and evil I think the tree is

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.179 
good and evil I think the tree is
actually<00:03:38.509> referring<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.470> angel<00:03:39.799> itself

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
actually referring to the angel itself

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.719 
actually referring to the angel itself
and<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:41.569> know<00:03:41.689> he<00:03:42.620> goes<00:03:42.829> in<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.159> also<00:03:43.489> says

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
and you know he goes in and also says

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.780 
and you know he goes in and also says
that<00:03:43.759> the<00:03:44.090> term<00:03:44.299> Bale<00:03:45.609> translates<00:03:46.609> into

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
that the term Bale translates into

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.580 
that the term Bale translates into
English<00:03:47.150> as<00:03:47.299> Lord<00:03:47.659> which<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.079> not<00:03:48.259> correct

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
English as Lord which is not correct

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.539 
English as Lord which is not correct
either<00:03:48.889> actually<00:03:50.500> because<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.650> term<00:03:51.859> Adonai

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
either actually because the term Adonai

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.759 
either actually because the term Adonai
means<00:03:53.389> Lord<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:54.049> actually<00:03:54.229> in<00:03:54.680> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
means Lord and that's actually in the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.309 
means Lord and that's actually in the
Hebrew<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.579> that's<00:03:56.150> referring<00:03:56.569> directly<00:03:56.780> to

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
Hebrew and that's referring directly to

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.039 
Hebrew and that's referring directly to
God<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.949> the<00:03:58.129> Hebrew<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.329> means<00:03:59.509> Lord<00:03:59.870> as

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
God in the Hebrew and it means Lord as

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.939 
God in the Hebrew and it means Lord as
well<00:04:00.229> so<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:01.819> know<00:04:01.969> he's<00:04:02.209> kind<00:04:02.689> of<00:04:02.949> skewing

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
well so you know he's kind of skewing

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.569 
well so you know he's kind of skewing
what<00:04:04.099> it<00:04:04.219> actually<00:04:04.400> says

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
what it actually says

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.929 
what it actually says
okay<00:04:08.079> now<00:04:09.079> this<00:04:09.229> website<00:04:09.439> says<00:04:09.979> she's<00:04:10.189> dead

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
okay now this website says she's dead

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.499 
okay now this website says she's dead
realist<00:04:11.359> reduced<00:04:11.629> even<00:04:11.959> paradise<00:04:13.359> and<00:04:14.359> then

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:14.509 
realist reduced even paradise and then

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.240 
realist reduced even paradise and then
they<00:04:14.629> say<00:04:14.810> his<00:04:15.019> name<00:04:15.199> is<00:04:15.259> replaced<00:04:15.799> with<00:04:15.949> same

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
they say his name is replaced with same

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.459 
they say his name is replaced with same
but<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.909> thing<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.570> actually<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.109> can<00:04:18.289> be

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:18.469 
but the thing is is actually it can be

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.020 
but the thing is is actually it can be
saying<00:04:18.680> cuz<00:04:18.919> Satan<00:04:19.250> would<00:04:19.370> be<00:04:19.519> in<00:04:19.609> Tartarus

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
saying cuz Satan would be in Tartarus

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.060 
saying cuz Satan would be in Tartarus
because<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.539> was<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.840> judgment<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.529> the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
because that was the judgment of the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.510 
because that was the judgment of the
angels<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.510> Book<00:04:23.659> of<00:04:23.810> Enoch

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
angels in the Book of Enoch

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.010 
angels in the Book of Enoch
so<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:26.380> term<00:04:26.650> Lord<00:04:27.419> just<00:04:28.419> refers<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.750> having

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
so the term Lord just refers to having

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.010 
so the term Lord just refers to having
power<00:04:29.349> and<00:04:29.500> authority<00:04:29.590> over<00:04:30.099> others<00:04:30.509> okay<00:04:31.509> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
power and authority over others okay and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.710 
power and authority over others okay and
like<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.590> said<00:04:32.650> Adonai<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.699> actually<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> name<00:04:34.449> in

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
like I said Adonai is actually a name in

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.520 
like I said Adonai is actually a name in
Hebrew<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.800> refers<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.280> God<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.180> Lord<00:04:37.530> okay

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
Hebrew that refers to God is Lord okay

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.290 
Hebrew that refers to God is Lord okay
that<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.919> term<00:04:39.130> Lord<00:04:39.550> actually<00:04:40.000> came<00:04:40.270> from

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
that the term Lord actually came from

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.379 
that the term Lord actually came from
this<00:04:40.870> term<00:04:41.229> here<00:04:41.560> which<00:04:41.830> meant<00:04:42.099> basically
