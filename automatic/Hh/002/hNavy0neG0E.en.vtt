pods and bean seeds on these plants

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.310 
pods and bean seeds on these plants
these<00:00:30.119> leaves<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.510> starting<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> turn<00:00:31.050> yellow

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
these leaves are starting to turn yellow

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920 
these leaves are starting to turn yellow
too<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.890> mean<00:00:32.189> once<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> frost<00:00:33.450> hits<00:00:33.690> they'll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
too I mean once the frost hits they'll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
too I mean once the frost hits they'll
all<00:00:34.110> turn<00:00:34.320> yellow<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> fall<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.430> then

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
all turn yellow and fall off so then

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
all turn yellow and fall off so then
that<00:00:35.760> protein<00:00:36.180> source<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> gone<00:00:36.899> we've

that protein source is gone we've
already<00:00:37.739> showed<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.030> some

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
already showed you two and some

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.479 
already showed you two and some

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
in all the bean plants that we tested in

eating and the new nutritive value for

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
eating and the new nutritive value for
it<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> point<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.270> trying<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.600> make

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it but the point we're trying to make

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
it but the point we're trying to make
with<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:00.899> soybeans<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.980> once<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> all

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
with our soybeans is is once this is all

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
with our soybeans is is once this is all
gone<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.570> few<00:01:03.840> bean<00:01:04.049> pods<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
gone you got very few bean pods and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
gone you got very few bean pods and
seeds<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> eat<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.530> let<00:01:07.530> me

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
seeds for them to eat on here let me

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.240 
seeds for them to eat on here let me
just<00:01:07.740> grab<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.010> few<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.460> plants<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
just grab a few of these plants here and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.630 
just grab a few of these plants here and
show<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.970> difference<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:13.340> what<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> bean

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
show you the difference of what a bean

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
show you the difference of what a bean
plant<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.479> highly<00:01:15.689> shatter

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
plant now these are highly shatter

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
plant now these are highly shatter
resistant<00:01:16.680> beans<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.460> bean<00:01:17.700> pods

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
resistant beans me and these bean pods

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
resistant beans me and these bean pods
won't<00:01:18.420> open<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> dump<00:01:19.140> these<00:01:19.259> bean<00:01:19.530> seeds

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
won't open up and dump these bean seeds

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
won't open up and dump these bean seeds
out<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> ground<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:21.390> look<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> number

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
out on the ground but look at the number

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
out on the ground but look at the number
