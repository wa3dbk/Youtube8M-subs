meeting<00:04:27.650> water<00:04:27.980> filter<00:04:31.510> let's<00:04:32.510> take<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
meeting water filter let's take the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:05:18.330 
meeting water filter let's take the
second<00:04:33.260> part<00:04:33.560> here<00:04:35.050> see<00:04:36.050> how<00:04:36.290> we<00:04:36.350> do<00:04:36.650> this

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.869 

well<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.550> figure<00:05:19.909> out<00:05:20.029> is<00:05:20.180> where<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:21.580> how<00:05:22.580> that

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
well I figure out is where the how that

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.140 
well I figure out is where the how that
you<00:05:22.999> filter<00:05:23.419> itself<00:05:23.719> mail<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.379> I'm<00:05:24.469> going<00:05:24.620> to

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
you filter itself mail so I'm going to

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.339 
you filter itself mail so I'm going to
look<00:05:26.150> at<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.419> instruction<00:05:26.930> manual<00:05:27.229> to

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
look at the instruction manual to

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:42.129 
look at the instruction manual to
determine<00:05:27.379> that

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.790 

okay<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.919> filter<00:05:43.250> goes<00:05:43.460> in<00:05:43.699> that<00:05:44.199> in<00:05:45.199> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
okay so the filter goes in that in the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.129 
okay so the filter goes in that in the
top<00:05:46.189> of<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.430> housing<00:05:46.639> here<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:47.479> part<00:05:48.020> is

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
top of the housing here so that part is

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.429 
top of the housing here so that part is
just<00:05:48.439> a<00:05:48.590> little<00:05:48.860> there's<00:05:49.310> a<00:05:49.370> groove<00:05:49.580> there<00:05:50.439> and

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
just a little there's a groove there and

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.390 
just a little there's a groove there and
a<00:05:51.530> groove<00:05:51.710> there<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:51.949> that's<00:05:52.189> where<00:05:52.340> the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
a groove there and that's where the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.679 
a groove there and that's where the
filter<00:05:52.729> goes<00:05:52.879> but<00:05:53.090> I<00:05:53.120> want<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.300> make<00:05:53.389> sure<00:05:53.539> I've

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
filter goes but I want to make sure I've

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.879 
filter goes but I want to make sure I've

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
on this side see here's how it went in I

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.119 
on this side see here's how it went in I
just<00:06:08.180> put<00:06:08.539> it<00:06:08.659> like<00:06:08.689> that<00:06:09.080> with<00:06:09.889> the<00:06:09.979> black

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:10.129

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:20.559 
just put it like that with the black
side<00:06:10.430> facing<00:06:10.939> the<00:06:10.969> front<00:06:12.280> so<00:06:13.280> now<00:06:19.330> that's<00:06:20.330> it

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
side facing the front so now that's it

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.920
