00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
me more confidence and made it easier

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
me more confidence and made it easier
for<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.390> start<00:01:09.720> conversations<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.530> new

I started reading the Harry Potter books
but<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.570> involvement<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.320> the

but I think that my involvement with the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
but I think that my involvement with the
Harry<00:01:16.619> Potter<00:01:16.710> fandom<00:01:17.189> has<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.210> really

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
Harry Potter fandom has really really

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
Harry Potter fandom has really really
helped<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.049> self-esteem<00:01:19.520> helped<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:20.759> me

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
helped my self-esteem helped make me

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.510 
helped my self-esteem helped make me
more<00:01:21.119> outgoing<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.619> friendly<00:01:23.100> I've

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
always been a very creative person but I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
always been a very creative person but I
think<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.040> Harry<00:01:26.280> Potter<00:01:26.610> gave<00:01:27.000> me<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
think that Harry Potter gave me the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
think that Harry Potter gave me the
tools<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> inspiration<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.610> create<00:01:29.970> a
