00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
it on my desk for disc so the other

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.440 
it on my desk for disc so the other
mouse<00:02:11.640> I've<00:02:11.819> had<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.090> desk

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450

that's that's how they work like you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.240 
that's that's how they work like you
don't<00:02:15.580> need<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.940> pad<00:02:16.300> or<00:02:16.330> anything<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.250> actually

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
don't need a pad or anything so actually

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.010 
don't need a pad or anything so actually
you<00:02:18.730> don't<00:02:18.790> mouse<00:02:19.150> pad<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.630> turned<00:02:19.900> out

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
you don't mouse pad so I turned out

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.890 
you don't mouse pad so I turned out
using<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> user<00:02:20.650> manual<00:02:20.920> as<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> mouse<00:02:21.430> pad<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
using the user manual as a mouse pad it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.510 
using the user manual as a mouse pad it
works<00:02:23.080> perfectly<00:02:23.530> except<00:02:24.040> sometimes<00:02:24.220> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
works perfectly except sometimes it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890 
works perfectly except sometimes it
slides<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.120> fine<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.330> hold<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.810> down

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
