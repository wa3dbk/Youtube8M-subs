00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
definitely younger than me not too much

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
definitely younger than me not too much
younger<00:01:09.510> maybe<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.799> three<00:01:11.189> years

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
younger maybe like two three years

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
younger maybe like two three years
younger<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.659> he<00:01:13.530> didn't<00:01:13.770> live<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> same

both<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.689> cars<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> their<00:01:19.170> driveway<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.560> he

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
both had cars in their driveway so he

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
both had cars in their driveway so he

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
would park in the guest parking area and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
would park in the guest parking area and
the<00:01:22.770> guest<00:01:22.920> parking<00:01:23.189> area<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.549> right
