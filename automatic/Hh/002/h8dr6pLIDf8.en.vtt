00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 this is the view of the curve that the curve 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 of the fork looks at the black line that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 there is if you see and change asphalt 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.340
 has a cement patch grab 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 traction they go down the back straight 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.350
 fernandez will fly through the air 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 it went straight ahead I think the same 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.760
 michael andretti curve that has 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.359
 similar to me that the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 brakes 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.760
 Adrián Fernández has climbed straight 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 there that curve of the marko curve 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.579
 lasiça followed in front of blocked the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.250
 brakes and has not unlocked them and it has 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.910
 followed in front says it's okay 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 fortunately I was left with my mouth 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 open and without breath because the league 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 I do not stop it is not that it has been followed 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.730
 d'amics now we face with him if 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.160
 does not have something in the pits david yes 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 because about Adrian it seems he had 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.800
 commented that he had problems with the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.980
 clot were indeed worried 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 to be very careful that I could leave 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.970
 when he had problems with the club 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.150
 also in toronto 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.850
 an embassy that has blocked the brakes 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.850
 and has not managed to lift 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.710
 before it has continued front allocation 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
 to maritere and the whole Fernández family 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 he has raised and said that he is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.979
 very well the pits are closed the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.869
 picks are closed but I see that no 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 they're waiting for frankie and that's coming 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 third 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.710
 happily there is no public there before 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.710
 there was public 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.000
 and I could not stop remembering the accident 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.580
 of schumacher in england other 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 thing else the accelerator thoroughly 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.750
 and the limiter the accelerator thoroughly and 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.600
 the limiter just because we have 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.900
 listened to and we can not hear it from 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.740
 return 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 fortunately adrián fernández and is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.400
 everything has responded well the cante and vice 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.400
 a good fulfills its function 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.330
 Sir 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.820
 and start that we're listening to the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.900
 engine noise and even the limiter does not 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.269
 it seems to me 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 the limiter because in the limiter 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.040
 the second yellow way of the race 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 to include to reconstitute the wall 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.730
 tire 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.440
 the bottom is climbing 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.390
 no doubt they are words of the engineer that 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.700
 you also talk to Adrian Fernandez and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.010
 they make the strategies and they are commenting 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.990
 there are all the visitors of this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.310
 david shore ago and obviously this is going to 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.310
 take a time once again the question 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 very cute 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.240
 yes much has commented 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.500
 let's hear it again because very 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.330
 well I want to ask you the new one because 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.980
 Many have told us about the environment that 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.480
 there is in the letter how it varies with the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.550
 1t formula environment comes to that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.550
 formula one very early let's hear 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.630
 amazing one of the images of the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.840
 strong season of January today the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.510
 security that we have in the cars 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 as soon as it could have influenced the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.800
 festival to protect the neck look at the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.800
 true that this system
