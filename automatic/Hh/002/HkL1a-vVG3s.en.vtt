00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
and then it sends a link up to the main

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.870 
and then it sends a link up to the main
box

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
box

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.730

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
speaker to the wireless point and that

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.140 
speaker to the wireless point and that
should<00:04:56.660> plug<00:04:56.810> into<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> back<00:04:57.200> of<00:04:57.230> that<00:04:58.150> okay

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
should plug into the back of that okay

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.640 
should plug into the back of that okay
so<00:04:59.240> lastly<00:04:59.690> we've<00:04:59.870> got<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.050> speakers<00:05:00.500> to
