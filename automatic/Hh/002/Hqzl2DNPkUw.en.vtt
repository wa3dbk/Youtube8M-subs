give<00:05:20.800> me<00:05:20.920> up<00:05:21.100> right<00:05:21.460> now<00:05:22.350> why<00:05:23.350> should<00:05:23.500> we<00:05:23.590> put

give me up right now why should we put
this<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.340> think<00:05:25.060> in<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.080> parallel<00:05:26.500> to<00:05:27.100> where<00:05:27.310> the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
this I think in a parallel to where the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.540 
this I think in a parallel to where the
ginormous<00:05:27.790> one<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.510> think<00:05:28.570> that's<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:29.550> pretty

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
ginormous one is I think that's a pretty

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.320 
ginormous one is I think that's a pretty
effective<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.560> were<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:33.010> ask<00:05:33.040> me<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:34.150> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
effective if you were to ask me and you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.200 
effective if you were to ask me and you
agree<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.280> think<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.520> first<00:05:36.640> thing<00:05:36.790> we<00:05:36.880> want

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
agree so I think the first thing we want

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.720 
agree so I think the first thing we want
is<00:05:37.450> a<00:05:37.690> weapon<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.260> mass<00:05:38.290> destruction<00:05:38.710> or<00:05:39.460> a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
is a weapon of mass destruction or a

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.630 
is a weapon of mass destruction or a
weapon<00:05:40.660> of<00:05:40.750> some<00:05:40.780> destruction<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.650> find<00:05:41.920> some

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
weapon of some destruction I find some

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.250 
weapon of some destruction I find some
is<00:05:43.120> usually<00:05:43.420> bear<00:05:43.630> thin<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.290> added<00:05:44.590> nothing

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
is usually bear thin it added nothing

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.520 
is usually bear thin it added nothing
so<00:05:46.070> we<00:05:46.190> got<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.610> weapon<00:05:47.650> pick<00:05:48.790> so<00:05:49.790> now<00:05:49.970> what<00:05:50.530> so
