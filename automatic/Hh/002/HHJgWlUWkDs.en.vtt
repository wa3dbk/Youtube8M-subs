00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.150 
okay so wait so first you have to route
the<00:03:23.450> floor<00:03:23.660> up<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.799> build<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
the floor up there you have to build the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.660 
the floor up there you have to build the
wall<00:03:26.890> then<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.190> knock<00:03:28.340> down<00:03:28.370> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
wall then you have to knock down the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.390 
wall then you have to knock down the
wall<00:03:28.700> knock<00:03:29.690> out<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> wall<00:03:30.170> then<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.100> have<00:03:31.280> to

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
wall knock out the wall then you have to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.870 
wall knock out the wall then you have to
knock<00:03:31.549> down<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.030> wall<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:34.160> first<00:03:34.400> year<00:03:34.580> when

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
you can't knock down the wall we'll find

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.190 
you can't knock down the wall we'll find
that<00:03:37.070> out<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.420> then<00:03:38.540> we'll<00:03:38.660> lay<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.959> out<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that out but then we'll lay this out and

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.100 
that out but then we'll lay this out and
sketch<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.650> out<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:41.299> we<00:03:41.570> obviously<00:03:41.720> need

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
sketch this out and we obviously need

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.940 
sketch this out and we obviously need
new<00:03:42.350> hardware<00:03:43.040> new<00:03:44.200> vanity<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.590> know<00:03:47.950> we'll

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
new hardware new vanity you know we'll

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.580 
new hardware new vanity you know we'll
see<00:03:49.160> two<00:03:49.910> sinks<00:03:50.269> would<00:03:50.390> be<00:03:50.480> nice<00:03:50.690> right<00:03:53.590> for

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
come all the way over and then once we

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.610
