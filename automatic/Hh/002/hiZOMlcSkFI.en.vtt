that the parents are facing at this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.270 
that the parents are facing at this
point<00:01:16.619> huge<00:01:17.720> well<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.100> what

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
point huge well they really they what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
point huge well they really they what
they<00:01:20.460> were<00:01:20.520> told<00:01:20.759> initially<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> babies

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they were told initially that the babies

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
they were told initially that the babies
probably<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> brain<00:01:23.009> had<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.460> formed<00:01:23.939> enough

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
probably the brain had not formed enough

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
probably the brain had not formed enough
for<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.810> breathe<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.979> their<00:01:26.250> own<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
for them to breathe on their own and the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
for them to breathe on their own and the
babies<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.920> 3:1<00:01:29.640> let<00:01:30.090> me<00:01:30.180> see

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
babies and that was about 3:1 let me see

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
babies and that was about 3:1 let me see
that<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.720> product<00:01:31.320> four<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.619> five<00:01:31.770> weeks<00:01:32.009> ago

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that was product four or five weeks ago

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.030 
that was product four or five weeks ago
as<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.570> happens<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> babies<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.560> breathing

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
as it happens the babies are breathing

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.230 
as it happens the babies are breathing
on<00:01:35.130> their<00:01:35.280> own<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.579> they've<00:01:35.729> passed<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
on their own so they've passed that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
on their own so they've passed that
hurdle<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.170> next<00:01:37.470> hurdle<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
hurdle the next hurdle is for them to be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.179 
hurdle the next hurdle is for them to be
able<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> feed<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.770> able<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> feed

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
able to feed and to be able to feed

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
able to feed and to be able to feed
independently<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> trip<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
independently and and the trip the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
independently and and the trip the
problem<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.829> two<00:01:44.460> mouths<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
problem is that they have two mouths two

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.499 
problem is that they have two mouths two
noses<00:01:45.630> two<00:01:46.290> brains<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:47.640> set<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> lungs<00:01:48.149> one

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
noses two brains one set of lungs one

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319 
noses two brains one set of lungs one
heart<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.020> stomach<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.210> if

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
heart one stomach and you know that if

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
heart one stomach and you know that if
you<00:01:51.479> breathe<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.020> same<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.680> you're

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
