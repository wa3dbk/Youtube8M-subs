00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
can see here is the engineer sample

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
can see here is the engineer sample
we'll<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> working<00:00:13.559> sample<00:00:13.980> mean<00:00:14.099> two

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we'll have the working sample mean two

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.990 
we'll have the working sample mean two
weeks<00:00:14.940> later<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.680> MP<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.980> think<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.760> month

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
weeks later and MP I think one month

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.480 
weeks later and MP I think one month
later<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> first<00:00:19.500> setup<00:00:20.100> box

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
later so this is the first setup box

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.590

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.940 
this is it so how will they compare and
price<00:05:07.760> compared<00:05:08.690> with<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> open<00:05:09.320> air<00:05:09.440> box<00:05:09.620> is

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
price compared with the open air box is

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.310 
price compared with the open air box is
there<00:05:10.730> price<00:05:10.940> retail<00:05:11.480> price<00:05:11.690> for<00:05:11.720> this

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
there price retail price for this

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.410 
there price retail price for this
we're<00:05:13.220> not<00:05:13.370> was<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.640> greater<00:05:13.970> price<00:05:14.180> not

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
we're not was a greater price not

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.470 
we're not was a greater price not
available<00:05:14.900> yet<00:05:14.990> we<00:05:15.500> will<00:05:15.710> maybe<00:05:16.130> have<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.060> in

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
available yet we will maybe have it in

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.290 
available yet we will maybe have it in
already<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.320> next<00:05:18.620> month<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.130> think<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:21.169> will<00:05:21.440> be

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
already of next month I think it will be

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.659 
already of next month I think it will be
the<00:05:23.300> same<00:05:23.600> like<00:05:23.630> ran<00:05:24.169> out<00:05:24.380> richer<00:05:25.130> pass<00:05:25.310> for<00:05:25.520> a

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
the same like ran out richer pass for a

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:26.310 
the same like ran out richer pass for a
winner

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
winner

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.310 
winner
alright<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.520> there<00:05:29.120> we<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.390> quad<00:05:29.750> core<00:05:29.990> ARM

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
alright so there we have a quad core ARM

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.130 
alright so there we have a quad core ARM
Cortex<00:05:30.680> a9<00:05:31.720> hmm<00:05:32.780> all<00:05:33.530> right<00:05:33.740> with<00:05:34.010> good<00:05:34.220> gaming

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
Cortex a9 hmm all right with good gaming

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.880 
Cortex a9 hmm all right with good gaming
support<00:05:36.140> also<00:05:36.290> yes<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.910> PCB<00:05:38.180> is<00:05:38.360> stable

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
support also yes and the PCB is stable

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.800 
support also yes and the PCB is stable
right<00:05:39.890> now<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.880> this<00:05:41.090> is<00:05:41.540> the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
right now you see this is the

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.350 
right now you see this is the
engineering<00:05:42.470> piece<00:05:43.340> VA<00:05:43.550> we<00:05:44.330> will<00:05:44.480> have<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:45.280> PP

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
engineering piece VA we will have the PP

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.870 
engineering piece VA we will have the PP
pilot<00:05:47.360> production<00:05:47.930> in<00:05:48.410> next<00:05:48.710> month<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.100> the
