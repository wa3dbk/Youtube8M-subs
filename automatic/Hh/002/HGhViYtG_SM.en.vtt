00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.750
 Austria's motorway tunnels are among the most modern and safest in Europe. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 The ASFINAG invests a lot of money and relies on state-of-the-art technology. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500
 So that you come safely and relaxed through each tunnel, 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 Here are some tips for you: 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Very important: Before entering, please note the speed limit. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 Take off the sunglasses and turn on the low beam. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.200
 So you drive with the best view and are also clearly visible to others. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
 Close all windows and set the ventilation to circulating air. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500
 Switch to a station with traffic information. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.300
 Important: If the traffic light is red, do not enter the tunnel. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 Always pay attention to the applicable speed limit and sufficient safety distance. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 If you ever have a breakdown in the tunnel, stay calm. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 This is not a problem with the help of ASFINAG employees. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.100
 Drive to the next breakdown bay. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 They are available every 1000 meters. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000
 Then turn on the hazard warning lights. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.900
 The ASFINAG employee in the traffic management center has already recognized the situation 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 and sees you on his screen. Now put on your safety vest 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.000
 and go to the emergency phone. 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000
 Important: Do not use your mobile phone. 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.200
 Press the emergency button. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.000
 Once you are in the breakdown bay, the prescribed maximum speed will automatically be lowered 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.800
 and the safety devices activated. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Via the emergency telephone, you are in direct contact with an ASFINAG employee. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600
 This immediately initiates all further measures. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.100
 Should you ever get stuck in a traffic jam, 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.469
 due to an accident or other emergency, 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.000
 keep calm. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.600
 The traffic management center has already recorded the situation 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 and immediately initiate all measures. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 Stay in the car, leave the tunnel only when prompted. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600
 The traffic light in front of the tunnel automatically switches to red 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.500
 and prevents other cars from entering. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.930
 The ASFINAG employee will give you all the necessary instructions via your radio. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.200
 So make sure that a station with traffic information is switched on. 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.639
 "Attention car drivers! Information of the traffic management center: 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:51.000
 There is an emergency in the tunnel. The traffic is therefore stopped. " 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 When you are asked to leave the car, quickly move to the nearest entrance to an escape route. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.000
 You can safely leave the tunnel via the escape route. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.219
 ASFINAG - arriving safely together
