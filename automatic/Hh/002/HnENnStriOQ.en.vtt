00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.440
 welcome from london iris brahm new lg 3 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.200
 phone have 55 inch screen quad hd 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.929
 screen resolution so 2560 1440 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.780
 pixel very high resolutions and we 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.660
 Of course, the samsung is concrete 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 galaxy 5 4 in hand where we are 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 also a bit flickers us 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.470
 have an amoled screen of something 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.320
 but seems to be lighter at 5.1 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.869
 at 15.52 we have both 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 almost the same size which they say 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 we see is in 10 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.790
 millimeter difference in height and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 Nevertheless, the lg is a lot bigger 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.670
 the age is concerned 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 synonymous with the camera at the once 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 16 once have 13 more pixels but here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 we instead of a live sensor 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 Laser sensor in it for autofocus otherwise 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 both infrared of course as seen here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 can headphones connection with samsung 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 above all Jews and nothing else 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.289
 of course I had the lg 3d functions 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 or not too superfluous but not 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.250
 always practical and therefore ever 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 the camera says the two way 4k 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.810
 can record and I turn 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.060
 now at ours we can be here 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 see that the samsung nx is 34 saves 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 more suitable system of wide angle 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 is much higher from the front pages 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 you can with that over both way 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 we can rotate some full hd videos 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 you can also see the speed 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.460
 Maybe the lg is a tick 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 faster, both relatively slow 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.610
 but here it's just beautiful 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.520
 out of motion and I step 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.690
 both young 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 you look here the backward 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.300
 Camera allegation as I said both 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 can rotate 4k videos and banners 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.520
 are a bit more realistic 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.630
 maybe with the lg but here you can 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 In any case, we already see beautiful 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 that autofocus a little faster 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.820
 may not react to the lg 3 but not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.470
 budget is a picture for everyone 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.500
 fall faster recognize again clearly 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.880
 but the wide angle is back 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.720
 times may be a bit better at 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.580
 But samsung is actually the main thing 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.899
 in the comparison goal we can see 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.970
 the design is what you actually have here too 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.520
 a removable back have the but 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.160
 Made of metal is not just plastic 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.170
 here at samsung and from the weight ago 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 Nevertheless, work the same size 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.710
 also similar and we'll just get it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.750
 much more screen on one lot 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.880
 smaller size you can have shocked 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.720
 Until next time 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.490
 you will learn more details of course 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.040
 our next video to lg their three 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.030
 children have you ever unforgettable 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 youtube stagnate
