it's<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.140> straight<00:00:19.350> piece<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> wire<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
it's a straight piece of wire with a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.820 
it's a straight piece of wire with a
loop<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.029> try<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> buy<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> longest<00:00:22.650> ones

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
loop in it I try to buy the longest ones

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.439 
loop in it I try to buy the longest ones
I<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.640> then<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.029> cut<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.269> down

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I can because then I can cut them down

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.410 
I can because then I can cut them down
to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> size<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.170> need<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.560> reuse<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.099> wire

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
to the size I need and reuse the wire

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.939 
to the size I need and reuse the wire
these<00:00:27.420> are<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.779> some<00:00:27.930> basic<00:00:27.960> wire<00:00:28.500> cutters

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
these are just some basic wire cutters

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
these are just some basic wire cutters
here<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.429> gonna<00:00:29.580> cut<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.510> about

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
here I'm gonna cut it what is that about

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.459 
here I'm gonna cut it what is that about
half<00:00:31.170> inch<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.270> there<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.840> I'm

turn this up here and I'm gonna put a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.619 
turn this up here and I'm gonna put a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
little hook in it now I know that I want

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.470 
little hook in it now I know that I want
this<00:00:46.260> loop<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.980> come<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this loop to come in to the to the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
this loop to come in to the to the
pendant<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.829> direction<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> can

pendant in this direction so that I can

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
pendant in this direction so that I can
attach<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> necklace<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.670> going

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
attach it to the necklace so I'm going

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.840 
attach it to the necklace so I'm going
to<00:00:54.210> take<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> opposite<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> push

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
to take this the opposite way and push

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.799 
to take this the opposite way and push
it<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:58.609> once<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.850> there<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.390> turn

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it right in here once it's there I turn

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.260 
it right in here once it's there I turn
it<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.890> hook<00:01:02.160> isn't<00:01:02.370> firmly<00:01:02.940> embedded

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
it now that hook isn't firmly embedded

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
it now that hook isn't firmly embedded
in<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.350> hold<00:01:04.680> our<00:01:04.949> wire<00:01:05.220> in

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
in there and it's gonna hold our wire in

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.539 
in there and it's gonna hold our wire in
for<00:01:05.970> us<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
here ready to go I'm going to make my

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
here ready to go I'm going to make my
own<00:01:15.479> loop<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.049> time<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.770> gonna<00:01:16.979> grab<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
own loop this time I'm gonna grab the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
own loop this time I'm gonna grab the
end<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.049> pliers<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> gonna

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
end of it with my pliers this is gonna

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
end of it with my pliers this is gonna
make<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> smallest<00:01:20.850> loop<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
make the smallest loop I can here and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.600 
make the smallest loop I can here and
then<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> roll<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.460> towards<00:01:24.240> yourself<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
then you roll it towards yourself and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
then you roll it towards yourself and
that'll<00:01:26.610> create<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:27.090> loop<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> pull<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that'll create your loop you can pull it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
that'll create your loop you can pull it
back<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.729> nice

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
back just a little bit to get it nice

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.770 
back just a little bit to get it nice
and<00:01:30.090> centered<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> all

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and centered there there we go and all

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
and centered there there we go and all
we<00:01:33.900> need<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.530> cut<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:36.979> put<00:01:37.979> our<00:01:38.100> little

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
we need to do is cut that put our little

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.520 
we need to do is cut that put our little
hook<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.859 

I'm<00:01:45.070> using<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.640> pliers<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.090> kind<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.450> flatten

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
I'm using the pliers to kind of flatten

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.469 
I'm using the pliers to kind of flatten
the<00:01:47.020> hope<00:01:47.229> just<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.619> little<00:01:47.860> bit<00:01:47.979> there<00:01:48.479> now

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
the hope just a little bit there now

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.180 
the hope just a little bit there now
once<00:01:49.750> again<00:01:49.900> we<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.740> sit<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.040> same

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
once again we want it to sit the same

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.090 
once again we want it to sit the same
way<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.520> I'm<00:01:54.640> going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> push<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.180> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 

we're<00:02:00.100> gonna<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.490> sit<00:02:00.700> flat<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.270> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
we're gonna have it sit flat like this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.190 
we're gonna have it sit flat like this
there<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:02.770> go<00:02:02.920> now<00:02:03.909> over<00:02:04.390> here<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.600> wanted<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.050> do

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
there we go now over here I wanted to do

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.770 
there we go now over here I wanted to do
these<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.590> double<00:02:05.920> tier<00:02:06.100> earrings<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.509> can

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
these as double tier earrings so you can

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.900 
these as double tier earrings so you can
see<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> wire<00:02:08.830> set<00:02:09.280> up<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.580> have

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
see that I have the wire set up I have

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.059 
see that I have the wire set up I have
the<00:02:10.239> wire<00:02:10.450> here<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.080> hook<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> earring

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the wire here to hook on to the earring

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.190 
the wire here to hook on to the earring
wire<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.670> then<00:02:13.239> these<00:02:13.569> two<00:02:13.900> are<00:02:13.930> gonna

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
wire and then these two are gonna

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.380 
wire and then these two are gonna
connect<00:02:14.680> see<00:02:15.040> how<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.550> flat<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.270> is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
connect see how one is flat and one is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.630 
connect see how one is flat and one is
on<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.080> perpendicular<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.459> so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
on on the perpendicular that's so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.580 
on on the perpendicular that's so
they'll<00:02:18.850> connect<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.330> hang<00:02:19.510> correctly<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
they'll connect and hang correctly and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.840 
they'll connect and hang correctly and
that's<00:02:20.739> why<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.950> said<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.220> had<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.519> think<00:02:21.550> about

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
that's why I said I had to think about

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.490 
that's why I said I had to think about
this<00:02:22.209> because<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.630> want<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> make<00:02:23.080> sure<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
this because I want to make sure that I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.800 
this because I want to make sure that I
embed<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> wire<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.700> correct<00:02:24.970> way<00:02:25.060> once

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
embed the wire in the correct way once

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.540 
embed the wire in the correct way once
these<00:02:26.019> are<00:02:26.080> baked<00:02:26.410> all<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:26.920> need<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
these are baked all I'll need to do is

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
these are baked all I'll need to do is
just<00:02:27.760> open<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.239> one<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.420> these<00:02:28.570> loops<00:02:28.870> hook<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
just open up one of these loops hook the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.020 
just open up one of these loops hook the
other<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:29.769> in<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.190> close<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> loop<00:02:30.790> and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
other one in it and close the loop and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.509 
other one in it and close the loop and
we'll<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.600> all<00:02:31.720> set<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.050> go<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.500> those<00:02:32.709> now<00:02:33.340> how

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
we'll be all set to go on those now how

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.120 
we'll be all set to go on those now how
do<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.670> attach<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:35.050> earrings<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.890> ear

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
do we attach the earrings to the ear

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.160 
do we attach the earrings to the ear
wire<00:02:36.400> well<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.150> know<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.390> little<00:02:37.630> loop<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
wire well you know the little loop that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.259 
wire well you know the little loop that
we<00:02:38.319> put<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:38.950> all<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.670> need<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.970> do<00:02:40.120> is

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
we put in here all you need to do is

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.690 
we put in here all you need to do is
open<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.840> loop<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.800> your<00:02:42.040> needlenose

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
open that loop up with your needlenose

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.640 
open that loop up with your needlenose
pliers<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:44.670> put<00:02:45.670> your<00:02:45.970> ear<00:02:46.209> wire<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.720> make

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
pliers and put your ear wire in make

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.020 
pliers and put your ear wire in make
sure<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.069> put<00:02:48.220> your<00:02:48.340> ear<00:02:48.430> wire<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
sure that you put your ear wire in the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.060 
sure that you put your ear wire in the
right<00:02:49.180> way<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.780> always<00:02:50.410> tend<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.739> do<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
right way I always tend to do it the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.490 
right way I always tend to do it the
wrong<00:02:51.220> way<00:02:51.280> every<00:02:52.030> single<00:02:52.209> time<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.930> then

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
wrong way every single time and then

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.830 
wrong way every single time and then
close<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.980> loop<00:02:54.160> back<00:02:54.430> up<00:02:54.459> if<00:02:55.299> you're<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.750> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
close the loop back up if you're in a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.490 
close the loop back up if you're in a
pinch<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:58.060> also<00:02:58.360> open<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> loop<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
pinch you can also open the loop on the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
pinch you can also open the loop on the
ear<00:02:59.680> wire<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.310> connect<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:01.780> all

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
ear wire to connect it and you're all

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.550 
ear wire to connect it and you're all
set

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
set

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.460 
set
you<00:03:02.890> see<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.250> pair<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> double<00:03:04.269> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you see this pair is a double I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.170 
you see this pair is a double I
disconnected<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.620> two<00:03:05.799> wires<00:03:06.070> together<00:03:06.489> here

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
disconnected the two wires together here

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.380 
disconnected the two wires together here
and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:08.530> added<00:03:09.190> my<00:03:09.310> ear<00:03:09.519> wire<00:03:09.730> up<00:03:10.030> here<00:03:10.299> at

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and then added my ear wire up here at

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.449 
and then added my ear wire up here at
the<00:03:10.480> top<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.380> can<00:03:11.620> see<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.280> just

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the top so you can see that I can just

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.759 
the top so you can see that I can just
open<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.090> these<00:03:13.209> up<00:03:14.430> maybe<00:03:16.320> there<00:03:17.320> we<00:03:17.410> go

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
open one of these up maybe there we go

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.250 
open one of these up maybe there we go
see<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:18.970> put<00:03:19.359> it<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.570> there<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.930> close

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
see and I just put it in there and close

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.300 
see and I just put it in there and close
the<00:03:20.890> loop<00:03:21.070> again<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:23.410> all<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.859> need<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.160> do

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
the loop again that's all you need to do

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.640 
the loop again that's all you need to do
I<00:03:24.549> would<00:03:25.180> also<00:03:25.329> advise<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.200> double

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
I would also advise that you double

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.110 
I would also advise that you double
check<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.010> make<00:03:27.040> sure<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.519> all<00:03:27.700> your<00:03:27.730> wires

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
check to make sure that all your wires

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.680 
check to make sure that all your wires
are<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.600> real<00:03:28.900> tight<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.730> got<00:03:30.910> lazy<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.510> I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
are in real tight if you got lazy like I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.060 
are in real tight if you got lazy like I
did<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.140> probably<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.500> stuck<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.920> wire

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
did and probably just stuck the wire

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.800 
did and probably just stuck the wire
Aryan<00:03:33.400> without<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.820> little<00:03:34.060> hook<00:03:34.239> you're

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
Aryan without the little hook you're

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.210 
Aryan without the little hook you're
probably<00:03:35.049> gonna<00:03:35.290> need<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.620> pull<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.950> out<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
probably gonna need to pull it out and
