 block because I turned off the focus is only 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.120
 this heat here plus the oven will be the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.950
 enough for us to get the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.239
 block on a legal point without 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.900
 dark block 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:06.070

 cool point 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:17.940
 It's just missing and then we'll talk here a good 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.940
 parmesan amount 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.860
 there is a good amount per injury because 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.740
 besides entering 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.150
 the wonderful taste of parmesan it 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.620
 helps to give the organization in this 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.620
 block stuffing 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.040
 now I'll just wait to cool down to 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.260
 stuff while it happens 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.020

 It's tasty there, we just need to stuff it. 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.370
 cursing this one is a little creamier 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.370
 no, this is too much 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.239
 So it's good and here is the one that we 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.970
 also opened on hand and have put it here 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.970
 on top it hits the edge here 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.610
 for the top part to stick in the dough that 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.660
 was already there and this is pushing 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.660
 down and cutting the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.840
 finish here today with your hand 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:55.630
 so let's beat the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.850
 care not to spill the egg in the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.560
 edged here because if you see the mother in the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.400
 border will change it will work 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.400
 sharing the then more picelli in the middle 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.520
 without dripping 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.900
 this goes to the preheated oven 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.940
 180 degrees 30 to 35 minutes to give 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.310
 finishing 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.410
 we let it not be then 30 35 minutes 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.750
