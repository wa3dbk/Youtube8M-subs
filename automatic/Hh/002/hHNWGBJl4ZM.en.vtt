pieces on the back
they're<00:03:50.510> too<00:03:50.750> long<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.590> piece<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.310> coming

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
they're too long the piece is coming

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.860 
they're too long the piece is coming
twelve<00:03:53.000> feet<00:03:53.210> long<00:03:53.920> length<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.490> you<00:03:55.790> end<00:03:56.750> up

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
twelve feet long length so you end up

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.750 
twelve feet long length so you end up
with<00:03:56.990> all<00:03:57.110> this<00:03:57.230> waste<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.400> we're<00:03:58.670> probably

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
with all this waste so we're probably

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.210 
with all this waste so we're probably
going<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.090> use<00:03:59.150> two<00:03:59.570> of<00:03:59.600> them<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.830> make<00:04:00.950> one

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
going to use two of them to make one

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.070 
going to use two of them to make one
batten<00:04:01.700> on<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> back<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.300> house<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.780> don't

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
batten on the back of the house I don't

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.110 
batten on the back of the house I don't
think<00:04:03.290> anybody<00:04:03.650> will<00:04:03.770> ever<00:04:03.890> notice<00:04:04.220> it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.369 

we<00:04:08.120> probably<00:04:08.359> I'll<00:04:08.629> just<00:04:08.900> leave<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.140> little

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
we probably I'll just leave a little

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.180 
we probably I'll just leave a little
joint<00:04:10.299> between<00:04:11.299> them<00:04:12.310> we<00:04:13.310> can<00:04:13.459> put<00:04:13.639> coffee<00:04:13.879> in

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
joint between them we can put coffee in

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.420 
joint between them we can put coffee in
there

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
there

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.909 
there
spins<00:04:16.759> it<00:04:16.910> out<00:04:23.110> there<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.349> south<00:04:24.590> side

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
spins it out there on the south side

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.770 
spins it out there on the south side
today

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.330 

we<00:04:29.780> used<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.110> use<00:04:30.169> pump<00:04:30.560> jacks<00:04:32.919> Paco<00:04:33.919> how<00:04:34.160> come

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
we used to use pump jacks Paco how come

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.040 
we used to use pump jacks Paco how come
y'all<00:04:34.550> are<00:04:34.669> like<00:04:34.789> pump<00:04:35.090> jacks<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:36.880> don't<00:04:37.880> have

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
y'all are like pump jacks I don't have

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.420 
y'all are like pump jacks I don't have
I've<00:04:39.050> got<00:04:39.289> some<00:04:39.560> somewhere<00:04:42.070> they're<00:04:43.070> kind<00:04:43.370> of

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
I've got some somewhere they're kind of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
I've got some somewhere they're kind of
a<00:04:43.490> pain<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:43.729> set<00:04:44.090> up<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.449> have<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.780> admit<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.289> I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
a pain to set up I have to admit and I

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.080 
a pain to set up I have to admit and I
don't<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:46.039> when<00:04:46.190> people<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:46.639> nail<00:04:46.880> them

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
don't like it when people just nail them

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.820 
don't like it when people just nail them
on<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.270> top<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.720> shingles<00:04:48.139> up<00:04:48.259> there<00:04:48.500> yeah

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
on the top of the shingles up there yeah

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.800 
on the top of the shingles up there yeah
it's<00:04:49.669> that's<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.240> only<00:04:50.389> thing<00:04:50.509> I<00:04:50.599> don't<00:04:50.690> like

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
it's that's the only thing I don't like

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.170 
it's that's the only thing I don't like
but<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> think<00:04:52.220> they're<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.400> little<00:04:52.490> bit<00:04:52.729> safer

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
but I think they're a little bit safer

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.450 
but I think they're a little bit safer
than<00:04:53.330> this

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
than this

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:12.700 
than this
but<00:04:58.660> y'all<00:04:59.660> are<00:04:59.810> pretty<00:04:59.990> safe<00:05:01.090> guys

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:57.879 

it's<00:05:13.160> coming<00:05:13.430> along<00:05:13.490> pretty<00:05:13.610> good

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.539
