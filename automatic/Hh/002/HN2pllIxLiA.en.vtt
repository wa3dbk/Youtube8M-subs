00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that we made ourselves proud and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
that we made ourselves proud and
hopefully<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.360> made<00:01:39.509> everybody<00:01:39.869> else<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
hopefully we made everybody else are you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440 
hopefully we made everybody else are you
mad<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.220> came<00:01:41.400> down<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.850> penalty<00:01:42.270> kick

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
mad that it came down to a penalty kick

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.499 
mad that it came down to a penalty kick
maybe<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:43.049> ask<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> hope<00:01:44.210> about<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
maybe I should ask you hope about that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
maybe I should ask you hope about that
because<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> mean<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> guys<00:01:46.680> played<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.130> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
because I mean you guys played with so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
because I mean you guys played with so
much<00:01:47.549> hard<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
much hard and this is the thing that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
much hard and this is the thing that
they<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.290> watched<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.820> penalty<00:01:51.180> kicks

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they had watched you do penalty kicks

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.899 
they had watched you do penalty kicks
you<00:01:51.540> had<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.869> seen<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.920> penalty<00:01:53.280> kicks<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you had not seen them do penalty kicks I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.060 
you had not seen them do penalty kicks I
think<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.689> major<00:01:54.930> tournament<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
think in a major tournament it is so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.090 
think in a major tournament it is so
difficult<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.790> win<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:58.320> dramatic<00:01:58.860> games

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
difficult to win two very dramatic games

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.399 
difficult to win two very dramatic games
in<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> fashion<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> came

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
in that kind of fashion so when it came

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.840 
in that kind of fashion so when it came
down<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> penalty<00:02:02.009> kicks<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.490> had<00:02:02.579> given

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
down to penalty kicks we had given

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.639 
down to penalty kicks we had given
everything<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.509> had<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> last<00:02:04.170> penalty

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
everything we had in the last penalty

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800 
everything we had in the last penalty
kick<00:02:04.799> shootout<00:02:04.829> against<00:02:05.520> Brazil<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> knew

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
kick shootout against Brazil so I knew

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.999 
kick shootout against Brazil so I knew
it<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.020> gonna<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.290> difficult<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.829> time

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it was gonna be difficult this time

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.620 
it was gonna be difficult this time
around

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
around

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.240 
around
but<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.930> know<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.230> gave<00:02:10.410> our<00:02:10.590> best<00:02:10.620> game<00:02:11.100> in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
but you know we gave our best game in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.130 
but you know we gave our best game in
the<00:02:11.340> final<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> possession<00:02:12.480> oriented

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the final it was a possession oriented

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
the final it was a possession oriented
game<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.400> long<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.730> had<00:02:14.820> heard<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
game and for so long we had heard you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.390 
game and for so long we had heard you
know<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.810> American<00:02:16.230> team<00:02:16.440> has<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> great

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
know this the American team has a great

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400 
know this the American team has a great
defense<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.210> they<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.510> long<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.260> for

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
defense but they go long they look for

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.490 
defense but they go long they look for
Abby's<00:02:19.680> head<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.850> final<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.990> came<00:02:22.290> out

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
Abby's head but in the final we came out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
Abby's head but in the final we came out
with<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:23.100> attacking<00:02:23.520> spirit<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.540> think<00:02:24.780> we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
with an attacking spirit and I think we

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.110 
with an attacking spirit and I think we
showed<00:02:25.460> America<00:02:26.460> everything<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.000> they

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
showed America everything that they

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
showed America everything that they
finally<00:02:27.300> wanted<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.020> final<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.980> hard

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
finally wanted to see in a final as hard

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.280 
finally wanted to see in a final as hard
as<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.700> loss<00:02:29.940> was<00:02:30.270> for<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:30.870> saw<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.170> his

so good and I think that that's the
thing<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.280> we're<00:03:14.490> taking<00:03:14.820> away<00:03:14.940> from<00:03:15.060> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
thing that we're taking away from it

for<00:03:41.700> women's<00:03:42.060> sports<00:03:43.880> absolutely<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> think

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
for women's sports absolutely I think

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.680 
for women's sports absolutely I think
it's<00:03:45.330> it's<00:03:45.840> clear<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:47.760> know<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.090> play

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
it's it's clear that you know we play

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.510 
it's it's clear that you know we play

and<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:50.730> much<00:03:50.880> passion<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.510> think<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
and so much passion I think that's the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.180 
and so much passion I think that's the
American<00:03:52.260> spirit<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.860> think<00:03:53.070> people

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
American spirit and I think people

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.580 
American spirit and I think people
really<00:03:53.600> grasped<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.500> they

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
really grasped on to that and they

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.200 
really grasped on to that and they
wanted<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.890> jump<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.460> the<00:03:56.550> bandwagon<00:03:56.760> and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
wanted to jump on the bandwagon and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.690 
wanted to jump on the bandwagon and
