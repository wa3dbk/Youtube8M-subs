00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.009
 hello and welcome 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.680
 My name is because today there is one 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.930
 new top five but before that I have something 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.539
 said that I will do and that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.869
 huge now a little song in the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.320
 quarter rex and all my ducks 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.930
 swim on the lake swim on the lake 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.350
 see and today there are the top 5 of the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.360
 New Vahr lay that was now 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.680
 Bit wrong but definitely have 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.879
 the whole time again on facebook 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.159
 tuned and you have neat 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.820
 I really liked that 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:54.559
 and let's start with the number directly 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 five on number 5 we have the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 Strom falls from the giant and that 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.769
 at the thomson I'm scary that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 this fall into the ranking 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.150
 because i think many will be this 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.299
 trap with the tactics associated with 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.690
 the thought as they tuned 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.940
 to have 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.760
 and yes it is not quite nice the fall 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 costs 1000 points and is really 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.300
 really a very good trap for many 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.580
 many tactics 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.070
 I think I'll be one in the background 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:29.270
 tactics of running it and here 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:32.090
 we come to number four on the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 Number four we have the fan 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.420
 fall from web of the dead I'm mine 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
 not even sure if you have the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.530
 fan trap is called or if you call it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.780
 Knife fall and no idea 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.850
 In any case, I will do it now 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.270
 a 6 second cliff background 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.310
 pack 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.310
 and yes I 'm short 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.900
 As you could see is this clip 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.210
 Pretty funny you can fall this trap 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.970
 very good use for pain before 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 all pain like you just good 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.520
 could see 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.770
 Of course you can do the fall too 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:15.050
 use to pay people 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.870
 and yes, commercial number three on the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.860
 third place we have a black ops 1 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.140
 map and although chino number two china 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.940
 yes there is this trap in the middle of the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.580
 card i just got it ! 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 has three dingsbums in the end 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.350
 it then explained to me my subscribers 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.130
 that it's easy to say exactly how 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.810
 blogger and yes I think the trap is 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.959
 me very horny full I use them 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.330
 myself very much and yes it costs 750 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.040
 points that's a big one 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.010
 difference between the others fall 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.920
 because otherwise no one else no 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.680
 third exactly no other trap 750 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.180
 points cost except this trap and that 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.220
 I think she is so cheap 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 and that you get them back so fast 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 can use number two on the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 second place we even have mine 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.799
 favorite trap and that is the children of 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.480
 dead fire trap i'm wondering that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.760
 you have chosen this trap because it is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.549
 really really one really 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.519
 Horny loss and I just celebrate it 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.420
 to play with this and yes she can 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.530
 you in the reception room if you go left 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.250
 Enable So I have now completely 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.079
 funny explained 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.420
 In any case, if you are rome in the beginning 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.010
 just go straight to the left then 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.780
 open the door and then the case 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.670
 then you can activate with this 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.280
 trap it there is a very complete 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.200
 simple tactics with this trap and 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.030
 that's why you think so too 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.340
 fall elected I find very horny 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.340
 and off to number 1 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.010
 in the first place we have a map 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.329
 of the dead fall again and that 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.730
 the acid trap 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.980
 Well, I have to say that in black ops 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.439
 2, there are not many fall 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.299
 But then there's just a card 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.250
 two pieces and this even in the ranking 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.849
 landed for me super cool 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.010
 Either way, so respect us so 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.479
 Acid trap is also one of mine 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.289
 favorite fall because you are with you 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.789
 just so beautiful can just be so beautiful 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:25.090
 because no idea there are so many 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.410
 tactics with this trap and yes me 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.060
 actually do not need anything anymore 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.090
 say it's a cool trap it does 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.800
 fun to play with her and that was it 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.150
 also with the top 5 and that I am 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.729
 at the beginning I sang that is for 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.190
 the dear right and yes I am one 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.830
 a little tired because I've been there 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.860
 beaten do not let me lie 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.800
 I'm about 14 hours awake because I am 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.349
 just have to go through the night because or 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.560
 because I have to go through the whole day 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.300
 just on monday again school and there 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.949
 My sleep rhythm is so in the ass 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.699
 that I am actually at 10 o'clock 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.010
 go to sleep and then at 18 o'clock 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.870
 get up that brings me but I have to 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.060
 in proper sleep we land 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.590

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.659
 This video is not so good this time 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.479
 If you like this one well 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.880
 tempered but previously destroyed dennis 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.130

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.849
