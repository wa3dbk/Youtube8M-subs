00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.640
 So let's try to test both from the mod 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.520
 here is this metal cleaning cream 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.150
 surfaces faberlic our kitchen 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.650
 I already put a sink on a sponge and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.650
 now try 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 like I think this cream is logical 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:47.829
 if he also removes tartar 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:54.269
 water that is not just dirt on exactly 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:59.049
 limescale is a tap for a filter 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:09.479
 matilda lies helps me 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:09.479
 helps rests shoot not made up 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:26.350
 Carlson and the instructions say that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.240
 it takes a few minutes and then 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.679
 just a little rub and rinse with water and so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.649
 start flushing 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.340
 I have rubbed the surface and now flush 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.340
 some water 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.780
 Well, I washed away the money and now 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 I rub a sink with an ordinary towel 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:00.700
 to make the effect more obvious 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.530
 basically cancer but ok he 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.840
 accrued despite the fact that they are 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 some abrasive particles this is exactly 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.040
 Cream Well , you see, the tap is also quite 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.670
 myself so brilliant and not sharp there 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.910
 effect 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.720
 that he is him or two hundred years old he is all in 0 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.959
 purge 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.989
 not right there is super mega perfect but in 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.530
 in general, I like the sink looks 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.580
 very clean for cleaning 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.800
 sinks in the tub and i will use 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 just such a piece of detergent in 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.720
 bathroom 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.570
 I will try obviously also very liquid, usually I 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.300
 powder brush all such special 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.269
 ceramic and porcelain 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.910
 faience surface unscrew cap 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.739
 this whole thing is that he 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.230
 turns and pretends that she doesn't 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.790
 I understand what you want from him here I am 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.120
 getting turning 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.940
 and crush verbalnaya hands nifiga tusur 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 Everything is already some kind of why on 2 does the eye 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.739
 distressed all one way he is not 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.230
 rotates at closing 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 that is, he reached the maximum of all a 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.810
 exactly the opening here and go wash 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.560
 all horror hangs I still his 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:25.709
 won and pour it on a sponge 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:31.980
 means get such a thick foam 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:35.709
 which I grease and tap and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.650
 immediate mole of course that's all 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.310
 I moved these things and then 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.710
 rinse is not so easy chums clean 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:53.790
 it's a few minutes 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:58.920
 and wash off the funds as you can see shells 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.910
 washed off well faucet looks great 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.480
 and drain to wipe dry 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:11.700
 Here are just like from the store, I also 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.340
 smeared with this tool bath said as 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.460
 You see, too, perfectly washed off despite 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.050
 the fact that she is creamy is so creepy 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:25.290
 there are not even any abrasive particles 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:31.580
 but at the same time it looks like the same 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.580
 but the century so here looks like a bath 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.280
 and the last thing I want to show you 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:59.370
 this means for cleaning of plates and ovens 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.310
 our stove gets dirty very quickly not 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:07.020
 I know about a couple of days and see everything 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:11.240
 such things are reflected here we try 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.699
 wash our tiles with this tool 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.039
 it also opens difficult that is 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.819
 you twist it and not twist 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:27.479
 absolutely on the spot cool pour 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:35.490
 a little money on the sponge and wet 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:38.250
 sponge start to put on the plate and so 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.180
 a few minutes passed and I actively work 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.180
 polluted places 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.160
 the foam I'm taking away the sponge because it 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.360
 a very long time and will be here such here 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.360
 ordinary cloth 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.850
 gather for the first time then I did 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.940
 rinse and do it myself the second time 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.840
 after I removed the foam take dry 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.480
 rag and wipe our want to say 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.490
 there was some shy 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:28.380
 Pukhova left some strange 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:31.110
 feathers are not critical you can see that the plate 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.120
 began to look much better but in some places 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:38.040
 all the same these traces remained 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.720
 that is, do not say that it is straight cleared 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.720
 everything is super mega perfect 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.020
 You see, what is Greece from us? 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:56.450
 In general, all the same plate in principle 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:59.100
 it looks clean where there is something else 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.910
 try to modify the rest of you 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.850
 special cloth cooker 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.960
 she has such an interesting structure which 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:12.740
 sort of like should cleanse such on the mountain 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:19.220
 she is so big I wet the edge 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.220
 clarify the middle and try and rub 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:30.470
 That seems to be rubbed and dry edge 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:38.210
 Here it is so wet 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:40.310
 dry here's what we got the stove in 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.479
 principle, normally washed off a little 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.960
 looking dry but looking generally 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.960
 decently 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.449
 I hope I charged you with desire 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:58.930
