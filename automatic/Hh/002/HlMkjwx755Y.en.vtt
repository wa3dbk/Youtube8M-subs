00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.920
 I donâ€™t dare to take time to make faces 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.990
 those who watch what news only 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.680
 for their sake, so here you are right in the face 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.119
 gentlemen, well everyone can be free 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.770
 go comment and we 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.050
 go to 0 and nvidia officially 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.730
 introduced a gaming tablet and nvidia 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.040
 shield not to confuse the gadget with 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.500
 the ancestor of the shield family complete 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.570
 The name sounds the same and nvidia shield 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.030
 respectively, the console is announced in 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.590
 January 2013 is now called and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.750
 nvidia shield portable 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.880
 such things so with naming we figured out 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.740
 what about the gadget itself is powerful 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.120
 8-inch android tablet sharpened 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.130
 under the game is built on the base 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.050
 quad processor tegra k1 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.760
 the strength of which manufacturer 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.610
 calls not really cool graphics 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.920
 Already 192 food can be played in a completely 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.199
 Any games for android + are specially 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.880
 noise- optimized fun also 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.920
 on the tablet you can stream compatible 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.659
 games directly from computers only 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.610
 the condition that the PC had graphics 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.560
 family and nvidia geforce gtx 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.330
 Americans are more fortunate than others 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.790
 and they can stream games in general right 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.980
 from the cloud the service is called and seeing the grid 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.380
 2 does not work in beta mode and is available 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.180
 so far only in the USA is also native 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.130
 support streaming gameplay in 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.170
 twitch well and console mode when 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.909
 The tablet is used as a command post. 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.159
 and all the most colorful exciting 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.570
 happening on the big you on the screen very 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.000
 convenient for team games with friends 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.290
 for example or to watch movies in 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.880
 complete with tablet comes 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.280
 some fancy stylus give 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.560
 stylus 2 is true why do they need gamers and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.180
 It is not clear but the artist is useful but 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 really necessary thing wireless 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 shield controller not included 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.909
 will have to buy more and make it extremely 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.190
 is desirable because the controller of 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.810
 is it worth you interface site direct and 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.350
 audio jacks own touchpad and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.650
 voice control costs controller 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 3500 rubles 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.540
 the tablet will cost 14 or 19 thousand 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.790
 rubles that supports more expensive lte 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.060
 in Russia, gadgets will appear in the middle 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.060
 September 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.030
 meanwhile apple talked about 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.770
 third quarter financial results 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.060
 earned 37 and a half billion 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.920
 dollars of which are seven and seven 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.110
 billion is net profit 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.490
 both figures turned out and higher than in 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.560
 last year thanks in large part to 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.780
 great sales of iPhones to which 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.490
 accounted for more than half of all income 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.300
 managed to sell over 35 million 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.000
 devices 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.580
 which is 4 million more than in 2013 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 sales of ipods burn down 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.080
 rates dropped by as much as 36 percent 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.390
 no wonder here but the fall 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.740
 iPads trend unexpected amount 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.140
 sold tablets decreased from 14.6 to 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.390
 13.3 million nevertheless tim cook 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.670
 stated that these are not things that can 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.750
 bother and believe that the indicators still have 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.880
 fibers soar 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.130
 after the partnership is connected will give 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.330
 your first under recall last 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.430
 week I was announced to be concluded 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.110
 partnership agreement with both for 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.160
 promoting cupertin products in 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.230
 corporate sector 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.030
 now after the release of the report 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.010
 partnership story no longer seems 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.870
 so mysterious investors news 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.030
 perceived ambiguously the report of the company 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.160
 left after the close of the United States 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.740
 but at the additional auction shares had 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.570
 cheaper by 0.6 percent and not 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.520
 rise significantly already on the following 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.350
 bidding however no serious 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.810
 changes in the dynamics of communication prices, taking into account 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.580
 did not happen within the conference call a 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.500
 on which the report was published besides 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.230
 figures it turned out a number of other interesting 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 things for example did you know that aytyuns is 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.330
 the fastest growing business of the company 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 or here's 138 billion apple 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.810
 keeps outside the usa jains say 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.810
 where exactly and who has the key 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.730
 this week the president of russian 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.769
 federation Vladimir Putin signed the law 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.480
 prohibiting to send and son with advertising 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.549
 nature without an agreement with the operator and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.560
 appropriate permission from subscribers 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.909
 according to this law whose subscriber 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.799
 floods and sms spam maybe 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.569
 complain to your operator after which 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.430
 sending messages should block 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.319
 how exactly does the disposal process 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.389
 from the annoying message we learned in 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.250
 the press service of the biline turned out that 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.989
 the operator has already offered for half a year 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.760
 the ability to unsubscribe from unwanted 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.829
 mailings through a special short 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.410
 number to complain about spammers 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.209
 You need to send sms to number 007 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.520
 which indicate the number from which you 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.889
 unwanted sms texts came sms and 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.710
 date of receipt can also contact 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.479
 call center at 06 11 all cases 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.099
 complaints are carefully considered after 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.050
 what the subscriber is guaranteed to receive 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.669
 feedback also beeline told 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.440
 that fights illegal spam 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.180
 newsletters on their own initiative 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.680
 not so long ago commissioned 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.900
 special intelligent algorithm 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.830
 which helps to monitor the array 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.110
 data inside the network 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.800
 detects mass mailings and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.800
 block them 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.350
 that same ericsson swedish continues 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.120
 your experiments in the field of internet of things 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.490
 the company presented an interesting 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 connect development from type is special 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.300
 printing technology that allows 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.610
 implant these sensors into ordinary paper 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.050
 sheet touching such a sensor by hand 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.090
 user gets certain 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 data on the smartphone is clamped in the other hand 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.199
 and it all works at the expense of the natural 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.880
 electrical conductivity of the human body 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.560
 for example by touching a certain 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.330
 pictures in a magazine or to the price tag in 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.190
 store user gets to the screen 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.590
 mobile special promotion conditions or 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.910
 any other additional information 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.440
 developers recognize that while all this 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.780
 the story cannot boast of any 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.729
 high performance but she 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.500
 inexpensive to manufacture perfectly 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.500
 safe and damn perspective 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.130
 Facebook appeared safe function with 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.289
 which can be put off 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.020
 then interesting materials from the news 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.880
 tapes of your friends are kind of content and it doesn't matter 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.159
 user's personal treasure 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.470
 You can drag her photos and videos and 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.389
 texts material with default 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.099
 the saved list is not visible to anyone except 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.110
 user at any time you can 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.789
 back to saved records as 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.280
 Facebook mobile clients and bad 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.630
 versions of this steel city facebook itself will 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.490
 remind me from time to time 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.050
 saved good so forget about 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.970
 interesting material set aside for 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.009
 the best of times is not likely to succeed 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.719
 this would seem to take a new feature 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.820
 the online community has taken with 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.860
 great enthusiasm pieces something useful 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.840
 earlier so as not to lose an interesting post 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.940
 I had to either share it 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.159
 remember anyone saw a notebook 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.199
 bring in general everything is interesting and necessary 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.180
 the thing was lost now everything is simple 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.460
 a couple of clicks and all the beauty in one place 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.139
 the safe function already works for everyone 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.180
 mobile devices including in 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.039
 Russia and here in a computer browser 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.930
 there is not yet all on it 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.940
 today all hardened news of the world 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.039
 high tech follow differently 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.500
 site in our social networks and bouquets 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.710
 this until next Friday until the seals 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.710
 until
