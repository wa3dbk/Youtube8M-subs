00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
try to cut the angle between him between

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the ball and the goal so for example if

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.470 
the ball and the goal so for example if
your<00:01:00.780> work<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> left<00:01:02.280> side<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
your work here on the left side and the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
your work here on the left side and the
ball<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.899> intercepted<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.460> brace

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
ball was intercepted here and the brace

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.359 
ball was intercepted here and the brace
the<00:01:06.450> break<00:01:06.689> starts<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.710> flank<00:01:07.979> here

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the break starts on the right flank here

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120 
the break starts on the right flank here
so<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.110> cut<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> angle

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
so what do you do is you cut the angle

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.179 
so what do you do is you cut the angle
here<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> side<00:01:12.450> even<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.560> player<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
here to that side even if this player is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
here to that side even if this player is
going<00:01:14.520> wide<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.210> completely<00:01:15.869> free<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> you've

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
going wide and completely free so you've

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.710 
going wide and completely free so you've
never<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:20.009> able<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.720> cover

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
never going to be able to cover

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
never going to be able to cover
completely<00:01:22.560> both<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> players<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.270> just

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
completely both of the players it's just

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050 
completely both of the players it's just
physically<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.229> possible<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.520> what<00:01:26.759> he<00:01:26.850> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
physically not possible but what he have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.289 
physically not possible but what he have
to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> first<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.250> got<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> angle

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to do is first of all you got the angle

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
to do is first of all you got the angle
for<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> shooter<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> potential

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
for the shooter for the potential

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.950 
for the shooter for the potential
shooter<00:01:32.549> who's<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> ball<00:01:34.229> and

shooter who's the one with the ball and
if<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> keeper<00:01:37.380> knows<00:01:38.159> his<00:01:38.970> job<00:01:39.000> well<00:01:39.540> does

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
if the keeper knows his job well does

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
if the keeper knows his job well does
his<00:01:40.170> job<00:01:40.200> well<00:01:40.619> he<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.520> blow<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.270> cover

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
his job well he will blow he will cover

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.749 
his job well he will blow he will cover
the<00:01:43.850> closest<00:01:44.850> corner<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> goal<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the closest corner of the goal so you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
the closest corner of the goal so you
know<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> cover

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
know that and you still have to cover

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.770 
know that and you still have to cover
the<00:01:52.290> closest<00:01:54.020> corner<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> goal<00:01:55.470> too<00:01:55.740> but

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
the closest corner of the goal too but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
the closest corner of the goal too but
what<00:01:57.780> he<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.040> there's<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.850> little

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
what he can do is this there's a little

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
what he can do is this there's a little
trick<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.950> help<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:03.530> intercept<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
trick that can help you to intercept the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.589 
trick that can help you to intercept the
possible<00:02:05.600> pass<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> player<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.239> blow

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
possible pass to this player so you blow

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.790 
possible pass to this player so you blow
a<00:02:09.629> short

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a short

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
a short
and<00:02:11.210> you<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:14.160> small<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> half<00:02:16.020> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and you make just small just a half a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.600 
and you make just small just a half a
step<00:02:16.410> too<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.240> side<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.460> do

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
step too to this side so what you do

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.600 
step too to this side so what you do
practically<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.660> let<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.550> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
practically is you let a little bit of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.980 
practically is you let a little bit of
space<00:02:23.970> free<00:02:24.960> here<00:02:25.460> for<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> shooter<00:02:26.990> but

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
space free here for the shooter but

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.250 
space free here for the shooter but
you're<00:02:28.950> still<00:02:31.190> making<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:33.240> space<00:02:33.600> here<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you're still making this space here the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.250 
you're still making this space here the
space<00:02:35.100> for<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.490> bus<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:36.060> little<00:02:36.570> smaller<00:02:36.990> for

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
space for the bus a little smaller for

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.310 
space for the bus a little smaller for
him<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> player<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.450> ball<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
him so for the player with the ball so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.310 
him so for the player with the ball so
it<00:02:40.470> makes<00:02:40.710> him<00:02:41.010> hesitate<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.050> more

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it makes him hesitate a little bit more

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.520 
it makes him hesitate a little bit more
what<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.940> shoot<00:02:45.180> or<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.570> pass<00:02:45.810> because

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
what to do to shoot or to pass because

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.010 
what to do to shoot or to pass because
to<00:02:47.190> shoot<00:02:47.460> he<00:02:47.760> has<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.210> little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.690> space

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
to shoot he has a little bit of space

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.860 
to shoot he has a little bit of space
but<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.740> enough<00:02:50.060> he<00:02:51.060> has<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.420> pass<00:02:51.660> he

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
but it's not enough he has to pass he

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.840 
but it's not enough he has to pass he
has<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.260> little<00:02:52.410> bit<00:02:52.590> more<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:53.070> space<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
has a little bit more of space but it's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.060 
has a little bit more of space but it's
not<00:02:54.030> enough<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.810> he<00:02:55.110> has<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.620> think

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
not enough to so he has to do to think

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.990 
not enough to so he has to do to think
and<00:02:56.850> what<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.660> after<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:59.000> you

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
and what you have to do after that you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.740 
and what you have to do after that you
should<00:03:00.800> only<00:03:01.800> concentrate<00:03:02.550> your<00:03:03.120> eyes<00:03:03.360> on<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
should only concentrate your eyes on the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.880 
should only concentrate your eyes on the
ball<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.460> try<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.520> guess<00:03:07.220> which<00:03:08.220> way<00:03:09.890> what

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
ball and try to guess which way what

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.220 
ball and try to guess which way what
option<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.030> player<00:03:12.270> was<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> ball<00:03:12.720> will<00:03:12.930> choose

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
option the player was a ball will choose

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.370 
option the player was a ball will choose
and<00:03:13.670> if<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.000> bus<00:03:15.239> hopefully<00:03:16.140> you'll<00:03:16.350> be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
and if it's a bus hopefully you'll be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.910 
and if it's a bus hopefully you'll be
able<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:17.040> stretch<00:03:17.790> your<00:03:18.000> leg<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.739> walk<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
able to stretch your leg and walk the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.810 
able to stretch your leg and walk the
path<00:03:20.209> if<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.600> shot<00:03:21.870> then<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:23.400> make<00:03:23.640> this

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
path if it's a shot then you make this

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.380 
path if it's a shot then you make this
small<00:03:24.150> movement<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.020> side<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:27.209> blow

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
small movement to this side and you blow

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.560 
small movement to this side and you blow
the<00:03:27.570> shot<00:03:28.220> yes<00:03:29.220> you're<00:03:29.520> gonna<00:03:29.670> need<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> little

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
the shot yes you're gonna need a little

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.960 
the shot yes you're gonna need a little
bit<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.930> luck<00:03:31.140> too<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:31.980> situation

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
bit of luck too in this situation

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.420 
bit of luck too in this situation
certainly<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.780> because<00:03:34.230> you'll<00:03:34.920> want<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.250> get

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
certainly but because you'll want to get

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.280 
certainly but because you'll want to get
against<00:03:36.060> two<00:03:36.239> strikers<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:40.260> a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
against two strikers and this is not a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.160 
against two strikers and this is not a
good<00:03:40.590> situation<00:03:40.830> for<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.520> as<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> defender<00:03:42.170> at

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
good situation for you as a defender at

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.790 
good situation for you as a defender at
that<00:03:43.380> first<00:03:43.650> place<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:45.290> when<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.560> pause

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
that first place so when it's a pause

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.100 
that first place so when it's a pause
for<00:03:47.400> example<00:03:47.880> when<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> past<00:03:48.450> go<00:03:48.720> through

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
for example when the past go through

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.930 
for example when the past go through
here<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:50.610> goalkeeper<00:03:52.430> he's<00:03:53.430> gonna<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.820> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
here the goalkeeper he's gonna be the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.350 
here the goalkeeper he's gonna be the
one<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.650> try<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.770> stop<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.280> shot<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.760> go

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
one to try to stop the shot and go

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.210 
one to try to stop the shot and go
so<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.320> goalkeeper<00:03:59.930> knowing<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.190> are

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
so the goalkeeper knowing that you are

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.170 
so the goalkeeper knowing that you are
blocking<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:03.239> shot<00:04:04.580> has<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.610> block<00:04:06.000> his

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
blocking the shot has to block his

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.210 
blocking the shot has to block his
corner<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:06.780> he<00:04:06.840> goal<00:04:07.170> she<00:04:07.860> should<00:04:08.040> always

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
corner but he goal she should always

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.930 
corner but he goal she should always
keep<00:04:08.580> in<00:04:08.760> mind<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.890> pass<00:04:11.160> she

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
keep in mind that if it's a pass she

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.050 
keep in mind that if it's a pass she
should<00:04:12.120> immediately<00:04:12.560> go<00:04:13.560> straight<00:04:14.310> forward

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
should immediately go straight forward

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.770 
should immediately go straight forward
and<00:04:16.100> up<00:04:17.100> against<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.850> player<00:04:18.269> was<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.510> ball

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
and up against the player was the ball

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.820 
and up against the player was the ball
so<00:04:20.180> he<00:04:21.180> should<00:04:21.359> cut<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.840> angle<00:04:22.260> for<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.950> shot

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
so he should cut the angle for the shot

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.409 
so he should cut the angle for the shot
so<00:04:24.759> he<00:04:24.970> should<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.539> out<00:04:25.569> as<00:04:25.990> far<00:04:26.680> as<00:04:27.009> possible

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
so he should go out as far as possible

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.809 
so he should go out as far as possible
after<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.539> pass<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.650> in<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:30.220> case<00:04:30.520> you're

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
after the pass and in this case you're

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.300 
after the pass and in this case you're
the<00:04:31.060> defender<00:04:31.479> if<00:04:31.629> it's<00:04:31.810> passed<00:04:32.710> goes<00:04:32.979> here

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
the defender if it's passed goes here

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.249 
the defender if it's passed goes here
you<00:04:33.460> just<00:04:33.639> go<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:34.419> little<00:04:34.750> bit<00:04:36.960> closer<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.229> the

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
you just go a little bit closer to the

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.200 
you just go a little bit closer to the
goal<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:40.379> try<00:04:41.379> to<00:04:41.530> get<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.009> possible<00:04:42.610> block<00:04:42.909> of

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
goal to try to get a possible block of

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.950 
goal to try to get a possible block of
the<00:04:43.509> shot<00:04:43.780> from<00:04:44.199> this<00:04:44.379> player<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.509> is<00:04:46.720> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the shot from this player so this is the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.909 
the shot from this player so this is the
the<00:04:47.860> picture<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.610> get<00:04:48.879> this<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.919> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
the picture that you get this is the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.839 
the picture that you get this is the
actions<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:51.940> have<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.360> make<00:04:53.699> when<00:04:54.699> you

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
actions that you have to make when you

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.499 
actions that you have to make when you
