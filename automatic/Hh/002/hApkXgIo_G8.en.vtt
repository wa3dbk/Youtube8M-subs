00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.829
 the 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.480
 now that she discussed driving very long ago, the second is 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.490
 disappointing to hard drive but I almost wanted to be old fashioned with all 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.009
 there also the necessary 3 the court had the free west 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.149
 she did i was the first company to not sell it locked alone 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.679
 the external houses sold then we see further but yes it is therefore one 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.869
 relatively expensive operation uses five toddlers of 600 tons 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 Directing users that is a total of knowing it out after rest was the first 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.880
 which finds that it is on the market based on 750 gigabyte memory game 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.480
 also mainly as external to deal with a problem but they could 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 also very appealing but it is there for us 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.569
 the next to the a13 motorway 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.240
 three terabytes yes filip martens of 750 years 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.290
 did you make it yourself it was the first year ago of fifteen years 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.350
 with all those black bear awards that can confuse a bit 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.070
 yes there are the animals 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 daily average special of this kind of Scherpenzeel quit much more 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.530
 data on this disk a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 as a result, grease 36 may possibly be in the unit because they are simply there 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.979
 a lot of critters on a disk is checking in the advantage is that too 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.490
 If you are naturally in a negatively small housing its huge storage capacity 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 Arsenal spot on one if you have an example yes then you can 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 playfully st radboud with two discs and get four islands 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.380
 towards the water 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.869
 such as really just a year in overijssel is actually not a few years ago 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.830
 In addition, it was necessary to testify small packages 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.420
 could be put yes 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.270
 the moment there is quite a challenge with these discs you would think where you 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.720
 buy one thing first on the more psv and go flat so easy that's not because 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.899
 in the end almost all writing and those that are for sale now work with 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780
 the loose heat sink squeeze 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.440
 that means they are actually with with with with with pluses of 512 bart 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.680
 which can be arrested with a maximum of 32 bits 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.140
 that is achieved 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.920
 and without being respected to see which other operating system actually none 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.979
 Hard disks of more than 100 weeks to avoid a legitimate wind blow is 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.720
 bigger and these 3 so you need a different kind of asturias that you call 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 shaping the rings should do movies that requires that you have not arrived 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.510
 then windows 7 can do what is fine 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.869
 so now seven months to get started talking but it 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.699
 the then he picks up the cu additionally has the sisters sell 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.569
 in places as a second disk 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.490
 in first stone then 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.589
 can win so reports the right level of acting and the road goes 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.929
 9 start up the writers this then it is already a lot harder than it should be 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.680
 your bio-substances and supports 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.260
 before you started the computer is now very stable is active in the district 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.420
 go through the first steps and do not stop anyone from being your referee 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.400
 should start up and if that is controlled it does not support this 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.879
 to be able to advise disk you have a problem yes 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.599
 yes but they then I say in this in the old in the that the audio 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.600
 versions that use layers almost all motherboards 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.050
 is simply not supported for this type had been taken from 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.979
 boot up 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.279
 that is a new idea from your bios v that include Intel on one 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.819
 own mother 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.719
 All all the brand you have systems can become your bios 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.060
 but the PC world is actually not that much there is common then 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.579
 I say very few bios but more of this disk was booting up 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.999
 And if you are already supporting it then you must state it 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.629
 support towers and then the view is completely different 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.199
 i am a little weyts work only the new market hall sata 600 controls that 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.699
 can then boot the midfield sanitel motherboard you have with 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.059
 the internet without sin without them being extra comfortable then you cannot come first 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.090
 state in the miranda listening ear card source for years 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.830
 yes there are many more than normal checks and there are quite a few hooks 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.889
 Eyes normally open controls that when your moms and dads who 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.619
 who at the time, 11-year-old demi moore, predicted to increase the speed 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.159
 this disk doesn't work there either 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.459
 we only have it as that track set but no to idea mode 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.179
 so actually these disks are connected with preferably in the systems 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.159
 such a unloading sata 600 check 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.489
 the incident did it to him it's good it's time for all of them to add as you 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.139
 He buys a farewell for six years and actually felt welcome for much longer 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.500
 in the sandwich yes, because the importance of being animals 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.219
 considered a 100 part of 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.590
 replace the chip south and it will support as of 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.660
 yes now it is now it is actually mainly colin benders datasheet 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.949
 use and vision that time to switch back in addition to meter video a mode 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.419
 that's great making 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.870
 yes if the previous start up the chances that it is now time for a greater the chance 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.400
 that it would be fine with the reason why many manufacturers the incident and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.660
 the best song to choose to have an external enclosure mainly the 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.490
 to explain the legend 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.840
 9 I also understand that there is also a package version of this coming right there 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.110
 a sata 600 originates for its own life 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.410
 and that makes it a bit and that makes up with the writer with a story yes 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.330
 but we have a manifest on a standard there systems 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.449
 that means we had to go back to meter video a mode the street 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:07.220
 where you don't 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.960
 the very best performances were five minutes a bit too 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.840
 equal building of course there will be against these there that decide the hard 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.710
 disk that can upgrade system 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.719
 and i have another look 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.099
 emmeloord in your life juxtaposed the links 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.560
 they already have such a and 2 2 win and drop 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.520
 Drs the other comparison material to the spin content 3 in TB after 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.020
 the missing the most popular drive of help for the past two years 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.300
 we stand which work look a bit like the most popular 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.370
 and in the middle this 3 tb disk from that of best disco 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.320
 and then we see that with a PC market and to score that there is still one 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.710
 bit the performance of saying goodbye in practice comes out of sight just below 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.080
 10,000 points an employee falls under 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.949
 that is clearly more than that spinpoint fc utrecht is at 3,000 points 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.360
 there were many of the ten quickly moving to film filth bear market 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.439
 little money 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.459
 If you look at this idea is simple pinpoint problems that very many people 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.809
 They also have around 4,000 out of six tents he claims 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.069
 it was not surprising that this of course turned their fight down on a bearing 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.899
 speed west indies tomatoes unknown what it is but it is something between 54 

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:18.499
 in the 6,000 rpm that would vary a little bit 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:22.939
 depending on for me from the on demand of the system yes and you see 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.379
 is that those who travel by taxi are likely to offer you some benefits 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.749
 and that if it uses itself as this winning system 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:31.220
 completely on his website 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.099
 could be higher later in the year 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.699
 yes yes the whole top at 2115 level has been coming here for years 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.580
 Well then finally that the price per gigabyte 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.060
 which, of course, is currently disappointing on this disc, on average takes a while 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.229
 250 euros is a little jacobi which is 3 2 against where writing the 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.310
 from sony couple on average for less than 90 euros 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.190
 the price per gigabyte is not great, but that already gave way to yes and no 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.500
 that is where we were allowed and what we still have to do this is only 21 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.499
 September also hold the prices of the 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.819
 are the models in the eye what means who want to see sometimes was 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:08.329
 put it in the offers at a very attractive price and then 

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:11.409
 it's just a matter of searching for a catchy cash register 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:14.249
 and that is a story if you want to set up those hospitals, of course 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:16.539
 if you like this divorce only the word 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:18.530
 a conversation doesn't know yes 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.440
 we have something you want in that against barca I also do not want this speed 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.300
 others stayed away is yes 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.310
 and those who are standing there now make you happy and as your close second 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.840
 quarter
