could<00:02:17.670> actually<00:02:17.819> go<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> junkyard<00:02:18.630> ask

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
could actually go to the junkyard ask

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.890 
could actually go to the junkyard ask
them<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.800> an<00:02:19.890> f-150<00:02:20.370> remote<00:02:20.940> make<00:02:21.599> sure<00:02:21.780> that

them for an f-150 remote make sure that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.660 
them for an f-150 remote make sure that
the<00:02:22.020> FCC<00:02:22.530> ID<00:02:22.739> matches<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:25.220> then<00:02:26.220> go<00:02:26.400> home<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the FCC ID matches and then go home a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.699 
the FCC ID matches and then go home a
program<00:02:27.209> into<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.480> car<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.440> should<00:02:28.620> work

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.940 

also<00:02:31.709> when<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> mentioned<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
also when I mentioned that the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.190 
also when I mentioned that the
instructions<00:02:35.610> worked<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.940> 2000<00:02:36.750> Panthers

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
instructions worked on 2000 Panthers

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.370 
instructions worked on 2000 Panthers
probably<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.069> Grand<00:02:38.280> Marquis<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.760> town<00:02:38.940> core

well<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> kind<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.160> made<00:02:41.400> some<00:02:41.940> misinformation

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
well I kind of made some misinformation

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.320 
well I kind of made some misinformation
there<00:02:42.750> because<00:02:43.080> actually<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.430> works<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
there because actually it works on it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.190 
there because actually it works on it
actually<00:02:45.510> goes<00:02:45.989> back<00:02:46.350> as<00:02:46.530> far<00:02:46.709> as<00:02:46.880> 1999<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> if

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
actually goes back as far as 1999 so if

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.130 
actually goes back as far as 1999 so if
you<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> 1999<00:02:50.220> Panther<00:02:50.940> feel<00:02:51.690> free<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.900> go

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
this again now you don't know you have

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.310 
this again now you don't know you have
twenty<00:05:36.240> seconds<00:05:36.690> from<00:05:36.840> when<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.080> hear<00:05:37.200> the

twenty seconds from when you hear the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.450 
twenty seconds from when you hear the
door<00:05:37.500> lock<00:05:37.680> cycle<00:05:38.010> two<00:05:38.100> different

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
so with that being said here it goes

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.300 
so with that being said here it goes
number<00:05:42.720> one<00:05:44.479> and<00:05:46.130> number<00:05:47.130> two<00:05:49.070> now<00:05:50.070> if<00:05:50.190> you

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
number one and number two now if you

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.279 
number one and number two now if you
have<00:05:50.460> three<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.030> four<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.479> program<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:52.140> the

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
have three and four you program it the

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.510 
have three and four you program it the
same<00:05:52.530> way<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:52.800> did<00:05:53.479> not<00:05:54.479> one<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:54.900> two<00:05:55.520> take

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
same way you did not one and two take

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.460 
same way you did not one and two take
the<00:05:56.640> key<00:05:56.820> out<00:05:56.850> of<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.180> hole<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.630> then<00:05:58.229> test

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
the key out of the hole and then test

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:08.300 
the key out of the hole and then test
your<00:05:58.590> remotes<00:06:05.300> and<00:06:06.740> as<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:07.860> can<00:06:07.979> see<00:06:08.039> they're

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
your remotes and as you can see they're

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.530 
your remotes and as you can see they're
both<00:06:08.460> working<00:06:08.729> fine

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.930 

so<00:06:16.540> I<00:06:17.100> believe<00:06:18.100> this<00:06:18.310> is<00:06:18.370> it

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
so I believe this is it

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.460 
so I believe this is it
