00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Servus people and therefore a hearty 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 welcome 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 today a small point of criticism too 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.370
 a really pretty good one 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 play something falls on a perfect 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 a bmf actor two times the same 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 Already dare we drive 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.650
 have a little further this game has 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.449
 a pretty much there is still a baby hector 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 even the same model and now here 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.529
 twice the same cars side by side 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.750
 that's no coincidence even three times 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 same car side by side weird 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 coincidence or people there still the same 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 effect 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.640
 why i have a star now i have 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.850
 made we drive'd better all 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 is there all this again 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 and then the same place again 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 nice or people and there is that again 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 same again the bn effector same thing 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 model 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.309
 Look at the same cars twice 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 another leg effector today is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 but really bad gta so thought again 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.379
 the same 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 then I think ten could be 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.460
 go on for minutes gta 5 is real 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.199
 a little problem 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.899
 It 's even the biggest problem too 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 two times the same cars again 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 gta 5 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.900
 the weakness of gta 5 is actually 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 really only this vehicle selection or 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 This response is perfect again 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.630
 that's what it's funny too 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 again the same well what I am 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 as a criticism of gta 5 is feeling 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 simply the fact that it is really often 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.170
 only the same happens 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.409
 cars spawn I believe even today 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.820
 not seen hello yes funny too 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.250
 there again again 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 that's where it comes from again 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 still a perfect i could do now 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.500
 to go on like this for hours 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.649
 I do not know what you are doing 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 thought sometimes or most of the time 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.619
 it actually so that the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.460
 vehicle selection is innovative then drives 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.229
 once a convertible then he enters 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.780
 other model 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.990
 and sometimes it's the singleplayer 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.250
 as well as in the online multiplayer the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.259
 at some point only the same cars 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 drive around there again a baby fekter 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.060
 should not I know that is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.800
 somehow I never bake it 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 that will be fixed that is me already 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.730
 really very much 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.650
 almost the same color as before the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.000
 I do not really have very often 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.010
 are noticed are always the same 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.690
 even a broken always the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.230
 the same cars here through the area 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.920
 cruise 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.319
 we are the coolest because we get 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.800
 yes yes cool another car that's me 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.580
 think 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.019
 I even have to clown for her and us 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.700
 pretty much for her when 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.500
 I even need two now 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.140
 stars or not 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.830
 but he does not seek that, I believe 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.830
 or which is that the fantasy 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.209
 he does not need shit that's okay 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.799
 anyway, you know he somehow 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.569
 the same cars were everywhere now 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.650
 just been an exception, but really 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.330
 I have just noticed where I am in the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.980
 got in front of that at once 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.860
 again around the corner then is 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.510
 really strange and I think there 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 you really have to slow down because of that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.620
 is very monotonous 10 20 minutes long 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.000
 to drive through the area always the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.890
 same cars to see 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 have you ever had something else? 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.489
 Seen and there look is mine 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.560
 model now now we go in 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.180
 de facto a company simply 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.470
 this model is a bit here 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 faster then it comes to me a bit 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.620
 better cruising and I think the same when 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.019
 a few more of it turn around 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.090
 why why do you do that kind of people why? 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.069
 you leave exactly the same cars 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.799
 Only whole time because it is in there 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.030
 coincidentally the same okay that is 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.010
 another model but again 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.799
 we have today for the thirtieth 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.190
 seen or 30 times one more 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.269
 defective it funny people I know 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.980
 is not that you already 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:01.239
 noticed and if not respected 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.709
 just cool people red the color of the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.750
 sex and love 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.120
 I have to steal that directly I have to 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.230
 I'll take you hello people 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.329
 after that we will see some of them 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.900
 could definitely be very possible 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.730
 be off please please thank you oh 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.250
 is the nice also finally time 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.310
 new model on the street very nice 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.599
 remains like ok well, but already 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.740
 again a star but I wanted it 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.330
 real easy time to show you that real 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.819
 He always shows the same cars around 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.250
 did you see that there is one in front ? 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.620
 one of them is here and there 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.639
 therefore, only a greener of this and that is 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.139
 is again the same effect 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.460
 people that can not be or 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.990
 that's a bit sad 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.130
 skater track okay now to complain 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.349
 Now let's do a round with the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.789
 bike riding should be online too 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.680
 actually be possible if we have one 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.389
 bmx I do not even find there 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.160
 online bmx for free selection here 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.400
 1 of them is not already 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.720
 he looks almost the same and human 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.340
 skateboard who also chic or well 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 actually i wanted to stop you today 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.259
 really show just how innovative at times 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.370
 this game is from time to time already 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.409
 very funny I do not know why 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.240
 that is also often really in the 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.099
 singleplayer so that one at a time only 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.210
 still has the same vehicles in front of him 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.740
 pretty much unnecessary, actually me 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.120
 I can not understand this problem 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.090
 can understand it so if so 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.560
 a two times that occurs but that one 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.360
 Driving through the area for 20 minutes 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.190
 and always only sees the same shit 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.960
 then it's a bit obvious 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.460
 well people I say goodbye now 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.840
 Take one more from you now 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.219
 nice day I'll take a look now 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.150
 Breaking Bad Season 4 Follow 8 Beautiful 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.150
