00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it in the description if you wanna go

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
it in the description if you wanna go
check<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> first<00:00:47.250> line<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
check it out so the first line as you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.940 
check it out so the first line as you
see<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> says<00:00:48.270> request<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.930> highest<00:00:49.350> fee<00:00:49.620> now

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
see it says request a highest fee now

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
see it says request a highest fee now
with<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> obviously<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.969> assume<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
with that obviously we can assume that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
with that obviously we can assume that
we're<00:00:52.050> gonna<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> call<00:00:52.770> somebody<00:00:53.100> I'm

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we're gonna have to call somebody I'm

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
we're gonna have to call somebody I'm
assuming<00:00:53.820> probably<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.539> Lester<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
assuming probably like Lester and I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
assuming probably like Lester and I
would<00:00:55.890> say<00:00:56.100> maybe<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.629> $2,000<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> good

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
would say maybe like $2,000 is a good

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
would say maybe like $2,000 is a good
estimate<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.940> heist<00:01:00.239> fee<00:01:00.539> might<00:01:00.780> cost

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
estimate that the heist fee might cost

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
estimate that the heist fee might cost
and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.710> moving<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.100> into<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> next<00:01:02.579> two

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and then moving on into the next two

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.130 
and then moving on into the next two
lines<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.809> really

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
lines these are actually really

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.109 
lines these are actually really
important<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.580> line<00:01:05.880> says

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
important so the first line says

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.899 
important so the first line says
earnings<00:01:06.540> heist<00:01:06.869> finale<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.799> play<00:01:08.159> cash

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
earnings heist finale first play cash

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
earnings heist finale first play cash
reward<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> second<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.439> says

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
reward and then the second one says

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
reward and then the second one says
earnings<00:01:11.130> highest<00:01:11.490> finale<00:01:11.760> replay<00:01:12.360> cash

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
earnings highest finale replay cash

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
earnings highest finale replay cash
rewards<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> gives<00:01:14.220> us<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.520> idea<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.909> how

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
rewards so this gives us an idea of how

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
rewards so this gives us an idea of how
heists<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.229> able<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.220> played

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
heists are going to be able to be played

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
heists are going to be able to be played
before<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.299> hit<00:01:18.390> any<00:01:18.570> info<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.020> people<00:01:19.229> were

thousand<00:01:28.110> dollars<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> would

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
thousand dollars and then if you would

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
thousand dollars and then if you would
play<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.030> again<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.990> only<00:01:31.170> get

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
play it over and over again you only get

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
play it over and over again you only get
fifty<00:01:31.920> thousand<00:01:32.280> dollars<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.630> we

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
fifty thousand dollars so these now we

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
fifty thousand dollars so these now we
know<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.229> replay<00:01:34.650> Heights<00:01:34.920> over<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> over

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
know we can replay Heights over and over

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.550 
know we can replay Heights over and over
again<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.299> money<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.079> next<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.409> lines

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
again to get money the next two lines

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
again to get money the next two lines
talk<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.189> minimum<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> maximum<00:01:38.909> cash

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
talk about a minimum and a maximum cash

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
talk about a minimum and a maximum cash
so<00:01:40.140> obviously<00:01:40.500> makes<00:01:40.920> sense<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.759> moving<00:01:42.030> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so obviously makes sense then moving on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
so obviously makes sense then moving on
into<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> next<00:01:42.630> section<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.759> RP<00:01:44.759> heists

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
into the next section we have RP heists

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440 
into the next section we have RP heists
heist<00:01:45.750> fail<00:01:46.140> RP<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:47.040> period<00:01:47.549> now<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
heist fail RP time period now what this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
heist fail RP time period now what this
probably<00:01:48.840> means<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> after<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.979> certain

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
probably means is that after a certain

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
probably means is that after a certain
amount<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.750> fail<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
amount of time if you do fail it you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
amount of time if you do fail it you
will<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> certain<00:01:52.920> amount<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.159> RP<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.880> it's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
will get a certain amount of RP so it's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.830 
will get a certain amount of RP so it's
not<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.329> gonna<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> same

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
not like you're gonna get the same

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.719 
not like you're gonna get the same
amount<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.079> RP<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.189> fail<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
amount of RP if you fail it at the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.280 
amount of RP if you fail it at the
beginning<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> fail<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> end

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
beginning or if you fail it at the end

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
beginning or if you fail it at the end
and<00:01:58.439> continuing<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> next<00:01:59.909> couple<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and continuing that the next couple of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
and continuing that the next couple of
line<00:02:00.390> says<00:02:00.719> RP<00:02:01.140> heist<00:02:01.439> setup<00:02:01.829> fail<00:02:02.130> RP

line says RP heist setup fail RP

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
line says RP heist setup fail RP
percentage<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.200> assuming<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.740> means

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
percentage which I'm assuming that means

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
percentage which I'm assuming that means
you<00:02:05.189> know<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.490> you're<00:02:05.640> setting<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> heist

you know if you're setting up the heist

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.150 
you know if you're setting up the heist

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and you fail it such as like you're

and you fail it such as like you're
trying<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> bank<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> cops

trying to get into the bank and the cops

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.300 
trying to get into the bank and the cops
see<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.649> you're<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.099> you're

everything<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.840> place

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
everything in place

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910 
everything in place
then<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.570> fail<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.990> you'll<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.590> certain

RP at the end if you fail it's a you

RP at the end if you fail it's a you
fail<00:02:22.600> getting<00:02:22.780> away<00:02:23.200> from<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.410> cops<00:02:23.680> or

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
fail getting away from the cops or

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.620 
fail getting away from the cops or
something<00:02:23.890> you'll<00:02:24.310> get<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.610> bigger<00:02:25.300> percentage

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
something you'll get a bigger percentage

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
something you'll get a bigger percentage
of<00:02:25.870> RP<00:02:26.200> then<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> last<00:02:26.830> couple<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.250> lines<00:02:27.430> are

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
of RP then the last couple of lines are

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.160 
of RP then the last couple of lines are
actually<00:02:28.000> interesting<00:02:28.330> as<00:02:28.450> well<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.960> seems

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
actually interesting as well so it seems

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.480 
actually interesting as well so it seems
like<00:02:29.350> they're<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.740> having<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.130> gold

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
like they're going to be having a gold

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.550 
like they're going to be having a gold
silver<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:30.970> bronze<00:02:31.120> medal<00:02:31.840> feature<00:02:32.200> similar

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
silver and bronze medal feature similar

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.750 
silver and bronze medal feature similar
to<00:02:32.770> what<00:02:32.890> they<00:02:32.980> had<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.220> single<00:02:33.730> player

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to what they had in single player

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.700 
to what they had in single player
missions<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.780> I'm<00:02:35.020> assuming<00:02:35.110> if<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
missions so I'm assuming if you do a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.380 
missions so I'm assuming if you do a
heist<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.250> certain<00:02:36.430> amount<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.610> time<00:02:36.880> or<00:02:37.240> I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
heist in a certain amount of time or I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.810 
heist in a certain amount of time or I
know<00:02:37.480> there's<00:02:37.960> gonna<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.260> some<00:02:38.470> sort<00:02:38.650> of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
know there's gonna be some sort of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.280 
know there's gonna be some sort of
criteria<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.060> need<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> meet<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
criteria that you need a meet to get a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.290 
criteria that you need a meet to get a
gold<00:02:41.860> silver<00:02:42.190> or<00:02:42.220> bronze<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.180> will

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
gold silver or bronze and then you will

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.210 
gold silver or bronze and then you will
get<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.420> certain<00:02:43.780> amount<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.990> RP<00:02:44.380> based<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:44.920> what

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
get a certain amount of RP based on what

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.520 
get a certain amount of RP based on what
you<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.360> that's<00:02:46.480> pretty<00:02:46.630> sweet<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.170> then

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you get so that's pretty sweet and then

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.290 
you get so that's pretty sweet and then
finally<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.010> last<00:02:48.040> line<00:02:48.400> expenses<00:02:49.030> heist

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
finally the last line expenses heist

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.810 
finally the last line expenses heist
cost<00:02:49.660> percentage<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.740> remember<00:02:51.310> hearing<00:02:51.580> a

around that so they also added strings

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.970 
around that so they also added strings
for<00:03:19.120> pilot<00:03:19.510> school<00:03:19.780> in<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.260> update<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.709> I'll

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
for pilot school in this update and I'll

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.140 
for pilot school in this update and I'll
put<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.190> picture<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.549> screen<00:03:21.640> as<00:03:21.820> well<00:03:21.910> so

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
put a picture on the screen as well so

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.310 
put a picture on the screen as well so
first<00:03:22.420> four<00:03:22.660> are<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.870> ones<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.170> are

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
first four are the ones that are

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.420 
first four are the ones that are
important<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> other<00:03:23.890> ones<00:03:24.070> don't<00:03:24.220> really

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
important the other ones don't really

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.190 
important the other ones don't really
matter<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> first<00:03:25.299> one<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.750> end<00:03:25.930> it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
matter so the first one at the end it

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.990 
matter so the first one at the end it
says<00:03:26.410> Hydra<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.370> goes<00:03:27.459> best<00:03:27.790> raw

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
says Hydra and then it goes best raw

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.199 
says Hydra and then it goes best raw
milk<00:03:28.660> jet<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.080> then<00:03:29.200> cockatoo<00:03:29.910> now<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:30.970> cat

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
milk jet and then cockatoo now the cat

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.030 
milk jet and then cockatoo now the cat
get<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.600> that's<00:03:31.870> interesting<00:03:32.320> because<00:03:32.440> the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
get to that's interesting because the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.530 
get to that's interesting because the
cat<00:03:33.250> gets<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.549> car<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.030> why<00:03:34.150> would<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.360> be<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
cat gets a car so why would it be in the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
cat gets a car so why would it be in the
pilot<00:03:34.840> school<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.620> don't<00:03:35.769> know<00:03:35.860> what

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
pilot school and I don't know what

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.509 
pilot school and I don't know what
cockatoo<00:03:36.640> could<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.510> used<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:38.190> mil<00:03:39.190> jet

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
cockatoo could be used for mil jet

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.070 
cockatoo could be used for mil jet
obviously<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.060> could<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.480> laser<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
obviously that could be the laser the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.539 
obviously that could be the laser the
military<00:03:41.560> jet<00:03:41.799> that's<00:03:41.980> already<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.310> game

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
military jet that's already in the game

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.240 
military jet that's already in the game
now<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.840> best<00:03:44.110> raw<00:03:44.320> not<00:03:44.769> really<00:03:44.980> sure<00:03:45.130> what

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
