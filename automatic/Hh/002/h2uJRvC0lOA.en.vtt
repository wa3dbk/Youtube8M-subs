00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.350
 at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing the Arch rivals Mario and Stupid 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.959
 sonic for the first time directly opposite each other 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.140
 and although the winter is just gone, his income is already ready for the ice-cold one 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.310
 tip mario sonic at the olympic winter games 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.609
 but unfortunately he has not trained well enough to get a golden slice 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 to win 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 there are countless winter sports to play in this game but as far as we are concerned jump 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.370
 ski jumping out in a positive way 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 as if you were an idol you can fly through the air with such an ego 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 good jump is not about a crazy sibum but about the right timing 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 whether you are twirling around the iq ranks or skating on one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270
 ice rink in the end there is more of the same but in a new one 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 winter jacket 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 but you first neatly pick it up and they performed on the trampoline there is one 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.720
 update when skating 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.910
 purple 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.160
 a 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.160
 Hey 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.970
 in the new festival mode you can shine on all parts and try 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.550
 top in the medal rankings 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.720
 the 18 days of snow fun do not only exist away games because there 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.970
 must also be trained hard from time to time 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 the addition of a festival fashion show for just that little bit of atmosphere 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 summer games top 100 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.100
 to provide extra tension you can challenge opponents via three 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.229
 party games 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.629
 unfortunately this completely misses the mark of this option adds completely 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.579
 nothing 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.620
 there is the wheel of fortune in which you compete for points in various sports 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.289
 placing medals 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.289
 of course we don't get hot or cold from this 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.389
 the dream events on the summer games were not super exciting 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.429
 but now and then you end up in higher atmospheres pin dream events 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:44.849
 You end up in beautiful environments that are the collaboration between Nintendo ickx 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.849
 stand 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.089
 Investors who have committed one Mario theme or in a sonic atmosphere are one 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.089
 absolute feast for the eyes 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.739
 dietitians to find challenging work sometimes because you can just get rid of the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.439
 enjoy the environment meanwhile nice roll is turning and a coke 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.439
 donate because the opponents adapt to your qualities 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.310
 soon and with two fingers in your nose you hold the only medal to the 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 others and of course the challenge is quickly over 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.519
 Mario Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games is an entertaining game 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 especially in the multiplayer very nice news 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.029
 the game looks a lot like its predecessor but is a lot more atmospheric 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.429
 because you quickly miss the challenge on your own, it promises a place in it 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.729
 stage out of reach 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.119
 but Mario Sonic slipped a great performance and we reward that with 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.129
 a seven and a half
