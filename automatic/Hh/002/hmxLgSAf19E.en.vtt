Eric<00:00:58.680> Pincus

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.429 

I<00:01:07.790> think<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> biggest<00:01:09.299> things<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:10.320> away

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I think the biggest things right away

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.640 
I think the biggest things right away
are<00:01:11.030> defensively<00:01:12.170> transition<00:01:13.170> defense<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
are defensively transition defense I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.230 
are defensively transition defense I
think<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.009> video<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.939> could<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.180> much

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
think really video we could do a much

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.480 
think really video we could do a much
better<00:01:15.420> job<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.770> defending<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.280> three<00:01:17.460> I
