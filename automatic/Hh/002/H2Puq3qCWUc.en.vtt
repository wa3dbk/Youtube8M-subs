00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi everyone guys are ultra le for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 update you on a fantastic thing that is 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.130
 has just been announced in gta 5 that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 we already knew but we didn't know that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 were this what is about to appear 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.280
 on screen is really fantastic 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.890
 I keep the commitment to update you on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 this game because there are a lot 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.020
 I don't think he's the best 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.369
 game that there is for charity but it means 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.380
 a lot for me from a point of view 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 videoludico watch look then 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.130
 we knew that gta on next gen would not be 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 was a simple version 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 remastered but I didn't think there 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
 were pushed so far with 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 a single year of time available 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.969
 if not less because they worked 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 at the beginning like crazy people online 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 this will have started working on it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.489
 in depth for less than a year 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 I think this was announced 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 fantastic first person view not for 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 first-person view we knew 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 it would already have arrived but I didn't think that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.990
 it would have been like that or the game is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 been completely renovated for 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.909
 work properly with this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 that is to say, substantially they have been 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.320
 magazines all the details of all 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.780
 animations all the visuals all 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.670
 inside perspectives outside of the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 vehicles with weapons etc for 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 get to this level this is a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 official trailer that was just 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.229
 released by rockstar games in which 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.220
 these sequences are seen in first 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.110
 person 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.270
 we watch it slightly in slow motion 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.280
 as usual you see the quality of the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.500
 details of the helicopter cockpit 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.740
 have been completely redone 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.300
 internal textures that had been made by 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.590
 part for the last version 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.640
 generation because there is little memory 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.040
 on consoles 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.540
 look at yourself how shooting is 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.200
 the has been completely restored 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.300
 new weapons fire modes 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.880
 animations also that I know when aiming 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.770
 when you go to reload the bullets 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.270
 that popped out was all redone 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.490
 because otherwise it would have been a 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.320
 simple to put the visual in the head 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.360
 of the characters would not have been like 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.490
 an official mod made by some 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 kid like it already happened on gta 5 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.060
 instead look su gta iv sorry instead 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.550
 look at the amount of detail there 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.350
 internally things that are not 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.780
 they would see things in the third person 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 they were made specifically for one 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.910
 first-person view that is one 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.590
 visual that could really 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 revolutionize the way we play at 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.910
 so let's say this game 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.200
 repurchase it even though we already have it 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.000
 played a year ago is not a fan idea 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
 hardcore of the series but it can be 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.050
 really an opportunity to replay in 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.209
 unpublished way this title because 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.730
 actually a perspective like that 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.709
 different can give emotions can 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.840
 to show details can do 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.670
 know and live the characters and the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.989
 situations in a totally different way 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.459
 at least in my opinion 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.650
 in fact I have already preordered it in 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.080
 bundled with the ps4 I will get around the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.980
 20 I believe and I will play in first 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.019
 person in my opinion will be an experience 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.080
 totally different however enough 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.640
 other than to justify the full price 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.860
 to which the new game is sold ie 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.620
 they didn't just redo the engine 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.170
 graphic and 1080p the new new view 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.900
 the physical system of vegetation 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.760
 new texture to the new radio stations 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.459
 the new characters of the missions but 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.900
 they have completely restored everything 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.700
 so what is in my opinion is worth 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.170
 absolutely worth replaying then it is 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.560
 obvious that if you don't care about the game 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.450
 it was not worth it to buy it either before or 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.500
 now at least in my opinion, however, look 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.480
 what effect it makes 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.849
 first of all this video I think 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.730
 be registered by ps4 announced 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.069
 that on PC will even turn where 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.799
 other k obviously hardware permitting 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.659
 because to manage that resolution in 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.709
 fluid way with high details I think 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.940
 that you need hardware that you pay around 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.040
 at 1,500 euros 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.170
 so I with the PC that I'm going to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 to assemble maybe I can make it turn 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.940
 decently in 4k but I will prefer to do it 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.900
 shoot in 1080p 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.730
 also look at the entry into the jet 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.230
 fantastic because you already see it yes 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.640
 he saw this animation in the third 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.489
 person but looking at it from the first 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.920
 person is truly phenomenal 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.720
 texture you can see how they have been 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.239
 completely redone or otherwise 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.220
 they are at quadruple resolution as they have 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.770
 announced they also announced 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.990
 I think less than it actually is 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.820
 there will be in the final version in the sense 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.490
 that for example they said there 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.250
 they will be new animals but new animals 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.930
 which we have seen are a few seconds 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.520
 me there will be many more than those 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.830
 that we actually managed to 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.199
 that is, to see the cat the killer whale 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.630
 in my opinion also because I think I have 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.630
 read that there are about 100 new species 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.010
 so many new things are still alive 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.570
 we do n't know them all to discover 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.720
 so one more reason to 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.400
 buy it and dislike the thrill of 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.740
 say look at this thing was not there at least 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.510
 for those who have already played and must not 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.830
 be understood as an impropriety in the 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.270
 against those who bought it the year 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.700
 last because in any case those who bought 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.680
 last year he had a full year of 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.360
 advantage over who will buy it 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.430
 so a huge advantage is 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.860
 simply the desire to present it again in 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.479
 totally new way and not to do 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.650
 a simple remastering would have 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.479
 sold also with a simple one 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.870
 remastering but want to go 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.400
 besides I don't want to hold you back yet 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.200
 thanks for watching this video 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.529
 let me know if I would buy you back for you 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.109
 which console or re you will buy 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.779
 other news as always I will update you and 

00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:35.379
 I'm also going to know how you do 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:37.929
 the rally on xbox 360 by 20 and then 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.909
 we'll do one on ps4 also I'm doing 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.769
 also another type of video that I hope 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.949
 you will like it next time your aden 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.949
 Hello
