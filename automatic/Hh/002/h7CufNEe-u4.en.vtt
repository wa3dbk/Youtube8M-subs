00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.959 
do well with i can use the famas for
like<00:00:37.950> say<00:00:38.340> 30<00:00:39.329> levels<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.340> i'll<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.579> fine<00:00:41.790> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
like say 30 levels and i'll do fine with

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.560 
like say 30 levels and i'll do fine with
it<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.350> then<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> sudden<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.940> can't

it and then just all of a sudden I can't

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.080 
it and then just all of a sudden I can't
use<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> anymore<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.320> seems<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.640> i'll

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
use it anymore it seems like so i'll

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.340 
use it anymore it seems like so i'll
have<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> change<00:00:48.539> another<00:00:48.719> gun<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.140> I'll<00:00:49.260> do

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I just start start sucking with it and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
I just start start sucking with it and
have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> pick<00:00:55.320> something<00:00:55.530> else<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> try<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
have to pick something else to try and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
have to pick something else to try and
do<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.329> while

like and I'm going to zoom into the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
like and I'm going to zoom into the
mini-map<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.520> yellow

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
mini-map here you can see my yellow

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
mini-map here you can see my yellow
arrow<00:01:27.000> aiming<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> red<00:01:27.930> dot<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:29.369> I'm

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
arrow aiming at a red dot and all I'm

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.649 
arrow aiming at a red dot and all I'm
going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> shoot<00:01:30.150> straight<00:01:30.450> across

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
going to do is shoot straight across

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to do is shoot straight across
that<00:01:30.930> arrow<00:01:31.170> towards<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> red

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that arrow towards where I think the red

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
that arrow towards where I think the red
dot<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> hopefully<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
dot is and hopefully that's going to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
dot is and hopefully that's going to
accumulate<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> kill<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:37.020> does

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
accumulate a kill for me and it does

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
accumulate a kill for me and it does
which<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.100> wonderful<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> whenever<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
which is wonderful so whenever you see a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
which is wonderful so whenever you see a
red<00:01:41.549> dot<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.939> map<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.930> you

that if you have hardened done now for
my<00:01:57.570> secondary<00:01:58.020> weapons<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.649> tend<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> run<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
my secondary weapons I tend to run the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.240 
my secondary weapons I tend to run the
Makarov<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.750> extended<00:02:01.200> mags<00:02:01.229> unless<00:02:01.829> I'm

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
Makarov with extended mags unless I'm

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.970 
Makarov with extended mags unless I'm

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
a anti-air custom class in which case

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.530 
a anti-air custom class in which case
obviously<00:02:05.220> I'm<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.910> be<00:02:06.030> running<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
obviously I'm going to be running the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.450 
obviously I'm going to be running the
launcher<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.290> some<00:02:07.470> sort<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> you're<00:02:08.369> gonna

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
launcher at some sort and you're gonna

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.100 
launcher at some sort and you're gonna
see<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> Makarov<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.720> work<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:10.080> here

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
see the Makarov do some work right here

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.070 
see the Makarov do some work right here
because<00:02:10.920> I'm<00:02:11.520> pretty<00:02:11.790> low<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.030> ammo<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
because I'm pretty low on ammo on the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100 
because I'm pretty low on ammo on the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
hardened and ninja pro i believe is what

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.360 
hardened and ninja pro i believe is what
i<00:03:11.459> use<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.910> time<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:13.260> i<00:03:13.380> tend<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.709> use<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
i use this time and i tend to use the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.539 
i use this time and i tend to use the
worst<00:03:15.209> weapons<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.870> often<00:03:16.200> than<00:03:16.320> not

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
worst weapons more often than not

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.250 
worst weapons more often than not
because<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.000> style<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.390> gameplay<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:19.049> i<00:03:19.110> do

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
because the style of gameplay that i do

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.960 
because the style of gameplay that i do
is<00:03:19.769> normally<00:03:20.250> more<00:03:21.890> distant<00:03:22.890> than<00:03:23.100> up<00:03:23.760> close

occur one other thing I've been thinking
about<00:05:36.540> doing<00:05:36.720> was<00:05:37.020> maybe<00:05:37.229> like<00:05:37.350> a<00:05:37.470> dual<00:05:37.680> comm

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
about doing was maybe like a dual comm

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.840 
about doing was maybe like a dual comm
with<00:05:38.100> my<00:05:38.280> son<00:05:38.729> he's<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.540> six<00:05:40.140> years<00:05:40.320> old<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:40.860> we

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
with my son he's a six years old and we

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.280 
with my son he's a six years old and we
wouldn't<00:05:42.120> be<00:05:42.240> playing<00:05:42.479> black<00:05:42.840> ops<00:05:43.020> it

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
wouldn't be playing black ops it

wouldn't be playing black ops it
probably<00:05:43.590> probably<00:05:43.860> be<00:05:44.220> like<00:05:44.570> lego<00:05:45.570> indiana

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
probably probably be like lego indiana

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
probably probably be like lego indiana
jones<00:05:45.990> or<00:05:46.800> something<00:05:47.610> like<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:47.790> i<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:49.710> don't
