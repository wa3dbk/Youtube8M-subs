me<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.410> explain<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.770> yes<00:05:15.190> Jesus<00:05:15.820> all<00:05:16.150> right

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
me to explain it yes Jesus all right

me to explain it yes Jesus all right
well<00:05:16.660> first<00:05:16.690> can<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.260> give<00:05:17.410> us<00:05:17.530> an<00:05:17.620> overview

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
well first can you give us an overview

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.510 
well first can you give us an overview
of<00:05:18.250> exactly<00:05:18.400> what<00:05:18.940> every<00:05:19.510> flip<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.050> just<00:05:20.260> did

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
of exactly what every flip you just did

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.879 
of exactly what every flip you just did
the<00:05:21.520> end<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:21.850> this<00:05:21.940> line<00:05:22.500> went<00:05:23.500> into<00:05:23.770> this

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
the end of this line went into this

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.720 
the end of this line went into this
outlet<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:25.290> my<00:05:26.290> old<00:05:26.560> line<00:05:26.800> went<00:05:27.100> from<00:05:27.190> here

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
outlet and my old line went from here

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.270 
outlet and my old line went from here
down<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.060> there<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.840> bypassed<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.100> it's

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
down to there and I bypassed it so it's

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.780 
down to there and I bypassed it so it's
just<00:05:30.430> one<00:05:30.640> straight<00:05:30.970> line<00:05:31.590> okay<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:33.070> the

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
just one straight line okay and the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.690 
just one straight line okay and the
reason<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.600> works<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.440> heats<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:35.770> up<00:05:35.890> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
reason that works it heats it up the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.520 
reason that works it heats it up the
coolant<00:05:37.120> heats<00:05:37.450> up<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.690> throttle<00:05:38.080> body<00:05:38.169> and

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
coolant heats up the throttle body and

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.730 
coolant heats up the throttle body and
since<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:39.070> bypassed<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:40.110> it's<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.350> heating

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
since we bypassed it it's not heating

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.430 
since we bypassed it it's not heating
heating<00:05:42.040> it<00:05:42.250> up<00:05:42.400> which<00:05:43.060> in<00:05:43.390> whole<00:05:43.840> here<00:05:44.110> in

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
heating it up which in whole here in

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.290 
heating it up which in whole here in
theory<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.340> lowers<00:05:45.760> your<00:05:45.790> air<00:05:46.120> intake

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
theory it lowers your air intake

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.920 
theory it lowers your air intake
temperature<00:05:46.660> which<00:05:47.290> in<00:05:47.590> theory<00:05:48.630> with<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> lower

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
temperature which in theory with a lower

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.060 
temperature which in theory with a lower
intake<00:05:50.350> temperature<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:51.040> increase

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
intake temperature you increase

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.020 
intake temperature you increase
horsepower<00:05:51.669> so<00:05:52.330> that's<00:05:52.690> why<00:05:53.080> I'm<00:05:53.470> auditioning

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
horsepower so that's why I'm auditioning

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.090 
horsepower so that's why I'm auditioning
yes<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.419> that's<00:05:55.690> why<00:05:55.900> this<00:05:55.960> should<00:05:56.229> work

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
yes and that's why this should work

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.560 
yes and that's why this should work
