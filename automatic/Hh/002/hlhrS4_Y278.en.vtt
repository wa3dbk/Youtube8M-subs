one problem with old mopes like Sims on
are<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.200> turn<00:00:04.439> signals<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.670> reason<00:00:06.029> are<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300 
are the turn signals the reason are the

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.210 
are the turn signals the reason are the
flasher<00:00:06.569> relays<00:00:07.080> which<00:00:07.439> are<00:00:07.620> just<00:00:07.800> bi-metal

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
flasher relays which are just bi-metal

flasher relays which are just bi-metal
switches<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.720> pretty<00:00:09.960> unreliable<00:00:10.410> with

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
switches that is pretty unreliable with

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.850 
switches that is pretty unreliable with
the<00:00:11.190> wrong<00:00:11.370> load<00:00:11.610> or<00:00:11.910> defect<00:00:12.510> bulb<00:00:12.780> most<00:00:13.620> of

the wrong load or defect bulb most of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.799 
the wrong load or defect bulb most of
the<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:14.700> does<00:00:14.910> whatever<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.570> once

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the time it just does whatever at once

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
the time it just does whatever at once
and<00:00:16.139> consumes<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.920> lot<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.100> current<00:00:17.580> while

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and consumes a lot of current while

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
and consumes a lot of current while
doing<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:19.170> these<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.800> really<00:00:20.070> old

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
doing so because these are really old

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
include those in the circuit but it's

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.170 
include those in the circuit but it's
not<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.110> main<00:00:44.260> focus<00:00:44.530> with<00:00:45.520> that<00:00:45.790> being<00:00:46.060> said

not the main focus with that being said
let's<00:00:47.080> get<00:00:47.320> started

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.219 

first<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.030> all<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.420> have<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.720> build<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.020> turn

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
first of all we have to build the turn

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.560 
first of all we have to build the turn
signals<00:01:06.649> itself<00:01:07.100> my<00:01:07.790> friend<00:01:08.119> made<00:01:08.330> those

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
signals itself my friend made those

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.230 
signals itself my friend made those
custom<00:01:09.049> sized<00:01:09.290> PCBs<00:01:10.009> we've<00:01:10.460> stripped<00:01:10.790> Cooper

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
custom sized PCBs we've stripped Cooper

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.749 
custom sized PCBs we've stripped Cooper
traces<00:01:11.750> which<00:01:12.290> will<00:01:12.560> fit<00:01:12.770> nicely<00:01:13.009> inside<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
traces which will fit nicely inside the

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.300 
traces which will fit nicely inside the
case<00:01:13.970> later<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:15.080> need<00:01:15.229> 2<00:01:15.439> for<00:01:15.799> each<00:01:15.920> turn

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
case later we need 2 for each turn

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.820 
case later we need 2 for each turn
signal<00:01:16.759> one<00:01:17.270> for<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.600> front<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.080> one<00:01:18.590> for<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
signal one for the front and one for the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.300 
signal one for the front and one for the
back

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
back

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.929 
back
so<00:01:19.820> Aiden<00:01:20.420> total<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:21.100> sold<00:01:22.100> out<00:01:22.220> for<00:01:22.520> orange

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
so Aiden total I sold out for orange

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.200 
so Aiden total I sold out for orange
LEDs<00:01:23.420> on<00:01:23.720> each<00:01:23.990> front<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.649> back<00:01:24.920> site<00:01:25.250> also

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
LEDs on each front and back site also

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.389

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
RGB LED on the front and back side to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.399 
RGB LED on the front and back side to
keep<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.460> circuit<00:01:34.909> simple<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.569> reliable<00:01:36.200> I

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
keep the circuit simple and reliable I

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.620 
keep the circuit simple and reliable I
use<00:01:36.830> bridge<00:01:37.159> wire<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.670> connect<00:01:37.970> all<00:01:38.149> orange

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
use bridge wire to connect all orange

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.320 
use bridge wire to connect all orange
LEDs<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.380> parallel<00:01:39.860> end<00:01:40.100> at<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.850> same<00:01:41.030> thing

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
LEDs and parallel end at the same thing

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.749 
LEDs and parallel end at the same thing
with<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.690> white<00:01:41.869> LEDs<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:43.340> need<00:01:43.520> one

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
with the white LEDs but we need one

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.480 
with the white LEDs but we need one
common<00:01:44.270> anode<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.289> use<00:01:45.560> bridge<00:01:45.860> wire<00:01:46.100> again

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
common anode so I use bridge wire again

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.460 
common anode so I use bridge wire again
to<00:01:46.819> connect<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.270> plus<00:01:47.509> terminal<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.229> the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
to connect the plus terminal of the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.440

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
orange white and RGB LED almost done now

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.760 
orange white and RGB LED almost done now
I<00:01:53.479> connected<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.200> anodes

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
I connected the anodes

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.160 
I connected the anodes
together<00:01:55.100> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.580> front<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.119> back<00:01:56.360> PCB<00:01:56.959> and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
together of the front and back PCB and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.919 
together of the front and back PCB and
the<00:01:57.770> cathode<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.429> each<00:01:58.789> color<00:01:59.119> individually

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
the cathode of each color individually

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.499 
the cathode of each color individually
in<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.649> end<00:02:01.039> I<00:02:01.220> got<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.520> wire<00:02:01.789> for<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.149> common

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
in the end I got a wire for the common

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.649 
in the end I got a wire for the common
anode<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.709> cathode<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.610> orange<00:02:05.030> white

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.220 
the RGB LED on the front is not
connected<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.269> only<00:02:14.480> want<00:02:14.629> red<00:02:15.050> on

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
connected because you only want red on

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.860 
connected because you only want red on
the<00:02:15.319> back<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.860> daytime<00:02:16.370> lights<00:02:16.870> well

the back for the daytime lights well

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.780 
the back for the daytime lights well
there<00:02:18.379> was<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> bit<00:02:18.860> complicated

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
there was a bit complicated

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.540 
there was a bit complicated
now<00:02:20.510> something<00:02:21.230> simple<00:02:21.620> like<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.340> brake

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
now something simple like the brake

common anodes and each color it is also
a<00:02:36.319> good<00:02:36.560> idea<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.040> test<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.519> LEDs<00:02:37.909> whether

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
a good idea to test the LEDs whether

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.350 
a good idea to test the LEDs whether
they<00:02:38.420> still<00:02:38.720> work<00:02:38.959> fine<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> end<00:02:40.330> now<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
they still work fine in the end now the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.809 
they still work fine in the end now the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.119 
and as you can see I chose the 80 tiny
85<00:02:47.000> again<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.200> such<00:02:48.409> a<00:02:48.440> small<00:02:48.860> and

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
85 again it's just such a small and

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.250

and so on it really looked neat at the
