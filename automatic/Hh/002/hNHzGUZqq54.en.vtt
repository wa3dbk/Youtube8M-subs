00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.600
 and opened it and were surprised to see 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.660
 following 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.949

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.119
 dollars today we learned that there is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:32.610
 online later 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 and now we just watch what comes to us 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.740
 has come 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.290
 we have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 two pairs 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 running shoes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 maybach princesses 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 7 sizes 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.480
 these and others came from america in this 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.950
 case from texas 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.090
 so see what takes cambodian 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.000
 the boxes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 For comparison, open the Internet 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 so once again here is apt 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.870
 was prescribed 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.620
 transferred forces 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.770
 open up 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320
 packaging 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.350
 and the box looks absolutely favorite 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.640
 personally 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.640
 reebok company paper 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.980
 we get sneakers 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.980
 cambodia 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.010
 Indonesia 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 look at them attention 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.610
 no obvious differences in our appearance 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.400
 not visible 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.280
 in principle, it would be surprising if 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.610
 they really were 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.950
 All sneakers are going on a single 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.090
 technological scheme for days although 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.180
 sitting using the same 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.600
 of materials 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 very slight 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.290
 changes in appearance 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 we are trying to find them 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 a cat came to work 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 so with internal confrontation 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 to Turkey 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.289
 Indonesia 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.289
 what can be said at first glance 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.059
 at first glance it seems to me that about buying 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.529
 on her risks sneakers completely 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.420
 Ivan nonsense 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.809
 japan white 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.809
 but maybe it's just me 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.529
 it seems 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.529
 let's see that we have a lot of complaints 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.859
 so here is a slight difference 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.869
 and interior trim sneakers 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.559
 in response material 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.499
 cambodian guy 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 will be there 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.549
 music per year 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 on the Cambodian pair, which means more than 80 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.539
 in Soviet times they also tried to escape 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.029
 executive white 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.479
 under someone else's paper products 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.809
 subordinates 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.929
 revenues decreased finishing with a small 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.509
 blue 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.729
 five first differences found 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.349
 look further 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.809
 finish 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.209
 interior decoration 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.089
 in sneakers 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.039
 indonesian guy in session more 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.259
 dark 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.259
 compared to cambodian couple 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:04.949
 on the front of any 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.949
 no difference at all 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.669
 but without us we can say that 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.669
 asked for chicago but sneakers 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.159
 we are cambodian 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.199
 slightly smaller 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.059
 the diameter of the holes themselves well into this 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:25.419
 pretty slightly 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.049
 difference which at first glance and 

00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:29.020
 unnoticed 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.409
 So 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.999
 as Litvinovich thinks like 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.210
 painfully open 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.840
 need to go to us regimental 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.210
 surfaces 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.979
 also 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.280
 but absolutely identical shura cues 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.009
 officials a minute and another leek 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.039
 the same 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.479
 so the conclusion is made 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.580
 despite the fact that 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.229
 this couple area 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.749
 amazingly 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.749
 in indonesia 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.800
 and this whole pair of shoes 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.120
 sneaker fungus princess 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.659
 produced 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.429
 in the country cambodia existence 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.949
 which we are up to today even 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.069
 didn't suspect 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.810
 they have no 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.509
 fundamental differences 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.719
 reebok strictly observes 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.989
 quality standards set for 

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:26.300
 all their units
