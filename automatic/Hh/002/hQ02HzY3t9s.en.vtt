00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.110 

despite<00:00:21.290> making<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.740> most<00:00:22.120> authentic

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
despite making the most authentic

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.840 
despite making the most authentic
experience<00:00:23.750> possible<00:00:23.960> is<00:00:24.680> also<00:00:24.950> about<00:00:25.010> making

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
experience possible is also about making

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.160 
experience possible is also about making
the<00:00:26.060> call<00:00:26.210> handling<00:00:26.390> predictable<00:00:26.960> and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
the call handling predictable and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.350 
the call handling predictable and
consistent<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.920> think<00:00:28.460> there's<00:00:28.580> huge<00:00:28.910> interest

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
consistent I think there's huge interest

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.180 
consistent I think there's huge interest
in<00:00:29.570> terms<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.020> balance<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.500> we<00:00:30.590> have<00:00:30.800> for

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
in terms of the balance that we have for

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.010 
in terms of the balance that we have for
arcade<00:00:31.760> or<00:00:31.790> simulation<00:00:32.360> handling<00:00:32.810> and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
arcade or simulation handling and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.530 
arcade or simulation handling and
personally<00:00:33.890> my<00:00:34.489> preference<00:00:35.090> has<00:00:35.180> always<00:00:35.420> been

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
personally my preference has always been

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.240 
personally my preference has always been
to<00:00:35.690> go<00:00:35.780> down<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.050> simulation<00:00:36.590> path<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.070> can

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
to go down the simulation path you can

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.369 
to go down the simulation path you can
make<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> realistic<00:00:38.180> seem<00:00:38.600> easier<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.170> play<00:00:39.320> for

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
make a realistic seem easier to play for

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.590 
make a realistic seem easier to play for
somebody<00:00:39.770> but<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.489> very<00:00:40.820> very<00:00:41.120> difficult<00:00:41.180> to

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
somebody but it's very very difficult to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.240 
somebody but it's very very difficult to
take<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:42.020> paper<00:00:42.290> handling<00:00:42.530> system<00:00:43.010> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
take a little paper handling system and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.680 
take a little paper handling system and
make<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.550> appeal<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.360> people<00:00:44.540> that

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
make that appeal to the people that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.570 
make that appeal to the people that
prefer<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.110> simulation<00:00:45.590> handling<00:00:45.950> your<00:00:46.340> line

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
prefer the simulation handling your line

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.850 
prefer the simulation handling your line
the<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.180> Brawn<00:00:47.390> test<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.350> reserve<00:00:48.440> driver

the the Brawn test and reserve driver

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.400 
the the Brawn test and reserve driver
for<00:00:49.129> 2009<00:00:49.820> all<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:50.540> job<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.930> developing

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
for 2009 all of that job is developing

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.200 
for 2009 all of that job is developing
the<00:00:51.530> simulator<00:00:51.920> as<00:00:52.100> well<00:00:52.250> we've<00:00:52.640> had<00:00:52.670> access

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the simulator as well we've had access

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.060 
the simulator as well we've had access
to<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.450> teams<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.260> engineers<00:00:54.680> the

to the teams to the engineers the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.580 
to the teams to the engineers the
drivers<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:55.940> what<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:56.360> do<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.600> try<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.230> bounce

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
drivers so what I do is try and bounce

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.479 
drivers so what I do is try and bounce
my<00:00:57.980> level<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.460> expectation<00:00:59.210> off<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.720> who

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
my level of expectation off and who

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.130 
my level of expectation off and who
gives<00:01:01.489> us<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.730> lot<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.880> feedback<00:01:02.120> week<00:01:02.690> by<00:01:02.930> week

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
gives us a lot of feedback week by week

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320 
gives us a lot of feedback week by week
the<00:01:03.770> onboard<00:01:04.160> footage<00:01:04.430> when<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.000> see<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.300> TV

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
the onboard footage when you see on TV

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.749 
the onboard footage when you see on TV
there<00:01:06.050> was<00:01:06.170> look<00:01:06.350> incredibly<00:01:07.009> easy<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.520> drive

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
there was look incredibly easy to drive

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.060 
there was look incredibly easy to drive
when<00:01:08.300> you're<00:01:08.420> inside<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.960> car<00:01:09.140> Sarah<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:09.950> much

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
when you're inside the car Sarah so much

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.590 
when you're inside the car Sarah so much
more<00:01:10.250> twitchy<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.820> nervous<00:01:11.210> that's<00:01:11.420> one

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
more twitchy and nervous that's one

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.940 
more twitchy and nervous that's one
thing<00:01:11.750> that's<00:01:11.899> incredibly<00:01:12.530> hard<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.830> get

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
thing that's incredibly hard to get

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.230 
thing that's incredibly hard to get
right<00:01:13.100> unless<00:01:13.430> you've<00:01:13.610> got<00:01:13.640> someone<00:01:14.000> that's

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
right unless you've got someone that's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.940 
right unless you've got someone that's
actually<00:01:14.660> driven<00:01:14.840> these<00:01:15.020> cars<00:01:15.320> especially<00:01:15.560> in

actually driven these cars especially in
the<00:01:16.009> slow<00:01:16.220> speed<00:01:16.280> course<00:01:16.670> we<00:01:16.910> have<00:01:17.090> no<00:01:17.270> down

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the slow speed course we have no down

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.060 
the slow speed course we have no down
force<00:01:17.479> as<00:01:18.170> soon<00:01:18.380> as<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.560> get<00:01:18.649> them<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:18.890> high

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070

most authentic experience night I think
it's<00:01:40.940> very<00:01:41.000> important<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.929> blunt<00:01:42.319> the

it's very important not to blunt the

it's very important not to blunt the
