00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.490
 genetics is a relatively science 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.109
 young 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.540
 however contribute in numerous 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.950
 fields of human interest the evolution of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 the living beings the emigration of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 human populations in biomedicine has 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 helped understand the biological basis of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.019
 processes like aging has 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.820
 contributed to the discovery of new 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.320
 drugs and above all has allowed 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 understand the predisposition of the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.220
 population to suffer from certain 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.369
 diseases looking for a possible 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 cure in Ecuador doctor caesar peace and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.150
 child and the researcher andrés lópez 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 Cortez have worked in the study of 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.340
 human genes and synthesized 30 years 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 of study in a book called 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 molecular genetics and human cytogenetics 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 the basics and the basics 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 developed in the book are 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.899
 backed by research done in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.050
 Ecuador with students and teachers from 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.870
 Ecuadorians this challenge that represents 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.440
 in own investigations 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 and to have own data and of some 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.110
 way also defend ourselves from this 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.450
 colonialism of knowledge that is 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.350
 we can generate knowledge 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.630
 with local validity but that have 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.330
 international significance because the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.030
 science needs to be nourished by data 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.520
 specific and that's pretty much what 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.649
 we have raised with the book so that it 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.800
 know data from the equator but that 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.300
 have interest 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.520
 the perspective of world knowledge 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.230
 the book addresses areas of transcendence 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.540
 national as disabilities and 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.340
 congenital diseases information that 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.680
 may be used for management in 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 public health as well as hospitals and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.440
 clinics for the treatment of patients 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.460
 when they are updated articles 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.600
 science is 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.759
 application since then 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 It also contains about 90 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.050
 illustrations more than 200 tables 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.510
 a lot of information that is useful 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.540
 for 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.560
 good can be useful for students 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.869
 for professionals for scientists to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000
 booths 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.440
 Ecuadorian researchers highlight 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 in the book the peculiarities 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.970
 genetic characteristics of the population of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 Ecuador discusses its origin with data 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.959
 comparisons of national ethnic groups with 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.000
 ethnic groups from other countries to determine 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.310
 the kinship behavior of 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.409
 drug resistance diseases and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 the answers we have before each one 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.890
 everything seen from a perspective 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.630
 national 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.370
 this variety of research is the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.350
 proof that ecuador has talent 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330
 high-level human capable of 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.500
 develop own knowledge for 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.900
 benefit of the country 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
 the ayayay public company supports this 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
 kind of initiatives in order to 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.660
 integrate the Ecuadorian academy in 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.280
 work projects in conjunction with the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 free dissemination of knowledge
