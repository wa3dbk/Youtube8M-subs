so<00:00:00.149> this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.450> our<00:00:00.599> haptics<00:00:01.079> project<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:02.220> now

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so this is our haptics project right now

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.860 
so this is our haptics project right now
the<00:00:02.429> pr2<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.120> just<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.600> use<00:00:03.780> this

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
the pr2 is just going to use this

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.289 
the pr2 is just going to use this
accelerometer<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.770> find<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.100> table<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.940> once

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
accelerometer to find the table and once

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.390 
accelerometer to find the table and once
it<00:00:06.450> finds<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> table<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:07.799> going<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.040> go<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> a

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
it finds the table it's going to go to a

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.580 
it finds the table it's going to go to a
plan<00:00:08.730> tight<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.300> go<00:00:09.750> through<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> pre-planned

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
plan tight and go through a pre-planned

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
plan tight and go through a pre-planned
correct<00:00:11.010> trajectory<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.910> trajectory<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
correct trajectory this trajectory is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.330 
correct trajectory this trajectory is
based<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> brief<00:00:13.500> user<00:00:13.710> study<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.309> did

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
based on a brief user study that we did

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.460 
based on a brief user study that we did
in<00:00:15.000> which<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.269> blindfolded<00:00:15.839> subjects<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
in which we blindfolded subjects and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.349 
in which we blindfolded subjects and
challenge<00:00:16.859> them<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> find<00:00:17.609> objects<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
challenge them to find objects on a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
challenge them to find objects on a
table<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:19.320> notice<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.680> different<00:00:20.520> search

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
table we notice that different search

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
table we notice that different search
Pat<00:00:20.910> people<00:00:21.449> use<00:00:21.630> different<00:00:21.750> search<00:00:22.109> patterns

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
Pat people use different search patterns

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
Pat people use different search patterns
and<00:00:22.830> they<00:00:23.010> did<00:00:23.250> different<00:00:23.460> techniques<00:00:23.970> based

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and they did different techniques based

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.029 
and they did different techniques based
on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> objects<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> table<00:00:25.769> if<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.949> an

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
on the objects on the table if it's an

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
on the objects on the table if it's an
empty<00:00:26.189> water<00:00:26.490> bottle<00:00:26.849> people<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.599> very

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
empty water bottle people are very

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
empty water bottle people are very
gentle<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.130> heavy

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
gentle if it's like a really heavy

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880 
gentle if it's like a really heavy
object<00:00:29.910> people<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.359> move<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.599> lot<00:00:30.720> faster<00:00:30.890> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
object people can move a lot faster and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.000 
object people can move a lot faster and
it<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.460> interesting<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:34.649> based<00:00:34.890> on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it was really interesting so based on

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
it was really interesting so based on
that<00:00:35.070> knowledge<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.700> move<00:00:35.940> food<00:00:36.570> challenge

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that knowledge we move food challenge

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.590 
that knowledge we move food challenge
appear<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> find<00:00:38.370> objects<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.210> using<00:00:39.480> its

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
appear to to find objects just using its

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
appear to to find objects just using its
tactile<00:00:39.930> sensors<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
tactile sensors and you can see when it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.700 
tactile sensors and you can see when it
hits<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> object<00:00:42.270> acceleration<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
hits the object acceleration the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.549 
hits the object acceleration the
accelerometer<00:00:44.309> fires<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
accelerometer fires and we go into a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.869 
accelerometer fires and we go into a
grasp<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> final<00:00:53.280> presentation

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
grasp so this is the final presentation

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.869 
grasp so this is the final presentation

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
interfaces this is a graduate level

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
interfaces this is a graduate level
class<00:00:58.710> where<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> students<00:00:59.699> design<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
class where the students design and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.840 
class where the students design and
build<00:01:01.109> different<00:01:01.440> haptic<00:01:02.100> interfaces<00:01:02.609> or

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
build different haptic interfaces or

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
build different haptic interfaces or
touch<00:01:03.149> base<00:01:03.510> systems<00:01:04.019> both<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> user

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
touch base systems both the user

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
touch base systems both the user
interact<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.610> virtual<00:01:06.000> world<00:01:06.240> or

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
interact with some virtual world or

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
interact with some virtual world or
control<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> robot<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.890> interact<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.310> its

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
control a robot to interact with its

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.920 
control a robot to interact with its
environment<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.330> through<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> sense<00:01:09.840> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
environment all through the sense of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.670 
environment all through the sense of
touch<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:12.409> designed<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.530> system

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
touch so here we have designed a system

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
touch so here we have designed a system
to<00:01:14.280> help<00:01:14.400> blind<00:01:15.000> people<00:01:15.180> detect<00:01:15.720> obstacles

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to help blind people detect obstacles

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.940 
to help blind people detect obstacles
which<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.650> above<00:01:17.549> waist<00:01:18.420> level<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.080> which

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
which are above waist level and which

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
which are above waist level and which
they<00:01:20.100> cannot<00:01:20.930> detect<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.140> their<00:01:22.320> walking

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
they cannot detect with their walking

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
they cannot detect with their walking
stick<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.119> yeah<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.420 

ultrasound<00:01:29.500> sensor<00:01:29.920> which<00:01:30.870> which<00:01:31.870> has<00:01:32.080> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
ultrasound sensor which which has a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.600 
ultrasound sensor which which has a
preset<00:01:33.430> range<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:35.560> some<00:01:36.280> kind<00:01:36.490> of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
preset range and if some kind of

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.290 
preset range and if some kind of
obstacle<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:37.570> front<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.930> them<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.300> blind

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
obstacle is in front of them the blind

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.710 
obstacle is in front of them the blind
person<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.960> feel<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.970> vibration<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
person can feel a vibration in the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.140 
person can feel a vibration in the
handle<00:01:44.050> we<00:01:44.470> use<00:01:44.620> our<00:01:44.770> hands<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.070> may<00:01:45.220> go<00:01:45.370> yep<00:01:45.820> I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
handle we use our hands you may go yep I

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.400 
handle we use our hands you may go yep I
feel<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:48.430> gone<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.630> works<00:01:49.870> yeah

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
feel it now it's gone and it works yeah

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.310 
feel it now it's gone and it works yeah
I'm<00:01:50.560> like<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.950> yeah<00:01:51.310> our<00:01:52.240> project<00:01:52.750> it's<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:53.050> ball

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
I'm like it yeah our project it's a ball

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380 
I'm like it yeah our project it's a ball
catching<00:01:53.680> game<00:01:53.860> where<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.910> use<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.150> wiimote

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
catching game where we use the wiimote

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.090 
catching game where we use the wiimote
to<00:01:55.720> track<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.080> position<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.560> users<00:01:56.860> in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
to track the position of the users in

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.780 
to track the position of the users in
using<00:01:57.940> infrared<00:01:58.210> sensors<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.140> when<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.520> when

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
using infrared sensors and when the when

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.550 
using infrared sensors and when the when
the<00:02:00.820> user<00:02:01.060> catches<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.720> ball<00:02:01.810> in<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.020> game<00:02:02.260> we
