coming from the basic unit is connected
to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> red<00:01:17.189> wire<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> your<00:01:17.880> hot<00:01:18.060> lead

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
to the red wire that is your hot lead

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
to the red wire that is your hot lead
now<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> red<00:01:20.009> wire<00:01:20.220> coming<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> unit<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
now the red wire coming from the unit is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
now the red wire coming from the unit is
connected<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> battery<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:23.070> your

connected to the battery that's your
power<00:01:23.659> over<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.350> black<00:01:26.009> wire<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
power over here a black wire from the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660 
power over here a black wire from the
siren<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> connected<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> ground<00:01:28.670> black

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
siren is connected for the ground black

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.350 
siren is connected for the ground black
wire<00:01:30.200> from<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> basic<00:01:32.040> unit<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> connected
