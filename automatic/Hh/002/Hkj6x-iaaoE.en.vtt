just<00:01:57.979> go<00:01:58.979> through<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> couple<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> features

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
just go through a couple of the features

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.420 
just go through a couple of the features
here<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.619> you've<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.070> an

here as you can see you've got an

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
here as you can see you've got an
adjustable<00:02:02.969> lens<00:02:03.810> cover<00:02:04.610> shroud<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.299> were

adjustable lens cover shroud as it were

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.440 
adjustable lens cover shroud as it were
and<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.129> helps<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.000> really

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and that really just helps you in really

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.140 
and that really just helps you in really
strong<00:02:09.899> sunlight<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.950> adjust<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
strong sunlight you can adjust that so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150 
strong sunlight you can adjust that so
that<00:02:12.420> you're<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:12.660> getting<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.080> glare<00:02:13.410> across

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that you're not getting a glare across

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.199 
that you're not getting a glare across
the<00:02:14.340> lens<00:02:14.690> look<00:02:15.690> cover<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:18.120> your

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
the lens look cover and just for your

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.190 
the lens look cover and just for your
own<00:02:19.099> bit<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.190> information<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.720> got<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
own bit of information it's got like a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.680 
own bit of information it's got like a
rubberized<00:02:22.770> feel<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:26.040> whole<00:02:26.370> unit<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
rubberized feel to the whole unit as it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.589 
rubberized feel to the whole unit as it
were<00:02:28.050> poops<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.800> waterproof<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.640> thing<00:02:30.319> okay

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.650 

take<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.629> up<00:02:37.050> okay<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.819> can<00:02:38.849> see<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
take that up okay as you can see on the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
take that up okay as you can see on the
underneath<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.760> obviously<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.660> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
underneath this is obviously way and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.660 
underneath this is obviously way and
this<00:02:42.930> doesn't<00:02:43.200> come<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.250> unit<00:02:44.280> itself

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
this doesn't come with the unit itself

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.559 
this doesn't come with the unit itself
you<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.590> rubberized<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.430> well<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.330> it

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
you see this is rubberized as well so it

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.979 
you see this is rubberized as well so it
really<00:02:48.870> gives<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.500> nice<00:02:49.739> secure<00:02:50.370> bed<00:02:50.989> when

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
really gives it a nice secure bed when

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.780 
really gives it a nice secure bed when
then<00:02:52.230> you're<00:02:52.890> mounting<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.459> scope<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
then you're mounting the scope so you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.850 
then you're mounting the scope so you
see<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> name<00:02:57.300> Luger<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.260> see<00:02:58.500> across<00:02:58.739> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
see the name Luger you see across the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.899 
see the name Luger you see across the
top<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.909> have<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> clicking

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
top you have it's it's not a clicking

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.320 
top you have it's it's not a clicking
type<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.659> variable<00:03:04.290> focus<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.920> completely

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
type of variable focus is completely

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.190 
type of variable focus is completely
freely<00:03:06.330> moving<00:03:06.750> from<00:03:07.500> 12<00:03:08.360> through<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.510> 24

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
freely moving from 12 through to 24

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.550 
freely moving from 12 through to 24
through<00:03:10.830> today<00:03:11.220> six<00:03:11.580> times<00:03:11.849> magnification

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
through today six times magnification

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.930 
through today six times magnification
they<00:03:13.560> six<00:03:14.629> very<00:03:15.629> strong<00:03:16.220> magnification<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
they six very strong magnification and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.839 
they six very strong magnification and
what<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.269> find<00:03:18.540> sometimes<00:03:19.349> with<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:20.069> cheaper

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
what you find sometimes with a cheaper

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.030 
what you find sometimes with a cheaper
lens<00:03:21.209> or<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:22.260> cheaper<00:03:23.010> scope<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.769> higher

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
lens or a cheaper scope the the higher

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.539 
lens or a cheaper scope the the higher
the<00:03:26.280> magnification<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.989> less<00:03:28.260> light<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the magnification the less light the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.149 
the magnification the less light the
system<00:03:29.970> brings<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.870> therefore<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.739> really

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
system brings in and therefore it really

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.000 
system brings in and therefore it really
does<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.760> down<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.269> image<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.890> know

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
does go down the image and you know

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.369 
does go down the image and you know
sometimes<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.030> find<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.420> really<00:03:36.659> hard<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.200> get

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
sometimes you find it really hard to get

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.789 
sometimes you find it really hard to get
that<00:03:37.530> clarity<00:03:38.069> but<00:03:39.060> quality<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:40.019> picture

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
that clarity but quality of picture

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.770 
that clarity but quality of picture
what's<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.940> point<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.330> having<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
what's the point in having a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.619 
what's the point in having a
high-powered<00:03:43.440> scope<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:45.030> image<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.540> you

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
high-powered scope if the image that you

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.910 
high-powered scope if the image that you
get<00:03:45.810> at<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:45.989> end<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.290> day<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.940> not<00:03:47.940> very<00:03:48.180> good

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
get at the end of day is not very good

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.009 
get at the end of day is not very good

I'm<00:05:54.699> gonna<00:05:54.879> bring<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:57.900> scope<00:05:58.900> down<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.259> bit<00:06:00.210> and

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
I'm gonna bring the scope down a bit and

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.200 
I'm gonna bring the scope down a bit and
see<00:06:02.319> if<00:06:02.349> we<00:06:02.530> can<00:06:02.680> pick<00:06:02.949> up<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.310> there's<00:06:03.759> a<00:06:03.819> farm
