00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
start and the update as I won't need

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
start and the update as I won't need
them<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.120> only<00:00:57.300> difference<00:00:57.719> between

them and the only difference between

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
them and the only difference between
armor<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.850> clothing<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.300> armor<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
armor and clothing is that armor is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.819 
armor and clothing is that armor is
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.199> armored<00:01:01.530> level

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
going to have an armored level

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.579 
going to have an armored level
associated<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
associated with it so I'm just going to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.149 
associated with it so I'm just going to
make<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> private<00:01:05.540> int<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
make a private int and I'm just going to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969 
make a private int and I'm just going to
say<00:01:08.369> al<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.180> armor<00:01:09.479> level<00:01:09.780> let's<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.740> type

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
say al for armor level let's just type

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.300 
say al for armor level let's just type
it<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:14.210> comment<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.170> armor<00:01:19.130> level<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it out and comment it the armor level of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.700 
it out and comment it the armor level of
this<00:01:20.670> piece

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.410 

of<00:01:27.220> armor<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.549> course<00:01:30.790> we'll<00:01:31.060> make<00:01:31.210> our

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
of armor and of course we'll make our

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:40.290 
of armor and of course we'll make our
public<00:01:32.430> constructor<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.979> by<00:01:39.640> default<00:01:39.880> will

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
public constructor and by default will

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.990 
public constructor and by default will
have<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> armor<00:01:40.900> level<00:01:41.170> set<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.710> zero<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:45.000> I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
have the armor level set to zero and I'm

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.040 
have the armor level set to zero and I'm
also<00:01:46.149> going<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.390> make<00:01:46.509> an<00:01:46.630> overloaded

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
also going to make an overloaded

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.180 
also going to make an overloaded
constructor<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.659> then<00:01:53.470> this<00:01:53.590> one<00:01:53.649> here<00:01:54.070> we're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
constructor and then this one here we're

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.749 
constructor and then this one here we're
going<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.369> pass<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.770> default<00:01:57.220> armor<00:01:57.580> level

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
going to pass in the default armor level

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.680 
going to pass in the default armor level
that<00:01:57.820> we're<00:01:57.940> going<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.090> be<00:01:58.149> loading<00:01:58.420> up<00:01:58.509> from

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
that we're going to be loading up from

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.870 
that we're going to be loading up from
the<00:01:58.810> database<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.860> I'm<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.490> going<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.729> call

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the database so I'm just going to call

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.139 
the database so I'm just going to call
this<00:02:00.910> al<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:04.890> I'll<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.190> assign<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.759> my

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
this al and I'll just assign it to my

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.620 
this al and I'll just assign it to my
arm<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.509> level<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:12.190> we'll<00:02:12.310> make<00:02:12.459> our

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
arm a level then we'll make our

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.650 
arm a level then we'll make our
accessors<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.670> again<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.850> public<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.330> it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
accessors so again it's public and it's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.190 
accessors so again it's public and it's
going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> return<00:02:17.019> an<00:02:17.320> int<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:20.080> just

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
going to return an int and I'm just

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.970 
going to return an int and I'm just
going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.380> call<00:02:20.560> armor<00:02:20.950> level<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.769> will<00:02:26.769> when

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
going to call armor level and will when

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.069 
going to call armor level and will when
I<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:28.290> asset<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:31.870> we'll

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
I get and asset and in the get we'll

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.710 
I get and asset and in the get we'll
just<00:02:32.260> return<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:33.579> armor<00:02:33.910> level<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:37.570> this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
just return the armor level and in this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.009 
just return the armor level and in this
set<00:02:38.049> we'll<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.920> assign<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:40.329> our<00:02:40.630> level

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
set we'll just assign the our level

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.300 
set we'll just assign the our level
according<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.890> value<00:02:42.190> that's<00:02:42.310> passed<00:02:42.640> in

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.530 

and<00:02:48.310> that's<00:02:48.489> pretty<00:02:48.760> much<00:02:48.970> all<00:02:49.209> we're<00:02:49.420> going

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
and that's pretty much all we're going

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.470 
and that's pretty much all we're going
to<00:02:49.599> need<00:02:49.689> for<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.819> armor<00:02:51.819> level<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.239> got<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
to need for the armor level we got the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.509 
to need for the armor level we got the
structure<00:02:52.870> down<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.349> discussed<00:02:54.069> in<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
structure down that we discussed in the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.420 
structure down that we discussed in the
live<00:02:54.700> show<00:02:54.970> 1<00:02:55.799> i'm<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:56.950> going<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.129> quickly<00:02:57.220> go

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
live show 1 i'm just going to quickly go

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.069 
live show 1 i'm just going to quickly go
over<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.939> unity<00:02:58.510> make<00:02:58.720> sure<00:02:58.810> there's<00:02:58.989> no

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
