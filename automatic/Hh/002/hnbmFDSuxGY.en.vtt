00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a picture of what I put in my hair I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
a picture of what I put in my hair I
used<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.750> leave-in<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> went<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.369> with

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
used my leave-in and then I went in with

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.910 
used my leave-in and then I went in with
the<00:01:44.640> activating<00:01:45.210> curl<00:01:45.450> cream<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the activating curl cream and then the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
the activating curl cream and then the
curling<00:01:47.460> custard<00:01:47.790> over<00:01:48.329> top<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.740> both

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
curling custard over top and with both

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
curling custard over top and with both
of<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.579> products<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> pull<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of these products you do have to pull a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
of these products you do have to pull a
with<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> amount<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.950> use<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.540> I'm

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
with the amount that you use I think I'm

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
with the amount that you use I think I'm
always<00:01:55.049> heavy-handed<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.430> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
always heavy-handed and I think I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.850 
always heavy-handed and I think I
probably<00:01:56.700> put<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> does

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
probably put in a bit much so it does

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.490 
probably put in a bit much so it does
kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.250> leave<00:01:59.460> gel<00:02:00.360> cast<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.049> hair<00:02:01.320> if

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
kind of leave gel cast on your hair if

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.310 
kind of leave gel cast on your hair if
you<00:02:01.590> overdo<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.899> bad<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you overdo it but it was not that bad to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.930 
you overdo it but it was not that bad to
scrunch<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.189> crunch

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.560
