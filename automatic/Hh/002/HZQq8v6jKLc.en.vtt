raise<00:00:06.939> a<00:00:07.029> very<00:00:07.210> good<00:00:07.390> point<00:00:07.540> on<00:00:07.720> animal

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
raise a very good point on animal

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.660 
raise a very good point on animal
studies<00:00:08.380> and<00:00:08.559> I<00:00:08.590> couldn't<00:00:08.830> agree<00:00:08.980> more<00:00:09.070> it's<00:00:09.460> a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
studies and I couldn't agree more it's a

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.990 
studies and I couldn't agree more it's a
super<00:00:10.799> physiologic<00:00:11.799> overdose<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:12.610> animal

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
super physiologic overdose to the animal

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.930 
super physiologic overdose to the animal
now<00:00:13.539> there<00:00:13.719> is<00:00:13.870> one<00:00:14.110> thing<00:00:14.320> in<00:00:14.619> 2013<00:00:15.609> there<00:00:15.850> was

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
now there is one thing in 2013 there was

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.480 
now there is one thing in 2013 there was
a<00:00:16.000> trial<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.570> Select<00:00:16.960> trial<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.650> that<00:00:18.310> got<00:00:18.460> a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
a trial the Select trial and that got a

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.580 
a trial the Select trial and that got a
lot<00:00:18.699> of<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:19.060> lot<00:00:19.210> of<00:00:19.240> heat<00:00:19.570> because<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.350> higher

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
lot of a lot of heat because the higher

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.409 
lot of a lot of heat because the higher
levels<00:00:21.100> of<00:00:21.990> EPA<00:00:22.990> DHA<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:24.279> men<00:00:24.460> got<00:00:24.699> much<00:00:25.150> more

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
levels of EPA DHA the men got much more

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.679 
levels of EPA DHA the men got much more
prostate<00:00:26.019> cancer<00:00:26.499> I<00:00:26.999> analyzed<00:00:27.999> that<00:00:28.269> thing<00:00:28.509> I

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
prostate cancer I analyzed that thing I

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.609 
prostate cancer I analyzed that thing I
actually<00:00:28.779> wrote<00:00:29.169> a<00:00:29.199> big<00:00:29.439> paper<00:00:29.740> on<00:00:30.070> it<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
actually wrote a big paper on it and to

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.380 
actually wrote a big paper on it and to
me<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.829> was<00:00:32.950> very<00:00:33.010> very<00:00:33.280> solid<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:34.150> isn't

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
me it was very very solid so that isn't

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.520 
me it was very very solid so that isn't
a<00:00:34.600> human<00:00:34.900> and<00:00:35.380> that<00:00:35.770> was<00:00:36.480> very<00:00:37.480> well<00:00:37.750> done<00:00:37.810> and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
a human and that was very well done and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.549 
a human and that was very well done and
it<00:00:38.649> confirmed<00:00:39.160> an<00:00:39.370> earlier<00:00:40.440> experiment<00:00:41.440> that

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
it confirmed an earlier experiment that

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.009 
it confirmed an earlier experiment that
they<00:00:41.710> did<00:00:41.890> showing<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.370> same<00:00:42.609> thing<00:00:42.850> in<00:00:43.019> 2007

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
they did showing the same thing in 2007

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.380 
they did showing the same thing in 2007
so<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.739> really<00:00:45.399> really<00:00:45.609> have<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.210> look

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
so that you really really have to look

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.920 
so that you really really have to look
at<00:00:46.629> to<00:00:47.019> go<00:00:47.170> why<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.789> heck<00:00:49.000> did<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.239> happen<00:00:49.390> in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
at to go why the heck did that happen in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.900 
at to go why the heck did that happen in
two<00:00:50.109> trials<00:00:50.500> with<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.039> same<00:00:51.340> sort<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.670> thing

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
two trials with the same sort of thing

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.650 
two trials with the same sort of thing
that<00:00:52.149> gets<00:00:52.600> my<00:00:52.719> attention<00:00:52.809> very<00:00:53.559> big<00:00:54.660> already

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
that gets my attention very big already

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.410 
that gets my attention very big already
next<00:00:55.989> question<00:00:56.350> how<00:00:57.280> does<00:00:57.420> supplementing

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
next question how does supplementing

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.450 
next question how does supplementing
with<00:00:58.539> DHA<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.289> EPA<00:00:59.649> cause<00:01:00.010> insulin

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
with DHA and EPA cause insulin

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.610 
with DHA and EPA cause insulin
resistance<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:01.210> inflammation<00:01:02.109> in<00:01:02.410> other

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
resistance and inflammation in other

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.829 
resistance and inflammation in other
words<00:01:02.829> what's<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.640> mechanism<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.269> action<00:01:04.449> for

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
words what's the mechanism of action for

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.630 
words what's the mechanism of action for
that<00:01:04.870> happening<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.920> problem<00:01:06.280> too<00:01:06.460> much

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
that happening is it problem too much

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.420 
that happening is it problem too much
DHA<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.330> EPA<00:01:07.630> or<00:01:07.930> is<00:01:08.260> it<00:01:08.440> oxidation<00:01:09.160> or

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
DHA and EPA or is it oxidation or

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.730 
DHA and EPA or is it oxidation or
rancidity<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.180> them<00:01:10.299> why<00:01:11.140> does<00:01:11.350> high<00:01:11.500> dose

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
rancidity of them why does high dose

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.460 
rancidity of them why does high dose
fish<00:01:12.610> oil<00:01:12.970> cause<00:01:13.270> insulin<00:01:13.659> resistance<00:01:13.840> it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
fish oil cause insulin resistance it

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.640 
fish oil cause insulin resistance it
absolutely<00:01:14.829> does<00:01:15.689> during<00:01:16.689> my<00:01:16.840> presentation<00:01:17.200> I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
absolutely does during my presentation I

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.289 
absolutely does during my presentation I
gave<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:17.950> three<00:01:18.100> journal<00:01:18.549> articles<00:01:18.970> now<00:01:19.119> this

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
gave you three journal articles now this

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.560 
gave you three journal articles now this
is<00:01:19.479> something<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:19.960> can<00:01:20.110> measure<00:01:20.290> take<00:01:21.009> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
is something you can measure take it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.940 
is something you can measure take it
measure<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.810> area<00:01:23.140> under<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.470> curve<00:01:23.500> for

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
measure the area under the curve for

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.160 
measure the area under the curve for
blood<00:01:24.399> glucose<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:24.909> measure<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.750> insulin

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
blood glucose and measure the insulin

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.630 
blood glucose and measure the insulin
output<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.680> you'll<00:01:26.770> see<00:01:26.920> how<00:01:27.009> it's<00:01:27.220> blunted

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
output and you'll see how it's blunted

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.240 
output and you'll see how it's blunted
so<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.299> need<00:01:28.540> more<00:01:28.689> insulin<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.860> drive<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
so you need more insulin to drive it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.870 
so you need more insulin to drive it
through<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.520> membrane<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.659> reason<00:01:32.079> is<00:01:32.470> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
through the membrane the reason is it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.850 
through the membrane the reason is it
displaces<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.259> omega-6<00:01:35.259> in<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.649> cell

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
displaces the omega-6 in the cell

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770 
displaces the omega-6 in the cell
membrane<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:36.549> whenever<00:01:37.090> you're<00:01:37.299> taking<00:01:37.630> too

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
membrane so whenever you're taking too

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.899 
membrane so whenever you're taking too
much<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:38.140> something<00:01:38.579> typically<00:01:39.579> it<00:01:39.700> can't

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
much of something typically it can't

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.300 
much of something typically it can't
burn<00:01:40.390> itself<00:01:40.810> up<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.229> has<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.680> go<00:01:41.799> into<00:01:41.979> tissue

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
burn itself up it has to go into tissue

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.429 
burn itself up it has to go into tissue
so<00:01:42.640> something<00:01:43.030> has<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.329> suffer<00:01:43.600> well<00:01:44.259> it's

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
so something has to suffer well it's

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.109 
so something has to suffer well it's
known<00:01:44.680> in<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.219> journal<00:01:45.549> articles<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
known in the journal articles in the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.709 
known in the journal articles in the
science<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.829> fish<00:01:48.009> oil<00:01:48.310> displaces<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.329> Omega

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
science the fish oil displaces the Omega

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.959 
science the fish oil displaces the Omega
6<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.229> Omega<00:01:50.289> 6<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.070> cell<00:01:51.280> membrane<00:01:51.789> it's

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
6 and Omega 6 and the cell membrane it's

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.459 
6 and Omega 6 and the cell membrane it's
about<00:01:52.119> eleven<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.719> one<00:01:52.750> if<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.170> look<00:01:53.320> at

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
about eleven to one if you look at

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.209 
about eleven to one if you look at
tissues<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:55.180> there's<00:01:55.329> 11<00:01:55.780> times<00:01:56.110> more<00:01:56.409> parent

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
tissues so there's 11 times more parent

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.130
