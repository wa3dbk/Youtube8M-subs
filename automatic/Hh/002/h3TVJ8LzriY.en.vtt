into<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.830> clear<00:00:14.130> patch<00:00:14.370> Tom<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.849> borrow<00:00:15.059> one

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
into a clear patch Tom can I borrow one

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.900 
into a clear patch Tom can I borrow one
trick<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.070> show<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> good<00:00:17.550> people

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
trick so I can show the good people

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.179 
trick so I can show the good people
there<00:00:18.090> go<00:00:18.300> look<00:00:18.510> Tom's<00:00:19.020> got<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
there go look Tom's got one here as you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
there go look Tom's got one here as you
can<00:00:20.340> see<00:00:20.520> there's<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.789> dark<00:00:21.029> area<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
can see there's a dark area and then it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
can see there's a dark area and then it
fades<00:00:22.320> through<00:00:22.740> here<00:00:23.070> into<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.789> sort<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> into<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
fades through here into a sort of into a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.269 
fades through here into a sort of into a
clear<00:00:24.570> area<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> put

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
clear area and what you do is you put

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029 
clear area and what you do is you put
the<00:00:26.400> darker<00:00:26.789> area<00:00:27.119> over<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> sky<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> area

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the darker area over the sky or the area

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.439 
the darker area over the sky or the area
you<00:00:29.130> want<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> darken<00:00:29.580> down<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.179> need<00:00:30.330> not

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you want to darken down it need not

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
you want to darken down it need not
necessarily<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> sky<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
necessarily just be from the sky you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
necessarily just be from the sky you
could<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.669> other<00:00:32.910> things<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
could use it for other things but in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
could use it for other things but in
this<00:00:33.960> case<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> sky<00:00:34.910> let<00:00:35.910> me<00:00:35.969> show<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
this case the sky let me show you what I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.389 
this case the sky let me show you what I
mean<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.960> pop<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.309> we

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
mean let's just pop this let's see if we

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.330 
mean let's just pop this let's see if we
can<00:00:38.489> give<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> moody<00:00:39.210> sky<00:00:39.480> over<00:00:39.930> mr.<00:00:40.260> Mackey<00:00:40.469> let

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
can give a moody sky over mr. Mackey let

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.760 
can give a moody sky over mr. Mackey let
me<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:42.090> happens<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.559> pull<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.920> down

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
me see what happens as I pull this down

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.020 
me see what happens as I pull this down
here<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.430> sneaking<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
here we go you see that sneaking in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
here we go you see that sneaking in
there's<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.510> gray<00:00:48.989> darker<00:00:49.890> sky<00:00:50.129> coming

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
there's like a gray darker sky coming

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
there's like a gray darker sky coming
down<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.850> Tom<00:00:52.520> now<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:53.699> carefully<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
down over Tom now use carefully in the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
down over Tom now use carefully in the
landscape<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.920> enormous

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
landscape this can make an enormous

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.869 
landscape this can make an enormous
difference

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
difference

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
difference
unfortunately<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.260> sun's<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.010> they've

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
unfortunately the sun's just got they've

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
unfortunately the sun's just got they've
just<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.699> which<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.149> whatever<00:01:00.329> happens

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
just got in which is whatever happens

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.139 
just got in which is whatever happens
when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:01.829> exactly<00:01:02.149> thing

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
when you and I get to go exactly thing

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.650 
when you and I get to go exactly thing
isn't<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
isn't it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
isn't it

you're gonna get a shot say of the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
you're gonna get a shot say of the
windmill<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.840> talk<00:01:10.049> us<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> do

windmill so talk us through what you do

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
windmill so talk us through what you do
okay<00:01:11.040> normally<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> won't<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
okay normally what I won't want to do is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
okay normally what I won't want to do is
even<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> exposure<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.520> see

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
even out the exposure as you can see

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
even out the exposure as you can see
we've<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.150> bright<00:01:15.540> sky<00:01:15.950> dark

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we've got this really bright sky dark

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
we've got this really bright sky dark
foreground<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.119> putting<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
foreground so by putting this in the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.700 
foreground so by putting this in the
slot<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> holder<00:01:21.049> I'll<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.320> bring<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
slot in the holder I'll just bring this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
slot in the holder I'll just bring this
down<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.150> sky<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.450> above<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> horizon

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
down over the sky just above the horizon

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
down over the sky just above the horizon
line<00:01:25.619> mm-hmm<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.970> had<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> nice<00:01:27.360> bright

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
line mm-hmm now if we had a nice bright

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
line mm-hmm now if we had a nice bright
sunny<00:01:27.900> day<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:29.040> male<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.490> lit<00:01:29.790> nicely

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
sunny day that male will be lit nicely

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.910 
sunny day that male will be lit nicely
and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.869> probably<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.500> soft

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and I would probably go to a soft

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.249 
and I would probably go to a soft
gradation<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.450> let<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.900> show<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
gradation which let me show you the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.130 
gradation which let me show you the
difference<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> what<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
difference so what you have is some this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
difference so what you have is some this
filter<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.920> showed<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.280> Jane's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
filter which I just showed you on Jane's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.539 
filter which I just showed you on Jane's
camera<00:01:38.939> who's<00:01:39.090> got<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.409> like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> hard<00:01:40.799> line<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
camera who's got a like a hard line the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
camera who's got a like a hard line the
gradation<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.210> quite<00:01:42.450> severe<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:44.070> we

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
gradation is quite severe okay there we

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
gradation is quite severe okay there we
can<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> difference<00:01:45.630> between<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> two

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
can see the difference between the two

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
can see the difference between the two
degradations<00:01:46.619> supriya<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.549> friends<00:01:47.909> yeah

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
degradations supriya here friends yeah

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
degradations supriya here friends yeah
now<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.470> instance<00:01:49.979> we're<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.280> I'm

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
now in this instance we're going I'm

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
now in this instance we're going I'm
going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> show<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.149> higher<00:01:51.329> gradation

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
going to show you the higher gradation

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
going to show you the higher gradation
because<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.770> evident

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
because it's going to be more evident

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
because it's going to be more evident
and<00:01:53.579> why<00:01:53.850> would<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> soft

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and why would you not do it with a soft

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
and why would you not do it with a soft
one<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.740> conditions<00:01:55.950> okay<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> these

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
one on in these conditions okay in these

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.289 
one on in these conditions okay in these
conditions<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.590> flat

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
conditions you know it's really flat

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.420 
conditions you know it's really flat
lighting<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.350> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> accentuate

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
lighting so we really want to accentuate

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
lighting so we really want to accentuate
those<00:02:02.909> clouds<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> bring<00:02:03.659> them<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> little

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
those clouds to bring them out a little

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
those clouds to bring them out a little
bit<00:02:04.350> more<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.829> that's<00:02:04.950> not<00:02:05.250> gonna<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
bit more so that's not gonna be so so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
bit more so that's not gonna be so so
this<00:02:06.360> wouldn't<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> quite<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:06.930> severe<00:02:07.590> that's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this wouldn't be quite so severe that's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
this wouldn't be quite so severe that's
right<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.879> condition<00:02:09.119> we're<00:02:09.539> going

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
right but in this condition we're going

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.880 
right but in this condition we're going
to<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.170> black<00:02:10.379> line<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to get a bit of a black line on the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.740 
to get a bit of a black line on the
blades<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> windmill<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.270> okay

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
blades of the windmill that's right okay

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
blades of the windmill that's right okay
which<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.050> wouldn't

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
which we wouldn't

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.780 
which we wouldn't
have<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.740> softer<00:02:14.100> grad<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.550> you've<00:02:14.670> got

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
have with a softer grad but you've got

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.310 
have with a softer grad but you've got
to<00:02:14.910> do<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.300> more<00:02:15.480> powerful<00:02:15.780> lighting

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
to do that in more powerful lighting

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.250 
to do that in more powerful lighting
okay<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.970> trick<00:02:18.210> with<00:02:18.240> using<00:02:18.720> using<00:02:19.110> these

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
okay so the trick with using using these

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
okay so the trick with using using these
is<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.220> come<00:02:20.430> down<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:21.180> above

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
is that you have to come down just above

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
is that you have to come down just above
your<00:02:21.660> horizon<00:02:22.170> line<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.440> depending<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
your horizon line and depending on the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550 
your horizon line and depending on the
aperture<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.210> you're<00:02:24.420> using<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.440> you're

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
aperture that you're using so if you're

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.470 
aperture that you're using so if you're
using<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.890> small<00:02:26.160> aperture<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.910> transition

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
using a small aperture that transition

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
using a small aperture that transition
is<00:02:27.570> going<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.870> more<00:02:28.080> evident<00:02:28.500> isn't<00:02:28.710> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
is going to be more evident isn't it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
is going to be more evident isn't it
yeah<00:02:29.640> because<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> smaller<00:02:30.600> aperture

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
yeah because with a smaller aperture

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500 
yeah because with a smaller aperture
you've<00:02:31.140> got<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> much<00:02:32.160> much<00:02:32.430> deeper<00:02:32.910> depth<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you've got a much much deeper depth of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
you've got a much much deeper depth of
field<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> means<00:02:34.080> what's<00:02:34.260> close<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.800> lens

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
field it means what's close to the lens

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.460 
field it means what's close to the lens
is<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.490> focus<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.780> transition

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
is more in focus so that that transition

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.470 
is more in focus so that that transition
effect<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:37.980> appear<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:38.400> severe<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.150> Mike

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
effect will appear more severe so Mike

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.690 
effect will appear more severe so Mike
what<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.720> normally<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.560> bring<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.100> down<00:02:41.280> just

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
what I normally do is bring it down just

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.030 
what I normally do is bring it down just
over<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.030> horizon<00:02:42.120> line<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.200> back<00:02:43.710> it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
over the horizon line and then back it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120 
over the horizon line and then back it
off<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.760> tad<00:02:45.060> okay<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.620> also<00:02:46.800> check

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
off just a tad okay you can also check

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.740 
off just a tad okay you can also check
this<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.550> depth<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.820> field<00:02:47.880> preview<00:02:48.060> so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this in your depth of field preview so

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.600 
this in your depth of field preview so
I'm<00:02:48.870> gonna<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.440> push<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.040> button<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
I'm gonna just push that button and I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.060 
I'm gonna just push that button and I
can<00:02:50.670> see<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.990> that's<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.890> right

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
can see that that's just in the right

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.150 
can see that that's just in the right
spot<00:02:53.130> okay<00:02:54.000> there<00:02:54.210> okay<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:56.010> take

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
spot okay there okay and now if we take

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370 
spot okay there okay and now if we take
a<00:02:56.340> picture<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:57.930> anything<00:02:58.080> special

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
a picture so is there anything special

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.720 
a picture so is there anything special
you<00:02:58.590> need<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:58.860> with<00:02:58.980> exposure<00:02:59.340> for<00:02:59.610> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you need to do with exposure for this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.340 
you need to do with exposure for this
kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.060> thing<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.690> exposure<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.290> to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
kind of thing the exposure is going to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.780 
kind of thing the exposure is going to
be<00:03:01.410> worked<00:03:01.650> automatically<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.670> you're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
be worked automatically because you're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.760 
be worked automatically because you're
using<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> matrix<00:03:03.330> metering<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.080> it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
using the matrix metering in this it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410 
using the matrix metering in this it's
going<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.490> you've<00:03:05.820> darkened<00:03:06.330> down

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
going to see that you've darkened down

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.080 
going to see that you've darkened down
the<00:03:06.540> sky<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.800> bringing<00:03:08.040> these<00:03:08.250> exposure

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
it's average a great hat averaging these

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.950 
it's average a great hat averaging these
all<00:03:13.980> out<00:03:14.190> okay<00:03:14.520> okay<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.450> what<00:03:15.540> you're<00:03:15.690> saying

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
with their stuff they could easily be

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
with their stuff they could easily be
using<00:03:18.990> an<00:03:19.860> aperture<00:03:20.220> priority<00:03:20.580> or<00:03:20.910> shutter

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
using an aperture priority or shutter

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
got this really great moody sky has

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.640 
got this really great moody sky has
given<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:33.000> duty<00:03:33.390> sky<00:03:33.660> actually<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.560> you

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
given a really duty sky actually can you

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.080 
given a really duty sky actually can you
take<00:03:34.860> one<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> filter<00:03:35.520> out<00:03:35.670> just<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.000> we

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
take one with the filter out just so we

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.890 
take one with the filter out just so we
can<00:03:36.240> show<00:03:36.420> folks<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.320> difference<00:03:38.600> yeah<00:03:39.600> now

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
can show folks the difference yeah now

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.810 
can show folks the difference yeah now
you<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.710> see<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.100> foreground<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.730> ho

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
you can see the foreground you can ho

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.300 
you can see the foreground you can ho
see<00:03:41.850> any<00:03:42.180> detail<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.020> sky's<00:03:43.350> washed<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:43.950> yeah

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
see any detail the sky's washed out yeah

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.400 
see any detail the sky's washed out yeah
okay<00:03:44.520> but<00:03:45.240> by<00:03:45.360> putting<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.780> back<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
okay but by putting that back in it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.650 
okay but by putting that back in it
evens<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.100> contrast<00:03:47.700> range<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
evens the contrast range out in the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.780 
evens the contrast range out in the
scene<00:03:50.120> there<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.300> go

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
scene there we go

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.950 
scene there we go
and<00:03:53.790> because<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.270> camera<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.690> seeing<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
and because the camera is seeing a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.110 
and because the camera is seeing a
darker<00:03:55.380> sky<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.830> giving<00:03:56.070> slightly<00:03:56.850> more

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
darker sky it's giving slightly more

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.000 
darker sky it's giving slightly more
exposure<00:03:57.540> which<00:03:57.780> brings<00:03:58.260> up<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.500> foreground

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
exposure which brings up the foreground

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.830 
exposure which brings up the foreground
at<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.280> same<00:03:59.490> time<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.390> that's<00:04:00.510> really<00:04:00.660> all

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
at the same time and that's really all

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.840 
at the same time and that's really all
there<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> greater<00:04:01.830> graduated<00:04:02.550> filter

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
there is to a greater graduated filter

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.480 
there is to a greater graduated filter
is<00:04:02.970> not<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.600> difficult<00:04:03.840> yeah<00:04:04.350> yeah<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.370> if

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
is not that difficult yeah yeah so if

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.800 
is not that difficult yeah yeah so if
you<00:04:05.520> want<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.330> filters<00:04:06.690> this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
you want to have a go with filters this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.330 
you want to have a go with filters this
is<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.230> great<00:04:07.440> place<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.710> start<00:04:08.100> because

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
is a really great place to start because

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.160 
is a really great place to start because
they're<00:04:08.490> not<00:04:08.640> complicated<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.570> really

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
they're not complicated and that really

a holder so that you can slide the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.979 
a holder so that you can slide the
filter<00:04:17.549> up<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.090> down<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.390> don't<00:04:18.510> screw<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.930> on

filter up and down you don't screw it on
the<00:04:19.080> front<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.500> can<00:04:19.530> move<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.220> gradation

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
the front you can move that gradation

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.700 
the front you can move that gradation
about<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.360> just<00:04:21.660> buy<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.930> adapter<00:04:22.500> ring
