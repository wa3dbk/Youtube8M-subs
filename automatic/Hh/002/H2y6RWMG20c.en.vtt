game analysis I gotta say nirvana in
China<00:01:16.680> had<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.610> idea<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
China had the right idea going the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
China had the right idea going the
teamfight<00:01:18.810> orange<00:01:19.380> route<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.920> unfortunately

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
teamfight orange route but unfortunately

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.219 
teamfight orange route but unfortunately
it<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> didn't<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.299> work<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.930> lost

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
it just didn't really work out they lost

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
it just didn't really work out they lost
the<00:01:22.710> mid<00:01:22.950> lane<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.790> lost<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.210> bot<00:01:24.420> lane

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the mid lane they really lost a bot lane

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.140 
the mid lane they really lost a bot lane
and<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:25.890> less<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> lots<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.790> lane<00:01:27.000> as

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and more or less a lots of top lane as

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
and more or less a lots of top lane as
well<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.540> losing<00:01:28.049> every<00:01:28.470> single<00:01:28.500> lane<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.189> not

lost<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.830> bought<00:03:00.010> rats<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.550> they<00:03:00.700> were<00:03:00.760> really

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
lost I bought rats and they were really

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.790 
lost I bought rats and they were really
vigilant<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.020> I'm<00:03:02.140> not<00:03:02.260> sure<00:03:02.470> sure<00:03:02.620> what

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
vigilant but I'm not sure sure what

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.850 
vigilant but I'm not sure sure what
exactly<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.660> storm<00:03:05.020> surge<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.440> zipping

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
exactly that the storm surge was zipping

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.770 
exactly that the storm surge was zipping
around<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.400> he<00:03:06.460> was<00:03:06.700> shouldn't<00:03:07.570> really<00:03:07.690> be

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
around and he was shouldn't really be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.570 
around and he was shouldn't really be
zipping<00:03:08.230> around<00:03:08.380> especially<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.340> having

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
zipping around especially in the having

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.280 
zipping around especially in the having
absolutely<00:03:09.880> no<00:03:09.970> map<00:03:10.360> control<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.990> wards

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
absolutely no map control like the wards

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.260 
absolutely no map control like the wards
or<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.860> know<00:03:11.920> they<00:03:12.340> don't<00:03:12.610> have<00:03:12.790> any<00:03:12.970> sight

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
or you know they don't have any sight

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.030 
or you know they don't have any sight
anyway<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:13.870> not<00:03:13.900> too<00:03:14.050> sure<00:03:14.320> what<00:03:14.470> he<00:03:14.950> was

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
anyway so I'm not too sure what he was

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.470 
anyway so I'm not too sure what he was
trying<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> gank<00:03:15.610> off<00:03:15.790> maybe<00:03:16.030> he<00:03:16.210> felt

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
trying to gank off maybe he felt

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840 
trying to gank off maybe he felt
confidence<00:03:16.990> having<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.320> BKB<00:03:17.650> or<00:03:17.920> whatnot<00:03:18.100> but<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
confidence having a BKB or whatnot but I

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.180 
confidence having a BKB or whatnot but I
thought<00:03:19.150> was<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> game<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.990> yet<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:21.160> I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
thought was the game and yet that I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.040 
thought was the game and yet that I
think<00:03:21.580> he<00:03:21.700> asked<00:03:21.940> went<00:03:22.150> out<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.540> his<00:03:22.720> own<00:03:22.870> and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
think he asked went out of his own and

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.420 
think he asked went out of his own and
of<00:03:23.110> course<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> devices<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> neck<00:03:24.310> were

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
of course the devices and the neck were

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.700 
of course the devices and the neck were
like<00:03:24.550> really<00:03:24.820> they<00:03:25.120> were<00:03:25.300> just<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.810> guess<00:03:26.320> they

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
like really they were just I guess they

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.430 
like really they were just I guess they
were<00:03:26.770> really<00:03:27.100> trying<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> find<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.030> way<00:03:28.180> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
were really trying to find a way to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.699 
were really trying to find a way to
fight<00:03:29.440> themselves<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.040> back

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
fight themselves and back

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.110 
fight themselves and back
because<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.129> could<00:03:31.280> never<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.609> get<00:03:31.879> back

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
because you could never really get back

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.970 
because you could never really get back
in<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.299> game<00:03:32.420> just<00:03:32.480> by<00:03:32.840> defending<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.799> gotta

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
in the game just by defending you gotta

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.280 
in the game just by defending you gotta
go<00:03:34.189> on<00:03:34.219> the<00:03:34.459> offense<00:03:34.790> offense<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.599> sometime<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
go on the offense offense of sometime so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.349 
go on the offense offense of sometime so
maybe<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:37.099> was<00:03:37.370> their<00:03:37.609> way<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.269> the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
maybe that was their way of going on the

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.789 
maybe that was their way of going on the
offensive<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.989> just<00:03:39.200> didn't<00:03:39.590> really<00:03:39.650> work

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
offensive and it just didn't really work

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.160 
offensive and it just didn't really work
out<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.370> back<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:41.000> time<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:41.810> little

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
out for that back that time so a little

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.569 
out for that back that time so a little
bit<00:03:42.260> unfortunate<00:03:42.739> for<00:03:42.859> nerve<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.129> China<00:03:43.400> I

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
bit unfortunate for nerve on China I

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.160 
bit unfortunate for nerve on China I
think<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:43.969> game<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.450> dragged<00:03:44.719> if<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
think if the game just dragged if the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.979 
think if the game just dragged if the
game<00:03:45.319> dragged<00:03:45.620> out<00:03:45.739> maybe<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.400> like<00:03:47.299> 20<00:03:47.689> or<00:03:47.780> 30

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
game dragged out maybe to like 20 or 30

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.759 
game dragged out maybe to like 20 or 30
more<00:03:48.230> minutes

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
more minutes

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.709

the necrolyte and the storm sir and the
vise<00:03:50.870> which<00:03:51.079> might<00:03:51.500> have<00:03:51.709> carried<00:03:52.459> them<00:03:52.670> back

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
vise which might have carried them back

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.729 
vise which might have carried them back
in<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.450> game<00:03:53.599> against<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.139> relatively
