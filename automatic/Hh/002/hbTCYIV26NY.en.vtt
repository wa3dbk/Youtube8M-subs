00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.910
 yes hello together here infect 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.910
 in cologne i have again 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.920
 because you like my side 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.810
 something special for us today 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.009
 testing will be a new coating 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.310
 from palio the amigo 40 plus we test 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.779
 this covering today with the new plastic 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.480
 ball you as well as already in hand 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.540
 many of you think that will keep you informed 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.910
 the new plastic was a little less 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.329
 spin should be so that the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.030
 exciting question will be how the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.809
 evidence and of course the woods 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.920
 So how are you with the new one? 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.710
 play plastic ball 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 many say that the Chinese 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160
 occupy at the moment are slightly in the advantage 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.190
 because of course they are something sticky something 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.320
 are more handy and we will be today 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.140
 test how it plays with his today 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.699
 Wicker wood with a plate of it too 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.500
 usually plays on the backhand 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.540
 and hold the palio amigo 40 percent 2.1 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 on the fored she like you already have 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.080
 first impressions with the plastic ball 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 had 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.830
 how do you feel that way 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.870
 classic chinese plaque that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.280
 actually has little momentum now 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.830
 will you think that there 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.520
 maybe there are advantages or are you there? 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.600
 rather skeptical 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.310
 as already said, yes 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 explains that at the spin opening that 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.410
 just a little bit more power 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.730
 must spend the necessary spin as 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.970
 with the ball I hope now 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.990
 through the handy surface and the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.140
 With respect to the new ball , that's enough 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.850
 Do not get that athletic now 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.400
 extra, so to speak, and has to spend 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.680
 the same technique as before can play 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.150
 but I really do not know what 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.410
 I am really and very much 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.270
 cocked on the cover 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.360
 if we just do that in practice now 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.220
 try it out and contact us later 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.220
 a first conclusion again much fun 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.190
 Welcome back to the spin 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.970
 factory testcenter 7 I just checked 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.110
 he tested the palio amigo 40plus 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.390
 your first impression 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.890
 yes my first impression was very positive 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.220
 I found the lining has a lot of the ball 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.260
 given a lot of spin 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.900
 That's what you had to do now 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.970
 athletics do not give so much gas 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.210
 Do not do more than then 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.870
 with the celluloid ball and am positive 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.660
 Surprised and continues to give the question 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.880
 like you to like duden amigo 40plus 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.320
 I found a similar impression 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.810
 yes, we have with the plastic at 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.120
 tested the lining is in itself on the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.490
 first impression if you play the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.050
 quite hard you look at the swarm 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.690
 here looks the swarm is however 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.190
 quite roughly report and one 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.979
 a bit softer but has the rubber 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.600
 right on top of that has that 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.850
 worked quite well together like me from 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.860
 and I could play a lot of spin 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.020
 when I hit as well as pressure 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.950
 make and play how was that? 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.720
 with you in the impact setback 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.169
 area you have to deal with it well 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.270
 come 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.680
 exactly in the rebate for 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.300
 I found an oil area yes I think 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.889
 a handy prove 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.620
 they then have the necessary control that 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.430
 you can lay balls briefly and with the 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.570
 that was plastic ball in the test 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.010
 not the case 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.349
 I had a little less of that 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.669
 control now with the amigo 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:28.740
 40plus I get this necessary control 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.610
 that me that setbacks 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.340
 can vary 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.630
 and of course you found that with dashl 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.360
 a strong forehand and really found 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.900
 that the balls are very very hard and me 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.490
 I came back I had the feeling 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.669
 above all, they also had a good one 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.760
 Then stretch the balls with exactly that 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:57.710
 I can definitely put a top coating on it 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:06:02.750
 recommend it fell back out 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.750
 from the spin infections test center
