00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.169 

now<00:00:09.469> that<00:00:09.709> we<00:00:09.830> have<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.099> penguin<00:00:10.459> modeled<00:00:11.000> and

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
now that we have the penguin modeled and

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.470 
now that we have the penguin modeled and
textured<00:00:11.750> let's<00:00:12.349> make<00:00:12.530> a<00:00:12.559> move<00:00:13.330> this<00:00:14.330> will

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
textured let's make a move this will

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.599 
textured let's make a move this will
give<00:00:14.599> us<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:14.750> opportunity<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.469> not<00:00:16.219> only<00:00:16.250> look

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
give us the opportunity to not only look

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.400 
give us the opportunity to not only look
at<00:00:16.820> some<00:00:17.029> of<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.210> animation<00:00:17.689> tools<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.050> form<00:00:18.259> Z

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
at some of the animation tools in form Z

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.690 
at some of the animation tools in form Z
but<00:00:18.529> also<00:00:18.680> look<00:00:18.950> at<00:00:19.070> some<00:00:19.250> additional

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
but also look at some additional

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.279 
but also look at some additional
modeling<00:00:20.150> tools<00:00:20.329> and<00:00:20.539> how<00:00:20.599> we<00:00:20.660> can<00:00:20.869> use<00:00:21.050> these

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
modeling tools and how we can use these

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460 
modeling tools and how we can use these
modeling<00:00:21.800> tools<00:00:22.009> as<00:00:22.250> animation<00:00:23.029> tools<00:00:23.390> also

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
modeling tools as animation tools also

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.990 
modeling tools as animation tools also
now<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.680> we<00:00:26.770> have<00:00:26.800> everything<00:00:26.920> modeled<00:00:27.820> and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
now that we have everything modeled and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.150 
now that we have everything modeled and
textured<00:00:28.510> let's<00:00:28.750> go<00:00:28.870> ahead<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.110> animate<00:00:29.650> the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
textured let's go ahead and animate the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.130 
textured let's go ahead and animate the
penguin<00:00:30.520> let's<00:00:31.390> start<00:00:31.480> off<00:00:31.690> with<00:00:31.810> this<00:00:31.900> foot

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
penguin let's start off with this foot

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.660 
penguin let's start off with this foot
here's<00:00:32.440> one<00:00:32.619> way<00:00:32.740> to<00:00:32.770> animate<00:00:33.190> objects<00:00:33.550> in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
here's one way to animate objects in

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.820 
here's one way to animate objects in
form<00:00:33.940> Z<00:00:34.180> it's<00:00:34.360> called<00:00:34.510> keyframe<00:00:35.200> animation

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
form Z it's called keyframe animation

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.650 
form Z it's called keyframe animation
click<00:00:36.370> on<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.550> keyframe<00:00:37.000> tool<00:00:37.239> clicking<00:00:37.510> the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
click on the keyframe tool clicking the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.960 
click on the keyframe tool clicking the
object<00:00:38.020> and<00:00:38.200> what<00:00:39.100> we<00:00:39.160> need<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.400> do<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.610> tell<00:00:39.850> it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
object and what we need to do is tell it

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.940 
object and what we need to do is tell it
object<00:00:40.360> where<00:00:40.540> we<00:00:40.810> want<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.200> be<00:00:41.440> at<00:00:41.590> certain

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
object where we want it to be at certain

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.910 
object where we want it to be at certain
points<00:00:42.309> in<00:00:42.400> time<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.540> timeline<00:00:44.050> move

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
points in time with the timeline move

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.030 
points in time with the timeline move
the<00:00:45.070> object<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:46.300> as<00:00:46.840> I<00:00:46.870> scrub<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.530> timeline

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
the object and as I scrub that timeline

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.250 
the object and as I scrub that timeline
back<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.550> forth<00:00:48.790> you'll<00:00:49.600> see<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.020> the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
back and forth you'll see that the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.320 
back and forth you'll see that the
object<00:00:51.070> automatically<00:00:51.730> interpolates

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
object automatically interpolates

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.479 
object automatically interpolates
between<00:00:52.570> those<00:00:53.230> two<00:00:53.440> key<00:00:53.710> frame<00:00:53.980> positions

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
between those two key frame positions

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.280 
between those two key frame positions
let's<00:00:55.030> move<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.420> timeline<00:00:55.809> down<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.080> little

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
let's move the timeline down a little

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.620 
let's move the timeline down a little
further<00:00:56.700> you<00:00:57.700> know<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.000> point<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.390> time<00:00:58.420> I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
further you know that point in time I

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.170 
further you know that point in time I
want<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.050> object<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.470> be<00:00:59.560> right<00:00:59.739> there<00:00:59.950> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
want the object to be right there and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.580 
want the object to be right there and
let's<00:01:01.180> move<00:01:01.300> down<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.750> one<00:01:01.930> second<00:01:02.380> mark

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
let's move down to the one second mark

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.170 
let's move down to the one second mark
that<00:01:02.890> point<00:01:02.980> I'm<00:01:03.310> going<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.520> drag<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:03.760> back<00:01:04.000> to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that point I'm going to drag it back to

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.719 
that point I'm going to drag it back to
the<00:01:04.300> very<00:01:04.420> beginning<00:01:05.190> I'll<00:01:06.190> play<00:01:06.399> that<00:01:06.550> back

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
the very beginning I'll play that back

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.070 
the very beginning I'll play that back
and<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.030> can<00:01:07.149> see<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.570> interpolate

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
and you can see it just interpolate

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.139 
and you can see it just interpolate
through<00:01:08.530> those<00:01:08.680> few<00:01:08.950> key<00:01:09.250> frame<00:01:09.640> positions

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
through those few key frame positions

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.139 
through those few key frame positions
that<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.390> give<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:10.780> I<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:12.430> stop<00:01:12.640> anywhere<00:01:13.090> along

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
that I give it I can stop anywhere along

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.300 
that I give it I can stop anywhere along
the<00:01:13.660> way<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.110> transform<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> object<00:01:15.220> by

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the way and transform the object by

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.120 
the way and transform the object by
moving<00:01:15.759> rotating<00:01:16.330> or<00:01:16.600> scaling<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.170> informs<00:01:17.950> e

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
moving rotating or scaling it informs e

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.580 
moving rotating or scaling it informs e
will<00:01:18.280> automatically<00:01:19.119> keep<00:01:19.390> track<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:20.050> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
will automatically keep track of the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.340 
will automatically keep track of the
position<00:01:20.950> for<00:01:21.190> us<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:22.570> can<00:01:22.660> see<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> rotated

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
position for us so you can see I rotated

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.290 
position for us so you can see I rotated
the<00:01:23.530> foot<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:23.860> when<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.460> goes<00:01:24.610> up<00:01:24.640> at<00:01:24.970> that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
the foot so when it goes up at that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.630 
the foot so when it goes up at that
point<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:25.720> time<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:26.110> will<00:01:26.140> rotate<00:01:26.410> up<00:01:26.830> now<00:01:27.430> if<00:01:27.550> I

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
point in time it will rotate up now if I

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.430 
point in time it will rotate up now if I
play<00:01:27.940> this<00:01:27.970> back<00:01:28.300> in<00:01:28.479> real<00:01:28.690> time<00:01:28.899> notice<00:01:29.319> that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
play this back in real time notice that

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.080 
play this back in real time notice that
it<00:01:29.530> goes<00:01:29.679> through<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.009> one<00:01:30.130> cycle<00:01:30.610> because

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
it goes through the one cycle because

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.520 
it goes through the one cycle because
that's<00:01:31.270> all<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.720> keyframed<00:01:32.259> at<00:01:32.380> this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
that's all that I keyframed at this

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.859 
that's all that I keyframed at this
point<00:01:32.819> I'm<00:01:33.819> not<00:01:34.000> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.179> keyframe<00:01:34.539> every

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
point I'm not going to keyframe every

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.660 
point I'm not going to keyframe every
single<00:01:35.170> step<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.649> takes<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.130> what<00:01:36.580> I'll

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
single step that it takes so what I'll

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.160 
single step that it takes so what I'll
do<00:01:36.759> is<00:01:36.789> I'll<00:01:36.940> go<00:01:37.090> into<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.420> animation<00:01:37.840> editor

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
do is I'll go into the animation editor

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.590 
do is I'll go into the animation editor
pellet<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.039> here<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.179> that<00:01:40.420> I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
pellet and here you can see it that I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.510 
pellet and here you can see it that I
can<00:01:40.810> see<00:01:40.959> a<00:01:40.990> graphical<00:01:41.500> representation<00:01:42.340> of

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
can see a graphical representation of

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.120 
can see a graphical representation of
all<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.209> key<00:01:43.390> from<00:01:43.569> information<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.500> just

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
all the key from information that I just

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.010 
all the key from information that I just
recorded<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.910> can<00:01:46.479> go<00:01:46.569> through<00:01:46.600> each<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.929> those

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
recorded I can go through each of those

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.870 
recorded I can go through each of those
tracks<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:47.500> say<00:01:47.590> well<00:01:47.740> go<00:01:48.039> ahead<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.250> repeat

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
tracks and say well go ahead and repeat

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.090 
tracks and say well go ahead and repeat
each<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.750> those<00:01:49.840> tracks<00:01:50.200> over<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:50.800> over<00:01:50.860> again

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
each of those tracks over and over again

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.730 
each of those tracks over and over again
and<00:01:51.459> I<00:01:52.090> can<00:01:52.240> also<00:01:52.300> modify<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.929> keyframe<00:01:53.440> value

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and I can also modify the keyframe value

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.859 
and I can also modify the keyframe value
here<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.069> for<00:01:54.250> example<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.810> maximum<00:01:55.810> height

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
here to for example the maximum height

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.589 
here to for example the maximum height
value<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.530> can<00:01:56.740> actually<00:01:56.890> modify<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:58.209> keyframe

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
value I can actually modify the keyframe

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.540 
value I can actually modify the keyframe
value<00:01:58.899> by<00:01:59.020> dragging<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.830> maybe<00:01:59.950> modifying

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
value by dragging it and maybe modifying

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.339 
value by dragging it and maybe modifying
the<00:02:00.700> velocity<00:02:01.209> curves<00:02:01.509> like<00:02:01.690> an<00:02:01.840> increase<00:02:02.200> or

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
the velocity curves like an increase or

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.070 
the velocity curves like an increase or
decrease<00:02:02.530> how<00:02:02.979> fast<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:04.179> goes<00:02:04.330> into<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:04.869> out<00:02:04.899> of

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
decrease how fast it goes into or out of

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.990 
decrease how fast it goes into or out of
that<00:02:05.200> keyframe<00:02:05.619> position<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.310> all<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.849> can

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
that keyframe position and all that can

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820 
that keyframe position and all that can
be<00:02:07.030> modified<00:02:07.390> right<00:02:07.750> here<00:02:08.050> within<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
be modified right here within the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.180 
be modified right here within the
animation<00:02:09.340> editor<00:02:09.490> pellet<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.069> we<00:02:12.160> have

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
animation editor pellet now that we have

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.490 
animation editor pellet now that we have
the<00:02:12.550> foot<00:02:12.819> animated<00:02:13.390> let's<00:02:14.170> go<00:02:14.319> ahead<00:02:14.380> and

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the foot animated let's go ahead and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.230 
the foot animated let's go ahead and
animate<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.610> rest<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> body<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:19.120> with

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
animate the rest of the body now with

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.850 
animate the rest of the body now with
that<00:02:19.270> we'll<00:02:19.840> look<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> deformation<00:02:20.680> tool

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that we'll look at the deformation tool

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
that we'll look at the deformation tool
now<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.280> point<00:02:21.520> we'll<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.030> look<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.239> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
now at this point we'll just look at the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.690 
now at this point we'll just look at the
modeling<00:02:22.870> capabilities<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.220> deformation

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
modeling capabilities of the deformation

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.220 
modeling capabilities of the deformation
tool<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.030> then<00:02:25.120> we'll<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.870> we<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.110> also

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
tool and then we'll see how we can also

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.670 
tool and then we'll see how we can also
animate<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.400> defamation<00:02:27.700> parameters<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:29.560> can

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
animate the defamation parameters we can

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.190 
animate the defamation parameters we can
do<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.770> radial<00:02:30.190> bend<00:02:30.459> grab<00:02:31.390> any<00:02:31.569> object<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
do a radial bend grab any object and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.840 
do a radial bend grab any object and
pretty<00:02:32.770> much<00:02:32.800> bend<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.460> any<00:02:33.610> direction

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
pretty much bend it in any direction

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.710 
pretty much bend it in any direction
that<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.540> need<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.740> we<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.920> bend<00:02:36.100> them<00:02:36.190> forward

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that we need so we can bend them forward

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.000 
that we need so we can bend them forward
maybe<00:02:37.720> backwards<00:02:38.230> we

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
maybe backwards we

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.039 
maybe backwards we
also<00:02:39.250> resize<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.970> defamation<00:02:40.239> box<00:02:40.689> which

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
also resize the defamation box which

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.770 
also resize the defamation box which
resizes<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> area<00:02:42.400> that's<00:02:42.730> affected<00:02:43.299> by<00:02:43.629> that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
resizes the area that's affected by that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.539 
resizes the area that's affected by that
particular<00:02:43.930> deformation<00:02:44.739> tools<00:02:44.950> maybe<00:02:45.280> bend

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
particular deformation tools maybe bend

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.030 
particular deformation tools maybe bend
just<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.939> top<00:02:46.180> portion<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.500> penguin<00:02:47.829> to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
just the top portion of the penguin to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.309 
just the top portion of the penguin to
bend<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.579> head<00:02:48.790> long<00:02:49.599> list<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.959> options

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
bend just as head long list of options

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.470 
bend just as head long list of options
here<00:02:50.379> how<00:02:50.560> about<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.709> twist<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.180> maybe<00:02:52.390> I'll

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
here how about a twist so maybe I'll

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.690 
here how about a twist so maybe I'll
twist<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.769> bottom<00:02:54.099> half<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> his<00:02:54.549> body

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
twist just a bottom half of his body

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.550 
twist just a bottom half of his body
here<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.629> looks<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:55.840> he's<00:02:56.019> walking<00:02:56.200> back

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
here so it looks like he's walking back

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.190 
here so it looks like he's walking back
and<00:02:56.590> forth<00:02:57.450> now<00:02:58.450> these<00:02:58.569> are<00:02:58.750> controlled

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
and forth now these are controlled

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.020 
and forth now these are controlled
parameters<00:02:59.769> so<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.920> go<00:03:00.040> back<00:03:00.069> at<00:03:00.340> any<00:03:00.519> time<00:03:00.790> and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
parameters so I go back at any time and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.059 
parameters so I go back at any time and
if<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.510> query<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.989> parameters<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.709> object

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
if I query the parameters of the object

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.740 
if I query the parameters of the object
you<00:03:03.129> can<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.610> all<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.060> deformation

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
you can see that all the deformation

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.569 
you can see that all the deformation
information<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.440> here<00:03:05.709> stored<00:03:06.310> with<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
information is here stored with the

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.089 
information is here stored with the
object<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.870> modify<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.319> radial<00:03:08.890> bend

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
object so I can modify the radial bend

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.970 
object so I can modify the radial bend
angle<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.579> can<00:03:10.000> modify<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.959> twisting<00:03:11.440> angle<00:03:11.799> I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
angle I can modify the twisting angle I

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.610 
angle I can modify the twisting angle I
came<00:03:12.670> in<00:03:12.790> add<00:03:13.060> additional<00:03:13.599> deformations<00:03:14.409> here

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
came in add additional deformations here

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.819 
came in add additional deformations here
if<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.799> want<00:03:15.010> also<00:03:15.400> for<00:03:15.909> example<00:03:16.269> i<00:03:16.329> can<00:03:16.510> add

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
if I want also for example i can add

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.619 
if I want also for example i can add
let's<00:03:17.829> say<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> bulge<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.060> i<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.269> maybe<00:03:19.359> play

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
let's say a bulge so i can maybe play

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.300 
let's say a bulge so i can maybe play
with<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> values<00:03:20.109> here<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.590> sort<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.129> ball

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
with the values here and sort of ball

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.890 
with the values here and sort of ball
jam<00:03:21.519> out<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.790> any<00:03:22.000> direction<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.510> need<00:03:22.690> so

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
jam out in any direction in need so

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.360 
jam out in any direction in need so
looks<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.620> very<00:03:23.739> well-fed

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
looks like we have a very well-fed

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.199 
looks like we have a very well-fed
penguin<00:03:24.849> here<00:03:25.090> i<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:26.799> also<00:03:26.950> disable<00:03:27.340> any<00:03:27.730> of

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
penguin here i can also disable any of

the deformations i have assigned to that

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.649 
the deformations i have assigned to that
now<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.609> point<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.060> using<00:03:31.329> the

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
now at this point this is using the

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.420 
now at this point this is using the
deformation<00:03:32.170> tool<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> modeling<00:03:33.040> tool<00:03:33.069> now

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
deformation tool as a modeling tool now

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.039 
deformation tool as a modeling tool now
we<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.639> also<00:03:33.760> animate<00:03:34.209> these<00:03:34.389> parameters<00:03:34.930> so

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
we can also animate these parameters so

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.580 
we can also animate these parameters so
we<00:03:35.170> do<00:03:35.620> animated<00:03:36.250> twist<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.989> assign<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
we do animated twist and assign it to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.039 
we do animated twist and assign it to
the<00:03:38.709> object<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.129> can<00:03:39.280> see<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.879> list<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.569> all

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
the object you can see a list of all

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.629 
the object you can see a list of all
those<00:03:41.260> different<00:03:41.470> parameters<00:03:42.069> here<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.489> us

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
those different parameters here for us

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.670 
those different parameters here for us
and<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.329> can<00:03:43.480> change<00:03:43.780> those<00:03:43.959> values<00:03:44.379> over<00:03:44.650> time

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and we can change those values over time

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.689 
and we can change those values over time
so<00:03:45.579> let's<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.319> lower<00:03:47.319> angle<00:03:47.699> there's

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
so let's go to the lower angle there's

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.369 
so let's go to the lower angle there's
just<00:03:48.819> one<00:03:48.910> keyframe<00:03:49.269> value<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:50.049> that<00:03:50.139> at<00:03:50.260> this

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
just one keyframe value for that at this

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.409 
just one keyframe value for that at this
point<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.650> time<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.099> move<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:52.150> be<00:03:52.239> any

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
point in time and I move it to be any

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.140 
point in time and I move it to be any
angle<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.900> want<00:03:53.199> overtime<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:54.150> can

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
angle that I want overtime I can

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.939 
angle that I want overtime I can
graphically<00:03:55.629> create<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:59.319> value<00:03:59.709> over<00:03:59.919> time

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
graphically create that value over time

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.909 
graphically create that value over time
by<00:04:00.810> giving<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.989> keyframe<00:04:02.349> values<00:04:02.680> may<00:04:02.859> be

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
by giving it the keyframe values may be

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.280 
by giving it the keyframe values may be
plus<00:04:03.280> 30<00:04:03.579> degrees<00:04:03.669> minus<00:04:04.180> 30<00:04:04.569> degrees<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:05.109> back

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
plus 30 degrees minus 30 degrees on back

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.199 
plus 30 degrees minus 30 degrees on back
plus<00:04:05.590> again<00:04:05.859> and<00:04:06.489> just<00:04:06.579> have<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.879> repeat<00:04:07.180> I

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
plus again and just have that repeat I

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.610 
plus again and just have that repeat I
played<00:04:07.480> back<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:07.959> that's<00:04:08.019> all<00:04:08.199> it<00:04:08.319> does<00:04:08.349> now

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
played back and that's all it does now

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.819 
played back and that's all it does now
is<00:04:08.829> go<00:04:09.250> back<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.760> twist<00:04:10.090> plus<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.019> minus<00:04:11.319> 30

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
is go back and twist plus and minus 30

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.020 
is go back and twist plus and minus 30
degrees<00:04:12.599> let's<00:04:13.599> modify<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.669> overall<00:04:15.669> limits

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
degrees let's modify the overall limits

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.120 
degrees let's modify the overall limits
for<00:04:16.269> example<00:04:16.660> take<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:17.019> upper<00:04:17.560> limit<00:04:17.859> drag

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
for example take that upper limit drag

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.189 
for example take that upper limit drag
that<00:04:18.280> down<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.699> only<00:04:18.820> half<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.209> object<00:04:19.959> twist

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
that down so only half the object twist

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.129 
that down so only half the object twist
maybe<00:04:20.979> drag<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.370> further<00:04:21.609> down<00:04:21.909> so<00:04:22.120> only<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
maybe drag it further down so only the

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.719 
maybe drag it further down so only the
bottom<00:04:23.440> ten<00:04:23.620> percent<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.159> object<00:04:24.520> twist

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
bottom ten percent of the object twist

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.719 
bottom ten percent of the object twist
and<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.449> course<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.720> can<00:04:25.870> keyframe<00:04:26.349> that

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
and of course you can keyframe that

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.820 
and of course you can keyframe that
value<00:04:27.729> over<00:04:27.940> time<00:04:27.970> also<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:30.639> if<00:04:30.699> i<00:04:30.789> turn<00:04:30.849> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
value over time also so if i turn the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.020 
value over time also so if i turn the
other<00:04:32.830> layer<00:04:33.099> on<00:04:33.280> here<00:04:33.460> which<00:04:33.550> has<00:04:33.669> some<00:04:33.820> other

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
other layer on here which has some other

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.149 
other layer on here which has some other
additional<00:04:34.690> animation<00:04:35.500> deformations

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
additional animation deformations

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.529 
additional animation deformations
assigned<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.760> object<00:04:37.090> we<00:04:37.270> get<00:04:37.419> the

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
assigned to the object we get the

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.820 
assigned to the object we get the
animated<00:04:37.960> penguin<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.349> looks<00:04:38.500> like<00:04:38.590> this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
animated penguin that looks like this

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.830 
animated penguin that looks like this
and<00:04:39.070> there's<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.430> foot<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.690> did<00:04:40.810> earlier

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and there's the foot that we did earlier

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.659 
and there's the foot that we did earlier
and<00:04:41.409> he's<00:04:41.650> spending<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:42.010> lot<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.159> time<00:04:42.280> walking

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
and he's spending a lot of time walking

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.969 
and he's spending a lot of time walking
but<00:04:43.120> he's<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.419> getting<00:04:43.840> anywhere<00:04:44.169> because

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
but he's not getting anywhere because

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.500 
but he's not getting anywhere because
he's<00:04:45.190> still<00:04:45.340> static<00:04:45.760> in<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:45.909> same<00:04:46.090> position

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
he's still static in the same position

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.670 
he's still static in the same position
so<00:04:46.630> what<00:04:46.750> we<00:04:46.810> can<00:04:46.960> do<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.169> take<00:04:47.380> all<00:04:47.560> those

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
so what we can do is take all those

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.230 
so what we can do is take all those
objects<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.340> put<00:04:48.520> those<00:04:48.610> into<00:04:48.789> an<00:04:48.909> animation

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
objects and put those into an animation

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.080 
objects and put those into an animation
group<00:04:49.650> then<00:04:50.650> we<00:04:50.710> animate<00:04:51.099> just<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.460> group<00:04:51.669> we

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
group then we animate just the group we

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.320 
group then we animate just the group we
can

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
can

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.149 
can
keyframe<00:04:52.569> animate<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.620> group<00:04:53.800> where<00:04:53.949> we<00:04:54.039> can

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
keyframe animate the group where we can

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.420 
keyframe animate the group where we can
also<00:04:54.310> look<00:04:54.819> at<00:04:55.090> another<00:04:55.930> new<00:04:56.199> tool<00:04:56.439> here<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.340> I

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
also look at another new tool here and I

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.640 
also look at another new tool here and I
made<00:04:57.580> along<00:04:57.819> paths<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:59.289> you<00:04:59.409> take<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
made along paths so you take the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.499 
made along paths so you take the
animation<00:05:00.009> group<00:05:00.159> click<00:05:00.909> on<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.090> path<00:05:01.270> now

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
animation group click on the path now

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.959 
animation group click on the path now
the<00:05:01.750> animation<00:05:02.259> group<00:05:02.439> follows<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.099> path<00:05:03.370> and

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
the animation group follows the path and

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.610 
the animation group follows the path and
of<00:05:04.449> course<00:05:04.629> everything<00:05:05.020> inside<00:05:05.199> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
of course everything inside the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.559 
of course everything inside the
animation<00:05:06.159> group<00:05:06.400> follows<00:05:06.969> along<00:05:07.090> with<00:05:07.389> it

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
animation group follows along with it

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.010 
animation group follows along with it
and<00:05:07.750> that's<00:05:08.530> how<00:05:08.680> we<00:05:08.740> get<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.520> penguin

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
and that's how we get the penguin

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.520 
and that's how we get the penguin
animated<00:05:11.020> following<00:05:11.680> along<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:12.250> path
