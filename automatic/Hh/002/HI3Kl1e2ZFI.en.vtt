of it the way that comes from the
factory<00:00:54.860> we're<00:00:55.860> finding<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.190> little

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
factory we're finding this little

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
factory we're finding this little
adapter<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.440> basically<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> xbox<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.170> ps1

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.100 
adapter it's basically a xbox to ps1
adapter<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.340> cut<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> end<00:01:02.820> off<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
adapter but we cut the end off of it and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
adapter but we cut the end off of it and
just<00:01:04.199> wire<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.619> directly<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
just wire it directly into the to the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
just wire it directly into the to the
connector<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.580> zip

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
connector there then this will get zip

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
connector there then this will get zip
tied<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.060> somehow<00:01:09.299> we'll<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
tied or somehow we'll make a little

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.210 
tied or somehow we'll make a little
bracket<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> hold<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.189> place

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
bracket for that to hold that in place

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.109

in this particular printer SD card I
still<00:02:12.670> haven't<00:02:12.820> figured<00:02:13.000> out<00:02:13.180> exactly<00:02:13.240> how

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
still haven't figured out exactly how

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.870 
still haven't figured out exactly how
we're<00:02:13.959> going<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.320> SD<00:02:14.620> card<00:02:14.860> into<00:02:15.610> this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
we're going to get the SD card into this

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.620 
we're going to get the SD card into this
slot<00:02:16.170> currently<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.290> printing<00:02:18.120> from<00:02:19.120> an<00:02:19.270> SD

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
slot currently it's printing from an SD

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.810 
slot currently it's printing from an SD
card<00:02:19.830> which<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.980> right<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.520> there<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.560> it's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
card which is right in there but it's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.160 
card which is right in there but it's
accessed<00:02:24.820> through<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.300> panel<00:02:25.660> here<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.050> it's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
accessed through the panel here so it's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.440 
accessed through the panel here so it's
really<00:02:26.410> not<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.040> big<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.520> deal<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:27.910> we'll

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
really not that big of a deal but we'll

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.480 
really not that big of a deal but we'll
figure<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:29.680> some<00:02:29.950> point<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.459> I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
figure that out at some point and then I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.820 
figure that out at some point and then I
also<00:02:30.700> want<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.090> work<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.530> print

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
also want to work out the the print

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
also want to work out the the print
pause<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.370> restart<00:02:33.810> button<00:02:34.810> right<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:34.959> or

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
the continue button but this is actually

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.240 
the continue button but this is actually
printing<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:41.880> finished<00:02:42.880> version<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.570> this

panel<00:02:45.250> right<00:02:45.580> here<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.910> doesn't<00:02:46.330> i<00:02:46.420> ran<00:02:46.630> out

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
panel right here this doesn't i ran out

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.229 
panel right here this doesn't i ran out
of<00:02:46.830> filament<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:48.580> happens<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> this

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
of filament what happens is this

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.050 
of filament what happens is this
actually<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.870> then<00:02:50.800> latches<00:02:51.280> on

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
actually just then latches on

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.770 
actually just then latches on
to<00:02:54.060> their<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.069> heavier<00:02:56.069> panel

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
to their then you have a heavier panel

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970 
to their then you have a heavier panel
attached<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.110> machine<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.950> course

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
attached to the machine and of course

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.860 
attached to the machine and of course
this<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.640> goes<00:03:00.090> behind<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.629> but<00:03:00.780> I'm

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
this this goes behind there but I'm

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.830 
this this goes behind there but I'm
holding<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.800> camera<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.400> can't<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.700> that

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
holding the camera so I can't do that

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.360 
holding the camera so I can't do that
and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.290> guess<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> final<00:03:04.920> thing<00:03:05.220> I'll

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and then I guess the final thing I'll

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.100 
and then I guess the final thing I'll
show<00:03:05.610> today<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:09.180> right<00:03:09.569> here<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.810> has

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
show today is this right here this has

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.940 
show today is this right here this has

really turned out nicely this is a

I've<00:03:34.890> tried<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.610> number<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.940> different<00:03:36.150> brands

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
I've tried a number of different brands

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.569 
I've tried a number of different brands
and<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.590> only<00:03:37.620> one<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.190> has<00:03:38.340> enough

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
and this is the only one that has enough

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.720 
and this is the only one that has enough
torque<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.510> drive<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.739> filament<00:03:41.220> correctly

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
torque to drive the filament correctly

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.089 
torque to drive the filament correctly
and<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:44.549> not<00:03:44.700> even<00:03:44.730> really<00:03:45.120> running<00:03:45.480> warm<00:03:46.099> so

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
and it's not even really running warm so

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.130 
and it's not even really running warm so
it's<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.209> know<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.420> apps<00:03:48.569> aren't<00:03:48.840> even

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
it's you know the apps aren't even

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.780
