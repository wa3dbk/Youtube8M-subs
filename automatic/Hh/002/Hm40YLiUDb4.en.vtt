00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.980
 statement of the queen mother 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.800
 remember that is 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.960
 have sentenced the second in this 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.870
 case again the winning team of 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.100
 Yesterday had been the green team 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.549
 the first one sentenced by the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.549
 red team 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.100
 Peace or the life of man 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.440
 green team won yesterday so or 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.550
 a sentenced 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.550
 there will be a sentenced 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 we manage at once but today 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.520
 we will have one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.960
 and not two trend 2 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.140
 first 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.140
 it will be chosen by the green team and the second 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 Y 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.840
 the second 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.360
 the second 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.350
 will be another competitor of the losing team 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.820
 but this time they will choose their own 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.610
 friends 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 therefore I explain quickly the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.220
 green team again have the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.620
 possibility of sending someone to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.260
 sentence and in this case the red team 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.300
 your own classmates are also going to 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.560
 sentence a fighter is to say 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.050
 quickly the red team in only two 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 days will happen to have three 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.229
 sentenced and on Friday they go to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.440
 fight for his stay in combat the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.420
 queen question mothers we go once with 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.539
 the first sentence with which it is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 I want progress shelter if something 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:12.510
 has an eye that can not sentence the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:17.240
 Mr. Savater and Mr. Andrei 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.710
 each vote for AndrÃ© is assumed 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.960
 because they are the same person this andrÃ©s 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.060
 I'm replacing there are two 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.000
 different competitors no votes 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.350
 then for mister eric savater yes 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.260
 wants to show put and they have to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.540
 say andrÃ©s as simple as this ok 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.670
 let's say that Andres right now in this 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.740
 moment is acting as eric 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.200
 savater to see if we go to a sentence 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.150
 so the team threw his position to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.290
 the usual green team with what 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.290
 is crescent and we go with the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.290
 judgment
