so<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.630> purchase<00:00:01.050> logos<00:00:01.439> for<00:00:01.740> because<00:00:02.129> you

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so you purchase logos for because you

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.770 
so you purchase logos for because you
heard<00:00:02.399> it<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:02.550> fast<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.240> it<00:00:03.360> was<00:00:03.480> fabulous

heard it was fast and it was fabulous

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.320 
heard it was fast and it was fabulous
but<00:00:04.740> then<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.400> get<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.580> window<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.060> says

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
but then you get a window that says

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.500
