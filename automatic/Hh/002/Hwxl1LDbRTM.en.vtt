00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
where's it at the beginning a naruto was

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.530 
where's it at the beginning a naruto was
notorious<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.370> having<00:02:18.670> filler<00:02:19.060> episodes

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
notorious for having filler episodes

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.729 
notorious for having filler episodes
which<00:02:19.780> kind<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.080> meant<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.410> i<00:02:20.470> stopped

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
which kind of meant that i stopped

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.620 
which kind of meant that i stopped
watching<00:02:20.830> earlier<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> earlier<00:02:22.330> arcs

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
watching earlier on but the earlier arcs

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.360 
watching earlier on but the earlier arcs
that<00:02:22.750> i<00:02:22.810> did<00:02:23.080> watch<00:02:23.319> we're<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:23.920> good<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
that i did watch we're really good and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.640 
that i did watch we're really good and
really<00:02:24.430> stuck<00:02:24.880> with<00:02:24.910> me<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.420> Chunin<00:02:25.810> exam<00:02:26.350> art

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
really stuck with me the Chunin exam art

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
really stuck with me the Chunin exam art
I<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.220> was<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.580> exciting<00:02:28.150> arc

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
I think that was a really exciting arc

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.449 
I think that was a really exciting arc
so<00:02:28.600> basically<00:02:29.110> naruto<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.739> his<00:02:29.890> friends<00:02:30.370> are

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
so basically naruto and his friends are

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.610 
so basically naruto and his friends are
all<00:02:30.610> taking<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.510> exam<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.020> become<00:02:32.140> Chunin

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
at all however there was a catch in this

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.120
