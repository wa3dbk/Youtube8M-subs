00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439

 I can 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.599
 the standard that well that I have stretched arm yes 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.859

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.469
 ds I cannot swim in water 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.129
 because yes in the water 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.700
 suspend that last fifteen seconds and postma for the people with extra things 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.959
 sit 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.769

 an internal work too late I sit there giving them I thought all those present 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.119
 but yes i tell 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:53.409
 then such a noise goes where it is just so beautiful to break through and there are 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.369
 in between science I have finished this previously seen beer 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.189

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 i'm telling continents 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.069
 they were years last year 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.879
 I have a compass 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.290
 I sometimes go to Ameland but I saw that it was very smart I will 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.699
 a frugal one because it is probably also Roosendaal 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.699
 dr what 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.150
 that can not go we first try our best to do the 300,000 judgment 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.320
 have taught people how to play so far doing good collecting annually 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.499
 boys yes and 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.839
 we'll find out if that was a good idea 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.939
 No 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.249
 and then s venray, for example, if the flowers are not good 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.869
 unpacked 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.869
 only then is our list our tip for you to profit from 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.709
 there are no flowers 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.179
 completely this is going to work 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.769
 i'm serious i'm on the rise movies i wake up a block 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.799
 I saw that said prince get and then we go underground that means well seen 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.189
 and it was unsettled 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.749
 you can really refrain from his class stien on underground in your to 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.539
 can teleport above 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.200
 but yes why would be 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.950
 because serac can kill you 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.239
 but why 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 so we just haven't all been killed 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.729
 why 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.509
 because he is a starting fisherman, his butt is still 15 seconds away 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.539
 why also an explanation immediately 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.790
 is that behind anyway 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.790

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 I have a weakness for your cows 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.770
 in that corner 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.800
 I feel strong before I have had to pilot 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.610

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.610
 at the hague script 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.219

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.830
 I am the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.789
 first off the air 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.849
 thank you guys look good that was not really with cigarettes the turning point 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.820
 on seeing them they felt we were seriously cheated 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.510
