00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.720
 It is one machine 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:13.560
 Today I use a bug orange 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:18.800
 I made an alcohol stove, so I will try a combustion experiment 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.800
 First, alcohol fuel 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.140
 De' between say a cow 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.140
 Gifu 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.120
 Te' grinded until the old days 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.800
 There you ho 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 2 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.100
 It's likely to run out of your Gochi and wind What about 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410
 6 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.380

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.240
 Do you want me 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.250
 Say to see the curse 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.250
 f 1 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 Hmm 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.609
 me 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.609
 If the glue and the fire is put around in 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.610
 If the wind stops 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.720
 I told you to be a jet 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.710
 It has become avoided up or grow up a wind 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 New Rays 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.910
 Hmm 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.910
 okay 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.450
 It comes with a decent Sunday 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 I think me become divided by the fire if there is a wind flickering 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.810
 can not 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.079
 I'm stuck around the ground Use it with this squirt 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.370
 Either but I say if the jet 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.640
 U 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.530
 I like this do enough 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 It is likely to be used outdoors 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.850
 Hmm 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.780
 This 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.130
 It may not be a two-company system for the first time 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.530
 today 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.360
 nar 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.509
 Hmm 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
 40 % 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:20.290
 3 well 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 It may be said that it is a great success, I think it can be used outdoors with this
