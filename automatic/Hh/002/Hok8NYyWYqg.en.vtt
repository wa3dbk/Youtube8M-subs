00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.160 

at<00:02:07.799> first<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.700> had<00:02:08.849> no<00:02:09.000> idea<00:02:09.390> why<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:09.720> people

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
at first we had no idea why these people

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.450 
at first we had no idea why these people
suddenly<00:02:10.800> became<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.330> country<00:02:12.690> hospital

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
suddenly became you the country hospital

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.700 
suddenly became you the country hospital
to<00:02:13.550> adequate<00:02:13.970> equipment<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.780> carry<00:02:15.020> out<00:02:15.200> tests

to adequate equipment to carry out tests

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.920 
to adequate equipment to carry out tests
so<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.580> went<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> capital<00:02:17.480> city<00:02:17.660> tomorrow
