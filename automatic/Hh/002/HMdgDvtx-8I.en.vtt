00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hi everybody, I'm a personal trainer. 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.959
 Mathias bath 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.240
 We'll start the training class. 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.549
 where we will use only one 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.150
 mattress can get you up to your carpet and 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.600
 House 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 here we go 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.119
 the first exercise will be a flexion 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.640
 which can be made with six supports or 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.950
 either with her knee on the ground only she will 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.240
 be made in a different way 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.150
 You go alternating the trunk. 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:48.350
 playing to one side and then to the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:52.430
 another counting 10 repetitions 89 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.530
 next the second exercise will be for 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.110
 work the posterior musculature of the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 thigh and abdominal 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.199
 so you raise your torso only with the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.299
 leg with support and throw arms 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.229
 arms backward making a move 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.229
 abdominal 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.560
 with this we do a good job 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.409
 very functional good working there 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.729
 several muscle groups always 10 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.590
 repetitions 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.140
 It is important to remember that you should 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.979
 repeat this for another one or two 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.979
 passages 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.229
 in this case it is also important to perform 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.210
 the other side exercise 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.880
 So we'll get up now and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.240
 perform a very nice exercise that is 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.240
 the woodpecker where you 're going to take a leg 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.640
 of the ground that fall into balance and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 trunk down 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.240
 climbing leg exchange rose leg exchange 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.280
 I'm going to have a leg 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.390
 when it comes to leg and so we will 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.390
 for ten months also 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.830
 the fourth and last exercise goes to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.430
 work lower limbs 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.500
 mainly the inner thigh region 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.330
 puts his arms forward moves 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.930
 on one leg to the side and make a move 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.820
 of knee extension flexion and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.240
 internal muscle of the leg will stay 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.240
 well tired always do the reflections 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.910

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.890
