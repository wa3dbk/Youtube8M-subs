00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 Italy is celebrating its 125th birthday this year, but almost it would be 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.499
 Mediterranean state without its typical sports cars 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.499
 The numbers are now lying in the lab serving a pound 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.539
 and that's why in sant 'Agata you have a very special surprise 525 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.789
 Birthday prepared 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.509
 The staff there simply said the best Lamberto Dini ever 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.599
 Lehmann only started 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.659
 Revolutionizing supercars world 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.560
 a big goal but the new twelve-cylinder 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.940
 The stuff might not be for everyone at first glance 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.710
 recognizable 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.860
 the revolution is playing its own 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 because the new Lamborghini is based on the principle of extreme lightweight construction 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.200
 consulted 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.570
 Engineers built most of the car from carbon fiber 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.570
 This known from the formula 1 material is extremely strong and stable 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.330
 but as light as a feather 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.740
 the workers left there as well as daily weighing 1000 575 kilograms together with 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.490
 its 700 hp afford 12 engine results in a power to weight ratio 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.750
 from just two point three kilos per horsepower this is exactly on the level 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
 one the CMK 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.289
 siepe 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.620
 twelve cylinders Siebert Tel 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.290
 Maximum speed of 3 50 km / h an acceleration 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.370
 from zero to a hundred in fabulous 2 Kor 9 seconds 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.480
 and we did it anyway 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.360
 because the co2 emission is reduced by 20 percent the transmission is quite complete 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.340
 new as very light and very emotional with it seems pages of 50 Mileys 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.760
 Seals and beyond but also the suspension completely redone 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.560
 if indeed 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 a derivative of the formula 1 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.870
 like traveling Bush Roth 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.330
 and we are the first to offer the l of these expenses in series 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.910
 shelf 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.670
 So we have already sold a lot of vehicles 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.080
 or that are available in the trade or in the trade 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 We already had shares wanted to pre-sale 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.990
 and of course that's a sensational one 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.710
 Success for the brand end of IMF in early March already in Shanghai than us 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.020
 There in the middle of April the car arrived sensational under us 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
 deliver it to our trade in the second half of the year 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.830
 even if the Aventador is up 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.000
 Racetrack gives off a really good figure Brown's Labor as before 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.639
 No
