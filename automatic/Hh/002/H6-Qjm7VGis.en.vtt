00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is pretty small compared to this monster

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.970 
is pretty small compared to this monster
I<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.820> why<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.440> don't

I don't know why see this is the I don't
here's<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> back<00:00:48.180> me<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> always<00:00:49.260> seemed<00:00:49.500> like

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
here's the back me it always seemed like

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
here's the back me it always seemed like
a<00:00:49.680> balanced<00:00:50.160> type<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.700> business<00:00:51.000> seems<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
a balanced type little business seems to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.020 
a balanced type little business seems to
have<00:00:51.449> quite<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> bit<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.379> attack<00:00:52.800> power<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
have quite a bit of attack power and it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
have quite a bit of attack power and it
has<00:00:54.149> different<00:00:54.420> modes<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.469> interesting

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
has different modes which is interesting

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
has different modes which is interesting
and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> point<00:00:57.960> car

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and I don't know but the point car

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
and I don't know but the point car
probably<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.820> part<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> maximum

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
probably not so it's part of the maximum

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
probably not so it's part of the maximum
series<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.199> basically<00:01:01.559> means<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
series and that basically means like the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
series and that basically means like the
weird<00:01:02.730> beyblades<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:04.170> pretty<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.589> most<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
weird beyblades I'm pretty sure most of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520 
weird beyblades I'm pretty sure most of
them<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.309> what's<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.450> called<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.990> can't

not a sticker and it's going to last a
lot<00:01:50.430> longer<00:01:50.540> pretty<00:01:51.540> rough<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.170> edges

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
lot longer pretty rough around the edges

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
lot longer pretty rough around the edges
probably<00:01:53.220> would<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.790> pretty<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.479> I

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
probably would be pretty good for I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
probably would be pretty good for I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and it looks pretty : it spins faster

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.639 
and it looks pretty : it spins faster
with<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> black<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.729> here<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> BD<00:02:09.300> 145<00:02:10.050> boost

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
with the black you here is BD 145 boost

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.170 
with the black you here is BD 145 boost
disc<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.819> what<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.090> called

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
disc I think that's what it's called

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.899 
disc I think that's what it's called
it<00:02:14.170> has<00:02:14.680> two<00:02:14.950> modes<00:02:15.159> for<00:02:16.000> okay<00:02:16.359> here<00:02:16.689> is<00:02:17.909> this

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
it has two modes for okay here is this

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.670 
it has two modes for okay here is this
is<00:02:19.090> boost<00:02:19.359> mode<00:02:19.629> it's<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.019> right<00:02:20.230> now<00:02:20.379> because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
is boost mode it's in right now because

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.979 
is boost mode it's in right now because
it's<00:02:20.950> higher<00:02:21.159> up<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.640> disk<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.599> then<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
it's higher up the disk but then you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's higher up the disk but then you
poke<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.069> out<00:02:24.189> then<00:02:24.459> flip<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:24.909> then<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:27.099> see

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
poke it out then flip it then it see

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.179 
poke it out then flip it then it see
it's<00:02:27.549> lower<00:02:27.790> down<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.420> ground<00:02:28.540> that's

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
it's lower down to the ground that's

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.190 
it's lower down to the ground that's
normal<00:02:30.189> mode<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.730> boost<00:02:31.599> mode<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.959> better

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
normal mode and boost mode is better

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.149 
normal mode and boost mode is better
because<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:33.010> normal<00:02:33.340> mode<00:02:33.489> adjusts<00:02:35.159> its

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
because the normal mode adjusts its

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.729 
because the normal mode adjusts its
grapes<00:02:36.489> here's<00:02:37.239> des

I've heard good things about des haven't
really<00:02:41.349> tested<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.739> out<00:02:41.859> myself<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.549> it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
really tested it out myself really it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.039 
really tested it out myself really it
seems<00:02:43.299> pretty<00:02:43.480> good<00:02:43.599> for<00:02:44.879> for<00:02:45.879> kerbecs<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:46.599> I

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
seems pretty good for for kerbecs so I

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.119
