onto<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.369> phone<00:00:32.550> application<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.100> created

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
onto my phone application so has created

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.500 
onto my phone application so has created
some<00:00:35.790> sample<00:00:36.210> number<00:00:36.480> plates<00:00:38.360> let<00:00:39.360> me

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
some sample number plates let me

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
some sample number plates let me
demonstrate<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> project<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> my

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
demonstrate this project so this is my

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.279 
demonstrate this project so this is my
app<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.530> table<00:00:48.170> which<00:00:49.399> which<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:51.289> two

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
app and a table which which got two

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.200 
app and a table which which got two
buttons<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.460> capturing<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.969> image

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
buttons one is for capturing the image

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
buttons one is for capturing the image
the<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.980> powering<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the other one is for powering off the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.979 
the other one is for powering off the
Raspberry<00:00:57.090> Pi<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.649> Raspberry<00:00:59.070> Pi<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.460> be

you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.819> on<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.939> light<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.329> this<00:03:26.510> camera

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
you can see on the light on this camera

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.610 
you can see on the light on this camera
so<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.939> means<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:29.239> capturing<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:30.290> image

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
so that means it's capturing the image

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.039 
so that means it's capturing the image
and<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.700> image<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:32.030> getting<00:03:32.480> processed<00:03:32.780> lower

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
and the image is getting processed lower

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.599 
and the image is getting processed lower
arm<00:03:34.040> level<00:03:34.340> processor<00:03:34.670> here<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.769> as<00:03:37.069> the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
arm level processor here and as the

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.220 
arm level processor here and as the
Raspberry<00:03:37.970> Pi<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.269> not<00:03:38.420> having<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.840> power<00:03:38.989> on

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
Raspberry Pi is not having the power on

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.509 
Raspberry Pi is not having the power on
button<00:03:39.379> or<00:03:39.650> power<00:03:39.859> of<00:03:39.980> button

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
button or power of button

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.770 
button or power of button
so<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:42.639> created<00:03:43.639> a<00:03:43.819> button<00:03:43.970> over<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:44.239> on<00:03:44.599> my

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
so I created a button over here on my

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.229 
so I created a button over here on my
smart<00:03:45.079> phone<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:46.310> upon<00:03:46.549> pressing<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.030> power

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
smart phone so upon pressing this power

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.940 
smart phone so upon pressing this power
button<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:48.049> then<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.260> Raspberry<00:03:48.620> Pi<00:03:48.680> will

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
button and then the Raspberry Pi will

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.479 
button and then the Raspberry Pi will
get<00:03:49.099> powered<00:03:49.609> off<00:03:54.010> thank<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.069> for<00:03:55.220> watching

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
get powered off thank you for watching

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.760 
get powered off thank you for watching
the<00:03:55.549> demo
