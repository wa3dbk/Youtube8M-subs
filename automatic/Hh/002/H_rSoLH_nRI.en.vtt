00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.520
 hello people welcome once again one 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.070
 for all of us today we are going to make a 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.080
 really easy experiment we are going to 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.110
 play to change the colors of the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.880
 liquids and it's really easy because 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.250
 we are going to use ingredients that we can 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.770
 find at home and all these fluids 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.270
 they are very easy to find and find 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:50.109
 in our houses so we're going to 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:52.149
 start and now with our liquid 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.699
 mysterious let's proceed to change 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 the colors of each of the liquids 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.030
 and as you could see we managed to change the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.530
 colors of several our liquids and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.119
 some of them were even 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.250
 transparent and now you are 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.289
 will ask what happened here and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.969
 how does this work but not what 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.829
 create all these liquids that we were 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.899
 using are liquids that you know 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.390
 they are liquids that we even drink 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.270
 using soy milk I'm using coffee 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.819
 apple juice are using lemonade 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.429
 different types of sodas and what 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.369
 happens here is that the color pigments 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.039
 that have both the juices the fabrics the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.349
 soft drinks including fruits 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.290
 natural pigments have the fruit are 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.380
 Organic substances that absorb 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.090
 certain wavelengths and refract 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 others for example we have a 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.890
 apple the apple you have is a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.690
 invention of red color that absorb all 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 the other colors and only refract 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.380
 the red and that's why we see it from 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.410
 red when we talk about refraction 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.030
 we refer to the light obviously the light 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.290
 white that the human eye perceives is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.940
 formed by the seven colors of the arch 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 iris and now we are going to talk about 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.950
 our mysterious liquid that is this 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.840
 bleach or sodium hypochlorite in 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.090
 some countries know it as chlorine 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.760
 but it's not really chlorine this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 It is diluted with hypochlorite flowers 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.690
 sodium with chlorine is a mixture and it is 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.160
 lavandina here in argentina is known 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.750
 like bleach and what does the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 bleach when we throw it in the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 liquid is to alter that structure 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.350
 molecular that have the pigments and we 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.110
 allows you to see other types of colors and how 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.150
 I know that you are one of those heads 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.640
 hard that you always want to take all 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 the experiments not this can not be 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.820
 take because they are going to ask me this 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.270
 you can not take it because you have the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.209
 Bandina do not take it if you do not take it 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.250
 yes and if you can protect and put on clothes 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.260
 adequate for this experiment better me 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.390
 I did not want to do it in this case because 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.820
 I wanted to betray that this was 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.720
 bleach but use protection wear clothes 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.340
 old and eye are not taken and if you think see 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.709
 more videos like these you can enter the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 one page for all 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.209
 soy milk there came even coffee 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.129
 we use a lot of things that we have in 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.129
 house and this is just 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.430
 in this case we have soy milk 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.380
 we had coffee we had here we had juice 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.380
 of apple we had also 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.430
 the bucket of soda all things that 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.580
 we have every day that we buy in super 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.370
 exclusive local 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.780
 although not all believe it, although not 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.520
 create all these liquids that we were 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.610
 using are liquids that we are 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.220
 accustomed even to take 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.190
 including natural pigments 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.109
 substances the pigments both the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.450
 natural as the pigments of the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.450
 fabrics the pigments of the 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.140
 a lot of fluids that are available 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.330
 easily from supermarket and that 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.700
 we even take it is not chemical 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.700
 what we are using here is chemical 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.700
 filth 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.060
 although all these liquids do not create it 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.870
 that we were using are liquid 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.870
 find them
