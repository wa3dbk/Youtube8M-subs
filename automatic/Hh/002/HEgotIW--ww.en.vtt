00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.300
 O 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 By the grace of God we seek to be 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.060
 revived by prayer today we will meditate 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.329
 to be sure that God hears the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.540
 our accepted prayers to God that has 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.250
 humble heart confident and contrite 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.039
 hear your prayers 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.340
 I saw that all the heart raised to heaven with 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.070
 faith for a sincere heart will be heard and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 attended by God and the one making the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.190
 petition will have the blessing the more of it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.210
 and often yielding to the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.970
 your expectations will not be missed 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 no prayer made with good faith 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.300
 an honest heart and a faithful saint 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.969
 the path of sincerity integrity does not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.310
 is free of obstacles but in every 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.240
 difficulty we should see a call to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 prayer 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.299
 there is no living being endowed with 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.560
 any power which it has not received from 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.299
 God and the source from which he comes 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.459
 open the weakest of human beings to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.079
 ascend to the throne of god to his 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:33.240
 sincere and humble prayers of the sinner 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.810
 Christ mixes with it the merits of his 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.569
 own life and perfect obedience and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.270
 incense lends fragrance to our 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:46.469
 Christ's prayers has pledged to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.389
 intercede on our behalf and the father always 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.149
 there was to the son 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.609
 God's answers are not always the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.630
 We hope but you always 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.669
 responds 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.249
 even if we do not realize that these 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:05.359
 concepts are based on the journal 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:08.390
