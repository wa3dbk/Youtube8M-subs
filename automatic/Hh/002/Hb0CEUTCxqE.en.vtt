00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.950
 good morning first and obviously 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 already have some of this model the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.150
 messerschmitt 109 rebuilt and want 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.880
 Now you know how to do it all 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 I can well connected 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 I would have to understand the beginning 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.650
 same problems and therefore occur 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.240
 this video for info the whole 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 Shaping the way we have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.039
 before the engine of the three cables 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.779
 depart 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 These three cables are connected directly to the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 connected computer as you can see 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 go from the regulator also three cables 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 long play the colors in the case 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 not matter 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 so it would not pay attention to what 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.170
 but you should absolutely pay attention 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.700
 that the two middle cables 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 necessarily come together from both 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 regulator as well as the engine the two 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.309
 other cables can be so and so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 infected that does not matter first 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.039
 the first and only determine the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.559
 Direction of rotation of the engine that is when 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.510
 one puts the cables on wrong way 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 so in this case the red and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 black 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 then the engine may turn into the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.619
 wrong direction and to fix it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 Just pass the two cables over 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.540
 stuck that is the black after 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070
 here and the red after a whole 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.299
 simple story so far 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.100
 on the other side have the plug 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.780
 for the battery is the battery that will be 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.329
 simply connected that is as far as clear 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.390
 I think and then this is going on 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.820
 cable long form regulator is the receiver 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.079
 an ordinary plug the gr 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 By the way, all the servus in sometimes too 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.280
 and to connect the whole thing you have to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.649
 just plug in the pinzi 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 where I have to say that from receiver 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.820
 to the receiver 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.320
 the channel assignment will be different 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.509
 That's why you have to be there more or 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.880
 less by fummel until the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:07.180
 finds right slots 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.989
 the green plugs have such a front 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.630
 small grading that you can see it 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.120
 can 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:25.870
 they are so strangely flattened in two 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:28.890
 Corner so you can not be pursued 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.890
 you look a little bad 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.470
 if you just plug it 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.739
 Look closer and you will 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.840
 realize that he is in two corners 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.709
 flattened here are no phase 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.160
 turn and she just provides for that 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.790
 you have about the clue 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 currency the plug must be plugged 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.260
 if you make the ban then the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.750
 water lily quite a weird noise as if 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.069
 constantly switching through 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.450
 that's a sure sign 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.550
 that the plug is the wrong way round 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.730
 then in the case and stronger again 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.730
 rausnehmen and 180 degrees again infected 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.760
 as I said 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.160
 because of the cable allocation you have to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 if you want to know that by 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.700
 height or just does not respond 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.250
 but for that claire or may one 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 simply both against each other 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.560
 is the plug occupancy for the fair 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.769
 or is then just on the occupancy 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.959
 from the rudder and vice versa as well and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.959
 already fits the settings actually 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.590
 then the question was asked how 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.500
 me across or around the chicken or with 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.780
 connected to the servus that sees 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.720
 From here you can see the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.670
 across or very well 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.850
 and here goes this rod long 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.540
 This controlware is easy with 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.540
 epoxy resin attached in this or 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:27.900
 very stable and stuck here again 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.660
 screwed this screw connection 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:36.050
 you get at konrad I think of 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:43.140
 Tens pack for three euros or so much 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:46.000
 practically connect the whole and 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.080
 the elevator is connected as well 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.630
 So here is the servo then running 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.910
 here from the servo rod too long 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.820
 this horn control 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:04.540
 he is also direct with epoxy resin 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.880
 glued to brother and to the 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:21.040
 same way connected 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:22.540
 quite simply that looks like I connect 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.060
 times the engine resp 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:32.290
 First you should always the sender 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:41.320
 turn on and then the regulator with the 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:48.130
 battery link this noise from 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:54.610
 Regulator is a feedback that the 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:55.840
 Renner sits in the right channel and the 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.060
 scooters should then do the following 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.470
 function 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.330
 Let's take the chicken or if you can 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.080
 follow the lever on the right side 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.790
 pulls down 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:18.520
 then he should go up or up 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:19.830
 you can see the lever against it 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.120
 up 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.350
 then the elevator hits down 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.630
 out and at the cross or behave that 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.380
 This is how you strike the lever 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.020
 to the left 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:38.390
 then it's more discrete on the left 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.960
 speak up and walk to the right 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.900
 including and one looks up in fog 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:51.380
 right out then that goes right transverse 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.830
 or high and the left down so far 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.770
 clear 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:00.680
 the engine will be over 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.010
 this lever here just serves 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:10.090
 prefer 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:14.540
 then turn off and optional 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.610
 is there still this lever for that 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.530
 rudder which I do not use 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.530
 this is also to fly at all 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:27.050
 not necessary that is why this is eliminated 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:29.960
 function completely so that is so 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.190
 as far as the description I hope so 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.190
 that it is sufficient 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:42.850
 good people then try your luck like that 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.810
 hard it actually is not I 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.520
 somehow series on 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.120
 got 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.889
 without instructions and I wish you still 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.889
 Good luck until then
