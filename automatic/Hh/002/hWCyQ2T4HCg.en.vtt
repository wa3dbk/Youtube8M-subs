00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 all boys and welcome back on those two 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.180
 on the server 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.890
 2 we continue with the blogs since there is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
 like them and since we like them 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 because they take no time to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.710
 unlike other videos that bore us 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 we really make an ass like one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.580
 hoe but these videos we need for 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.380
 clarify some concepts that often 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 we also express during reviews 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 but for problems of time 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 we express a little on the fly I would go back up 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.170
 a game that we treated a bit of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 long ago 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 I would stay there again because that boys game is 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 a game so we want today 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 talk to you about games in us today we would like 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.290
 talking about indie games but I don't think so 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.800
 the case of starting from the pet 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 sure every day and thuram the name of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 taylor the hills are therefore 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.920
 indie the third developers are 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 second less addicts are two songs 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.480
 I don't know how many people use it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 both the chard surely make of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.030
 hallucinogenic mushrooms really people that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.609
 licks his ears though anyway 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 boys the indie market a 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.239
 market which is very interesting because 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 if on one side it is made up of little ones 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.400
 small business developers on the other 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 it is made by people who are not pressured by 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 production as one can have it from I know 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 even an infinity ward does indeed 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 we have seen several for example 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.340
 campaigns and indigo rather than 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.680
 kickstarter for games that are born from 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.280
 low that is born of the people from 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.770
 guys who would like to see them 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.470
 very surprisingly developed and finished 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.110
 some of these titles are very ugly and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.770
 useless others this is the bulk 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.630
 indie problem but we don't find 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 no difference between the market 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 mainstream and the market in why 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.479
 even among the big titled bug titles 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.220
 faces that don't play gameplay 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.080
 worsened errors that are there for ten 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.120
 years gone 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 you guys are fixed you know that you 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.960
 let's say there will also be institutions 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.790
 disgusting because there are however in the market 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.650
 in you can have a surprise every now and then 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.280
 you can have a surprise and we are 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.760
 having so many it is enough to think of the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 fact that I personally didn't play 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.160
 he didn't play a good story at play 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.430
 like that of to the moon for years 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.640
 really since the 90s another bit 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.290
 Exactly and these are things that we do 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.150
 like to let you know why ours 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.390
 review on the moon had its own 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.370
 that purpose, that is, to let you know it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.490
 but you guys don't leave wine 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.500
 drive only by us or just by doing 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
 we are not talking about video games that came 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.760
 find out why you are looking for them too 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.980
 so many that maybe we don't 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.600
 we can try them all but you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 you can find the very ones in di 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.290
 which is fantastic and possibly one 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.290
 Once you find it let us know that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.850
 we touch it yes among the ios tools 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.720
 you can also use ours 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.480
 place 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.670
 because all of us guys are 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.060
 commit to writing daily 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.269
 precisely on ps.it there are titles that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.030
 often before we read from da 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.920
 they still tell us inside 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.090
 let us point out some conversations 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.940
 private we do 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.280
 and then we say they come to the great 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.400
 public also thanks to our work 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.470
 Exactly however you are going to give 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.410
 look at the site because there are so many 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.360
 games we told the boys talk 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.330
 of the games you like not those 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.130
 strafamosi those who speak all 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.640
 there are guys who have us 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.800
 really stupid ie guys with 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.260
 whole libraries 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.700
 we talk about hundreds of games only 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.570
 in between which said I would leave 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 right there where, however, it is still 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.040
 boys is a market that is worth 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.740
 explore and also know why a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.210
 market often and willingly 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.330
 very cheap yes the beautiful thing is that 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.460
 than with a thick with a coffee or a 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.530
 breakfast and go buy a 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.120
 little trick that maybe entertains you for 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.120
 2 3 4 10 hours
