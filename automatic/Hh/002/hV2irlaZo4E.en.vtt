looked at all the images of the maps in
detail<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> Encore<00:01:32.729> map<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
detail and on the Encore map it kind of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.520 
detail and on the Encore map it kind of
looks<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> somebody<00:01:33.960> putting<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
looks like this somebody putting down a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.429 
looks like this somebody putting down a
bipod<00:01:35.100> weapon<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:35.729> an<00:01:35.939> LMG<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> sniper<00:01:37.200> if

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
bipod weapon maybe an LMG or a sniper if

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.990 
bipod weapon maybe an LMG or a sniper if
it's<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.710> lmg<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.520> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> hard<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's as lmg then it's kind of hard to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.039 
it's as lmg then it's kind of hard to
tell<00:01:39.090> whether<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.479> already<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> game

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
tell whether it's already in the game

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
tell whether it's already in the game
but<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.890> sniper<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> looks<00:01:42.119> new

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
but if it's sniper it kind of looks new

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
but if it's sniper it kind of looks new
but<00:01:42.479> i'm<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.350> sure<00:01:43.530> why<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.829> wouldn't

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
but i'm not sure why they wouldn't

vertigo<00:01:58.380> looks<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
vertigo looks like it's gonna be on the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.830 
vertigo looks like it's gonna be on the
top<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> some<00:02:00.030> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> building<00:02:00.600> some

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
top of some kind of building some

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
top of some kind of building some
skyscraper<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.500> something<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
skyscraper or something that you see a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
skyscraper or something that you see a
helipad<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> tops<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> be

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
helipad at the tops it's going to be

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
helipad at the tops it's going to be
pretty<00:02:03.930> high<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> looks<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.549> high

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
pretty high up kind of looks like high

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.520 
pretty high up kind of looks like high
rise<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.509> could<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:06.899> fun<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.380> map

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
rise so it could be really fun that map

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
rise so it could be really fun that map
hope<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.009> quite<00:02:08.250> small<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.700> well<00:02:08.849> compact

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
hope it's quite small as well compact

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.240 
hope it's quite small as well compact
just<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> high-rise<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.800> i<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:10.860> like

that<00:02:11.280> map<00:02:11.610> also<00:02:12.239> magma<00:02:12.840> looks<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> set

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that map also magma looks like a set

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
that map also magma looks like a set
city<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> course<00:02:14.430> magma<00:02:14.910> linked<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.480> fire<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
city of course magma linked to fire that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.210 
city of course magma linked to fire that
kind<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.500> stuff<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.160> of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
kind of stuff is going to be a lot of

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
kind of stuff is going to be a lot of
burning<00:02:17.760> down<00:02:17.910> rubble<00:02:18.450> buildings<00:02:19.140> things

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
burning down rubble buildings things

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.530 
burning down rubble buildings things
like<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.849> bit<00:02:21.000> different<00:02:21.420> well

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
like that a little bit different well

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.970 
like that a little bit different well
I'm<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.690> sure<00:02:21.750> whether<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.170> sounds<00:02:22.500> too<00:02:22.709> fun

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
I'm not sure whether it sounds too fun

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.130 
I'm not sure whether it sounds too fun
studio<00:02:23.730> i'm<00:02:23.849> really<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.270> sure<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:24.569> corey's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
studio i'm really not sure about corey's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.960 
studio i'm really not sure about corey's
tell<00:02:25.410> much<00:02:25.650> about<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> picture<00:02:26.790> but

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
tell much about that in the picture but

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.699 
tell much about that in the picture but
what<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.239> really<00:02:27.450> interesting<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:28.200> actually

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
what is really interesting is actually

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.559 
what is really interesting is actually
the<00:02:28.830> zombies<00:02:29.160> not<00:02:29.190> mob<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.700> dead<00:02:29.819> in<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the zombies not mob of the dead in the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.180 
the zombies not mob of the dead in the
background<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.230> son<00:02:31.500> who<00:02:31.709> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.069> see

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
background on that son who kind of see

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.400 
background on that son who kind of see
it<00:02:32.250> says<00:02:32.489> alcatraz<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.200> map<00:02:34.380> is

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
it says alcatraz and so if this map is

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.320 
it says alcatraz and so if this map is
set<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:34.830> Alcatraz<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> prison

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
set on Alcatraz with all the prison

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.729 
set on Alcatraz with all the prison
camps<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> things<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.349> think<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
camps and things like that I think that

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.990 
camps and things like that I think that
would<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.920> absolutely<00:02:38.250> awesome<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.849> think

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
would be absolutely awesome I think

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.790 
would be absolutely awesome I think
that's<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.209> cool<00:02:39.690> idea<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.620> just

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
that's a really cool idea and I just

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
that's a really cool idea and I just
think<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.069> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> Awesome<00:02:41.849> setting

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
think that's kind of Awesome setting

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.970 
think that's kind of Awesome setting
that<00:02:42.269> kind<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.540> setting<00:02:43.019> they've<00:02:43.830> already

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that kind of setting they've already

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.410 
that kind of setting they've already
said<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.400> gonna<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> scary

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
said it's gonna be like one of the scary

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.000 
said it's gonna be like one of the scary
so<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.720> think<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.080> said<00:02:46.200> actually<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> scary

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so I think that said actually the scary

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.789 
so I think that said actually the scary
zombies<00:02:47.670> experience<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.330> date<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
zombies experience to date and so I

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.110 
zombies experience to date and so I
really<00:02:50.069> hope<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.760> kind<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
really hope the go for that kind of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.509 
really hope the go for that kind of
thriller<00:02:51.480> murderer<00:02:52.049> kinda<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:53.100> sounds<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> bit

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
thriller murderer kinda it sounds a bit

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.370 
thriller murderer kinda it sounds a bit
weird<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.390> know<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.720> sounds<00:02:55.019> pretty<00:02:55.110> cool

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
weird but you know it sounds pretty cool

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.080 
weird but you know it sounds pretty cool
so<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> whole<00:02:56.130> if<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.519> leak<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.000> be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
so on the whole if this leak is to be

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.460 
so on the whole if this leak is to be
believed<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.690> really<00:02:57.989> jump<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.440> joy

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
believed I'm not really jump for joy

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.530 
believed I'm not really jump for joy
about<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.069> matter<00:02:59.220> pack<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> mean<00:02:59.730> vertigo

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
and studio they sound pretty cool but

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.949 
and studio they sound pretty cool but
the<00:03:02.220> other<00:03:02.340> multiplayer<00:03:02.610> maps<00:03:02.970> I'm<00:03:03.209> really

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the other multiplayer maps I'm really

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.900 
the other multiplayer maps I'm really
not<00:03:04.140> sure<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.440> until<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> played<00:03:05.190> them<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
not sure about until I played them the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.850 
not sure about until I played them the
zombies<00:03:06.360> map<00:03:06.510> however<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.930> am<00:03:07.049> excited<00:03:07.170> that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
zombies map however I am excited that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.350 
zombies map however I am excited that
I'm<00:03:07.980> always<00:03:08.160> excited<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:08.760> zombies<00:03:09.030> am<00:03:09.150> always

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
I'm always excited for zombies am always

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.870 
I'm always excited for zombies am always
up<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.190> sat<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.489> Alcatraz

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
up for that and if it is sat on Alcatraz

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
up for that and if it is sat on Alcatraz
think<00:03:12.090> I'd<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.269> really<00:03:12.480> fun<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.650> really

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
think I'd be really fun and a really

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.400 
think I'd be really fun and a really
cool<00:03:14.160> spin<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.580> things<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.900> overall

cool spin on things so you know overall

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.380 
cool spin on things so you know overall
I<00:03:16.440> think<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.860> could<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.069> interesting<00:03:17.609> but<00:03:18.150> no

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
I think it could be interesting but no

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.000 
I think it could be interesting but no
DLC<00:03:18.900> weapon<00:03:19.049> that's<00:03:19.380> kind<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> bit<00:03:19.859> of<00:03:19.950> a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
DLC weapon that's kind of a bit of a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.729
