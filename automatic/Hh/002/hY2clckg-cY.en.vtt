an<00:02:11.260> offset<00:02:11.560> pat<00:02:12.310> boone<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.150> we're<00:02:13.330> gonna<00:02:13.420> have

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
an offset pat boone so we're gonna have

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.650 
an offset pat boone so we're gonna have
an<00:02:13.870> accent<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.590> e<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:15.220> two<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
an accent on the e of two and on the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.750 
an accent on the e of two and on the
downbeat<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.200> three<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.129> we<00:02:18.250> counted<00:02:18.640> all

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
downbeat of three so if we counted all

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.970 
downbeat of three so if we counted all
that<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.269> clapped<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> would<00:02:19.989> be<00:02:20.170> four<00:02:20.799> E

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that and clapped it it would be four E

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.789 
that and clapped it it would be four E
and<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.760> E<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.450> two<00:02:22.480> E<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.930> A<00:02:23.440> three<00:02:23.470> E

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
and a one E and a two E and A three E

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.729 
and a one E and a two E and A three E
and<00:02:24.190> a--<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.670> then<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.720> Debby<00:02:26.019> Boone<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
and a-- and then for the Debby Boone the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
split part of it the Debby Boone comes

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.410 
split part of it the Debby Boone comes
at<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.599> end<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:29.410> gonna<00:02:29.620> simply<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.340> four<00:02:31.000> E

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
at the end it's gonna simply be four E

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
at the end it's gonna simply be four E
and<00:02:31.769> now<00:02:32.769> we're<00:02:32.920> gonna<00:02:33.010> play<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.310> skeleton<00:02:33.880> of

and now we're gonna play a skeleton of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.509 
and now we're gonna play a skeleton of
sixteenth<00:02:34.450> notes<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.470> play<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.739> accent

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
sixteenth notes and just play the accent

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.890 
sixteenth notes and just play the accent
pattern<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.269> can<00:02:37.450> hear<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
pattern so that we can hear what that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:59.479 
pattern so that we can hear what that
sounds<00:02:38.049> like

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.280 

now<00:03:00.489> that's<00:03:00.700> step<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.269> step<00:03:01.630> two<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:02.079> going<00:03:02.230> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
now that's step one step two is going to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.199 
now that's step one step two is going to
be<00:03:02.440> actually<00:03:02.859> apply<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.340> pattern<00:03:03.700> where<00:03:04.180> it

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
be actually apply the pattern where it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.270 
be actually apply the pattern where it
will<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.600> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> drum<00:03:05.230> set<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.980> I'm<00:03:06.160> gonna

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
will go on the drum set so I'm gonna

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.069 
will go on the drum set so I'm gonna

they're just a memory tool is all they
are<00:03:23.950> they're<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.400> learning<00:03:24.760> tool<00:03:24.940> so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
are they're just a learning tool so

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.140 
are they're just a learning tool so
we're<00:03:25.720> gonna<00:03:25.810> have<00:03:26.079> Pat<00:03:26.440> Boone<00:03:27.160> then<00:03:27.880> we<00:03:28.000> have

we're doing is we're working on our

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800 
we're doing is we're working on our
transitions<00:05:01.400> all<00:05:01.580> too<00:05:01.910> often<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.300> get<00:05:02.479> into<00:05:02.780> a

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
transitions all too often I get into a

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.350 
transitions all too often I get into a
gig<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.919> it's<00:05:04.460> not<00:05:04.640> that<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:04.820> can't<00:05:05.060> play<00:05:05.210> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
gig and it's not that I can't play the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.060 
gig and it's not that I can't play the
groove<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:06.110> can't<00:05:06.320> put<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.560> pattern<00:05:06.800> for

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
groove and I can't put the pattern for

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.350 
groove and I can't put the pattern for
the<00:05:07.160> fill<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.490> I'm<00:05:07.610> trying<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.910> play<00:05:08.120> it's

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
the fill that I'm trying to play it's

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.940 
the fill that I'm trying to play it's
that<00:05:08.540> I<00:05:08.570> can't<00:05:08.690> do<00:05:09.080> them<00:05:09.290> all<00:05:09.440> together<00:05:09.680> I

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
that I can't do them all together I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.010 
that I can't do them all together I
can't<00:05:10.220> do<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.460> transition<00:05:10.910> so<00:05:11.450> it<00:05:11.570> hangs<00:05:11.780> me

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
can't do the transition so it hangs me

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.630 
can't do the transition so it hangs me
up<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.320> whenever<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.620> come<00:05:12.860> out<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.430> I

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
up and whenever I come out of that I

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.820 
up and whenever I come out of that I
kind<00:05:14.030> of<00:05:14.120> stumble<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.110> couple<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.560> beats

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
kind of stumble for a couple of beats

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.040 
kind of stumble for a couple of beats
before<00:05:15.950> we<00:05:16.430> settle<00:05:16.880> back<00:05:17.030> into<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:17.870> let's

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
before we settle back into that so let's

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.750 
before we settle back into that so let's
work<00:05:18.200> on<00:05:18.380> our<00:05:18.470> transitions<00:05:19.160> during<00:05:19.669> our

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
work on our transitions during our

00:05:19.760 --> 00:06:07.210 
work on our transitions during our
practice<00:05:19.940> time<00:05:20.390> as<00:05:20.570> well

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.580 

and<00:06:08.720> that's<00:06:09.720> all<00:06:09.930> there<00:06:10.110> is<00:06:10.230> to<00:06:10.440> this

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
and that's all there is to this

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.520 
and that's all there is to this
practical<00:06:11.190> fill<00:06:11.430> learn<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.360> fill<00:06:12.570> step<00:06:12.990> 1<00:06:13.350> in

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
practical fill learn the fill step 1 in

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.430 
practical fill learn the fill step 1 in
its<00:06:13.740> skeleton<00:06:14.310> format<00:06:14.900> step<00:06:15.900> 2

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
its skeleton format step 2

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.650 
its skeleton format step 2
is<00:06:16.500> take<00:06:16.980> that<00:06:17.250> fill<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.850> put<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.180> actually<00:06:18.480> on

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
is take that fill and put it actually on

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.420 
is take that fill and put it actually on

go<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.639> step<00:06:21.540> 3<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.169> take<00:06:22.950> away<00:06:23.130> those<00:06:23.430> ghost

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
go to step 3 is take away those ghost
