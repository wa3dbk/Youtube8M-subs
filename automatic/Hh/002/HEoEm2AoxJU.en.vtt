installed<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.879> data<00:04:03.419> about<00:04:03.780> two<00:04:04.019> weeks<00:04:04.229> ago<00:04:04.379> so

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
installed a data about two weeks ago so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.499 
installed a data about two weeks ago so
they<00:04:05.009> sent<00:04:05.280> us<00:04:05.400> one<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.699> their<00:04:05.819> first<00:04:06.030> samples

they sent us one of their first samples

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.210 
they sent us one of their first samples
and<00:04:06.689> we<00:04:06.780> actually<00:04:07.139> killed<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:07.919> we

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and we actually killed it because we

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.849 
and we actually killed it because we
thought<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.639> was<00:04:08.729> waterproof<00:04:09.379> it<00:04:10.379> turns<00:04:10.650> out

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
thought it was waterproof it turns out

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.659 
thought it was waterproof it turns out
that<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:12.540> device<00:04:13.199> itself<00:04:13.709> overall<00:04:14.400> is

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
that the the device itself overall is

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.899 
that the the device itself overall is
waterproof<00:04:15.229> but<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:16.829> open<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.669> water

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
waterproof but with this open the water

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.689 
waterproof but with this open the water
does<00:04:18.269> seep<00:04:18.599> through<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.310> inside<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.579> they

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
does seep through and inside and they

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.850 
does seep through and inside and they
will<00:04:20.880> ruin<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.419> hard<00:04:21.599> drive<00:04:21.870> so<00:04:22.469> it<00:04:22.740> is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
will ruin the hard drive so it is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.350 
will ruin the hard drive so it is
waterproof<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.610> know<00:04:23.729> if<00:04:23.849> you're<00:04:24.000> working<00:04:24.150> on

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.089 
waterproof you know if you're working on
you<00:04:24.570> drop<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.169> puddle<00:04:25.469> or<00:04:25.560> something<00:04:25.889> but

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
you drop it in a puddle or something but

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.200 
you drop it in a puddle or something but
just<00:04:26.130> make<00:04:26.430> sure<00:04:26.460> this

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
just make sure this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.960 
just make sure this

using crystal disk bike 2.2 we will

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.760 
using crystal disk bike 2.2 we will
fast-forward<00:05:00.330> through<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.139> results<00:05:01.500> you

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
fast-forward through the results you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.749 
fast-forward through the results you
don't<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:02.009> to<00:05:02.130> sit<00:05:02.310> through<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.610> whole

don't have to sit through the whole

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.850 
don't have to sit through the whole
thing<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.120> then<00:05:03.570> we'll<00:05:03.810> summarize<00:05:04.500> the

thing and then we'll summarize the

thing and then we'll summarize the
results<00:05:05.340> at<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.460> end<00:05:05.580> once<00:05:06.000> it's<00:05:06.210> finished

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.800 

okay<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.550> benchmarks<00:05:54.090> just<00:05:54.270> came<00:05:54.480> to<00:05:54.690> the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
okay the benchmarks just came to the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.030 
okay the benchmarks just came to the
completion<00:05:55.620> here<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:56.250> we<00:05:56.460> can<00:05:56.730> see<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:58.040> read

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
completion here and we can see a read

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.520 
completion here and we can see a read

to<00:06:01.620> write<00:06:01.800> speed<00:06:02.130> of<00:06:02.280> around<00:06:02.370> 15<00:06:02.970> megabytes

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
to write speed of around 15 megabytes

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.250 
to write speed of around 15 megabytes
per<00:06:03.540> second<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.710> 512k<00:06:05.610> around<00:06:06.540> 15

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
per second on the 512k around 15

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.410 
per second on the 512k around 15
megabytes<00:06:07.650> per<00:06:07.830> second<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.030> write<00:06:09.240> is

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
megabytes per second and the write is

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.900 
megabytes per second and the write is
about<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.780> same<00:06:10.050> okay<00:06:10.890> not<00:06:11.130> so<00:06:11.340> good<00:06:11.640> about<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
about the same okay not so good about a

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.880 
about the same okay not so good about a
half<00:06:12.090> a<00:06:12.120> megabyte<00:06:12.570> per<00:06:12.780> second<00:06:13.200> and<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.440> riots

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
half a megabyte per second and the riots

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.090 
half a megabyte per second and the riots
at<00:06:14.070> around<00:06:14.310> 1.2<00:06:15.210> megabytes<00:06:15.660> per<00:06:15.930> second<00:06:16.500> so

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
at around 1.2 megabytes per second so

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.190 
at around 1.2 megabytes per second so
the<00:06:17.250> performance<00:06:17.790> here<00:06:18.090> we<00:06:18.510> are<00:06:18.540> testing<00:06:19.020> on<00:06:19.140> a

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
the performance here we are testing on a

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.840 
the performance here we are testing on a
slightly<00:06:19.470> older<00:06:19.830> laptop<00:06:20.250> but<00:06:20.370> it's<00:06:20.490> not<00:06:20.640> too

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
slightly older laptop but it's not too

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.060 
slightly older laptop but it's not too
old<00:06:21.000> performance<00:06:21.990> not<00:06:22.380> as<00:06:22.650> good<00:06:22.830> as<00:06:22.920> we

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
old performance not as good as we

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.060 
old performance not as good as we
expected<00:06:23.670> but<00:06:24.210> this<00:06:24.690> this<00:06:25.050> device<00:06:25.500> is<00:06:25.770> not<00:06:25.920> so

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
expected but this this device is not so

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.440 
expected but this this device is not so
much<00:06:26.160> about<00:06:26.340> speed<00:06:26.880> but<00:06:27.120> it's<00:06:27.240> about

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
much about speed but it's about

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.180 
much about speed but it's about
durability<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.590> there's<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:28.890> bit<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.100> a

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
durability so there's a bit of a

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.650 
durability so there's a bit of a
trade-off<00:06:29.460> here<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.940> you<00:06:30.030> pay<00:06:30.240> for<00:06:30.450> it<00:06:30.540> by

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
trade-off here that you pay for it by

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.660 
trade-off here that you pay for it by
the<00:06:30.720> looks<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.080> things<00:06:31.320> so<00:06:31.980> our<00:06:32.250> final

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
the looks of things so our final

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.320 
the looks of things so our final
thoughts<00:06:32.850> for<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.300> $1<00:06:33.660> spot<00:06:34.170> sh<00:06:34.590> 93<00:06:35.430> we<00:06:36.060> love
