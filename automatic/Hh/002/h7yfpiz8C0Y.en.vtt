00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.110
 that is silver that is the trilogy 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.210
 title because the protagonist thus 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 surname has the german father 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.809
 and that means silver with last names 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.030
 and I just had that title 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.530
 create this silver and then comes the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.330
 subtitles at the first book extreme 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.809
 little dream and then the first book of the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.040
 dreams 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.600
 if you calculate yourself like that 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.930
 next hot second third book of the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.559
 dreams 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.000
 but I was not so clear what this 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.190
 meaning of silver was and i would have 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.100
 a dream right in the coming night 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.620
 from the friends we were on 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.760
 a meadow sat on an old-fashioned 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.130
 carousel 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 I know exactly what they had and then 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.830
 in the dream said silver is a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.020
 great title 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.070
 he fits so well because with consecrated ones 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.659
 silver balls you defeated the evil and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.430
 then I woke up and knew that 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.620
 that's exactly how this friend has that 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.310
 I said you have me today 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.070
 some space 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.510
 I want such a brainstorm first 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.030
 Gift that is actually one 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.920
 ambiguous name is because you are one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 Lift actually solves in every book 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.530
 you can do a supernatural case 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.390
 say and you the evil if you are exact 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
 takes like a silver ball just one 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.900
 consecrated silver ball throws misses 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.960
 and similar but who does how much 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.330
 not in my book and then I have 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 she had in the dream of the season with 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.810
 star on it and then I have her 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.730
 just bought a book for and whole 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 This dream comes true when sent to the animal 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.850
 I thought that was it again 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.860
 For example, because that often then you press 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.230
 When writing that is that while you are 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.820
 of writing suddenly things real 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.080
 you can only be in advance 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 invented and was so again 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.459
 nice example of that too 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.459
 These dreams are of his power
