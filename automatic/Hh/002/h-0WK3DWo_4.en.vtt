00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
they wanted to get off the island

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.319 
they wanted to get off the island
because<00:01:35.970> Noah<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.509> falling<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> their

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
because Noah was falling and their

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.910 
because Noah was falling and their
captain<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.659> trying<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> kill<00:01:40.500> him<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.860> that

captain was trying to kill him for that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
captain was trying to kill him for that
but<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> coolest<00:01:41.549> thing<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> see

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
but the coolest thing is we got to see

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.380 
but the coolest thing is we got to see
Brooks's<00:01:43.290> new<00:01:43.560> ability<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.520> his<00:01:44.700> sword<00:01:45.119> he

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
Brooks's new ability with his sword he

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.350 
Brooks's new ability with his sword he
could<00:01:45.540> freeze<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.470> which<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> kind<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
could freeze things now which is kind of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.639 
could freeze things now which is kind of
cool<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.630> guess<00:01:48.899> he<00:01:49.020> could<00:01:49.140> freeze<00:01:49.350> things

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
cool I guess he could freeze things

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
cool I guess he could freeze things
because<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> soul<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.329> very<00:01:51.600> cold

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
because you know the soul is very cold

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
because you know the soul is very cold
cuz<00:01:52.350> he<00:01:52.439> said<00:01:52.619> anything<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.280> cut<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:53.820> become

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
cuz he said anything I cut will become

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
cuz he said anything I cut will become
as<00:01:54.329> cold<00:01:54.689> as<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> sold<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.770> something<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.130> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
as cold as a sold or something like that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.980 
as cold as a sold or something like that
I<00:01:56.340> forget<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.000> said<00:01:57.270> exactly<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:57.899> that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I forget what it said exactly but that's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.780 
I forget what it said exactly but that's
what<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> reason<00:01:59.130> why<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.520> could

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
what I think is the reason why you could

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.100 
what I think is the reason why you could
freeze<00:02:00.000> things<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.600> other<00:02:00.780> than<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
freeze things but other than that I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.920 
freeze things but other than that I
