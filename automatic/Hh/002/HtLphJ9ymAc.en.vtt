00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.519
 to 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.850
 we live in this special 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.950
 end here in jump follows diego durruty 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.290
 live Corsican magazine and we add 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.610
 alicia queen the first woman in the 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.380
 history of argentina that are 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.200
 driving is the woman speak Chinese 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.900
 but from navigator galicia we just 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.820
 asked God is true hallucinations 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 and we said and it happens well and what it consists 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 this drug we passed very badly to be 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.760
 really a very hard day 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.460
 To top it, we can the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.100
 We had 5 liters of water dropped 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.399
 so we had stayed 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 we had run out of water and it really is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 exasperating because we had one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 little bottle 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 and well with that we did not do anything and I 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.610
 I got a little desperation 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 I needed to wet my head because I did not 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.580
 no no really 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.960
 if you have to remember an image up 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630
 now this dakar to an image you 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.579
 surprised 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.670
 what would it be because they are spoken in many 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.490
 accidents already of a dead pilot two 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 journalists also died if this 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.670
 Really 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.590
 I still do not tell you why 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.200
 out there good reporters the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.469
 we knew 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.350
 and the pilot really does one come or go 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.570
 to prepare for beyond that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.869
 we know it's hard to live a 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.770
 really beautiful and good experience 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.960
 these things happen without a doubt that they hurt a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.929
 bunch but some that you called the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.510
 attention what I saw burning cars two 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.610
 cars 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.400
 and then if it did not impress me much yesterday 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.600
 see many cars stopped just like 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.170
 ATVs Motorcycle motorcycle when 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.910
 48 later that did surprise me 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 quite does it to yesterday's image 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.930
 from the heat from the full sun from 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.490
 the high temperature and that in this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 dakar maybe does not coincide so much in the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.090
 routes the cars the trucks with the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.230
 four-wheelers and with the bikes that's why 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.780
 a safety issue was decided 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.320
 just make this kind of decision and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.730
 alice and at the moment when it is a vehicle 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.500
 burned or an accident what is it that 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.910
 a pilot passes through his head 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.910
 has the goal of reaching the goal 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.400
 I believe that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.049
 you look for the goal in this you have to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.049
 be cold beyond what 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.820
 well those are material damage and you 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.310
 I repeat again one prepares all the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.560
 year and this is very expensive but good 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.070
 we know that it is part of this as the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.070
 Leave 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.430
 no doubt you're sorry to see such a thing 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.800
 It is very sad to hear on the day of 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.590
 rest make up we painted the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.599
 nails something nothing or sleep nothing good 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.880
 tomorrow let's rest let's try 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.819
 to rest because I really have 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:19.019
 asleep a bit this we come lengthening 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:21.410
 from behind and if the night we also arrived 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.650
 we too late 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.540
 it's also good for us so 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.260
 good every day we bet very 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.850
 late and we got up very early 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.610
 and of fire of not walking all day and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.230
 really exhausting in some day 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.280
 you imagined that he left his said here 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.280
 the dakar is finished 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.790
 and today just 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.190
 I see that he came to paradise apart 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.640
 I trust a lot in the person who leads 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.190
 side that is dante really is iron 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.410
 I have to admit that dante is from 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.540
 iron because he solves everything 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.810
 always always predisposed to 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.760
 forward and well really that gives you 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.000
 they give a lot of strength but good today we are going to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.120
 lengthen the stage and the truck had 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.850
 one failure without a doubt that we stopped this 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.590
 Dante reviewed one thing to the other but 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.630
 well we could not find the fault 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.320
 and we did not arrive we arrived very 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.890
 delayed 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.740
 this one yes we continue the same trip very 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.660
 slowly the truck stopped us and 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.240
 let's try to get there 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.450
 and well in a moment it came back down 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.330
 in front of the truck and found the 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.660
 fails and we could get to lengthen in that 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.390
 moment if I did not imagine by the dakar 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.100
 I say no it can not be that we leave 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.320
 we have to get this I think that the 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.610
 two we are putting everything to 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.280
 to be able to turn around that is our 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.230
 objective and good and in whatever the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.600
 truck they are leaving you are going to 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.130
 solve as it is but it is alicia the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.860
 sports theme 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.000
 nani roma proves that it is one of the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.790
 great candidates despite 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.240
 peterhansel today hear today but it is 33 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.280
 minutes but you have to highlight a lot 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.490
 that said about orly newfoundland second 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.890
 there, very expectant, I imagine that he 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.110
 had other goals but having there the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.580
 victory or the first place so close to 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.990
 outside a little in the head like 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.820
 surely not but good now what 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.470
 comes I think that this stage of which 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.420
 we passed the dakar outside the most 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.580
 It seems difficult to me now that of chile 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.840
 it's going to be a little quieter I think 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.070
 the differences are going to keep me 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.240
 It seems the goal is to try 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.860
 keep the result 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.080
 Newfoundland has it very close behind to 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.310
 peterhansel who has the great 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.710
 possibility of making a historic podium 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.330
 Well surely it will work for 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.789
 try to take care of it and to close this 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.949
 special emission of ends and there is a 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.599
 topic that we are going to play a lot in having 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:53.639
 sporting morning from 13 to 15 of bolivia 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.229
 supposedly it's going to run there 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.930
 Aboriginal organizations that want 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.900
 cut the race they have three points 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.330
 where the dakar would pass on the bikes and 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.099
 the quads and they are going to cut because 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.770
 they say they harm the environment and 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.720
 also the archaeological zones 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.430
 supposedly already agreed there are 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.729
 an arrangement and they will not cut despite 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.190
 that they will continue to complain and complain 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.440
 some say until they threatened him 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.930
 the aborigines who threatened him and 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.940
 burned the houses if so in the cut is 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.789
 a topic that we're going to talk about a lot tomorrow 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.650
 in tn sports and a subject that I think 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.349
 that Sunday will be with alierta 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.569
 and to a great extent to your after what 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.400
 happened yesterday in Argentina not surely not 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.990
 surely but good in theory the 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.520
 Bolivian agent had asked for his 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.369
 ritual to the pachamama so that they 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.139
 so keep in mind beyond that 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:48.969
 obviously a sporting event like 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.889
 the dakar serves as an excuse for any 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.809
 kind of protest not good if we get to the 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.490
 end of this edition of having extreme 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:57.279
 special of the dakar 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.649
 we are live tomorrow agree on 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.209
 already today from very early we go 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:03.580
 to live the dakar the quality of rest 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:04.899
 in jumps and from 13 to 15 special program 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.240
 to have for diego with many 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:09.240
 protagonists of this 2014 dakar
