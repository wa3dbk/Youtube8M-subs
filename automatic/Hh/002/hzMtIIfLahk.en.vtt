the<00:00:07.350> lots<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.040> calculations<00:00:08.840> let's<00:00:09.840> take<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the lots of calculations let's take a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
the lots of calculations let's take a
stab<00:00:10.349> at<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> annuity<00:00:11.309> calculations

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
stab at the annuity calculations

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.030 
stab at the annuity calculations
remember<00:00:12.929> an<00:00:13.019> annuity<00:00:13.469> we're<00:00:13.650> talking<00:00:13.950> about

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
remember an annuity we're talking about

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.910 
remember an annuity we're talking about
a<00:00:14.160> regular<00:00:14.549> payment<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> same<00:00:16.470> amount

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
a regular payment but in the same amount

much you cash out on my pocket am I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
much you cash out on my pocket am I
going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.700> bank<00:02:36.560> 2,000<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> year

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
going to put in the bank 2,000 a year

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.089 
going to put in the bank 2,000 a year
for<00:02:37.860> eight<00:02:38.250> years<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:39.019> 16,000<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.799> it's<00:02:40.950> going

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
for eight years is 16,000 and it's going

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.470 
for eight years is 16,000 and it's going
to<00:02:41.160> be<00:02:41.250> earning<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:41.790> interest<00:02:42.239> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
to be earning some interest and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.610 
to be earning some interest and
compounding

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
compounding

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.860 
compounding
so<00:02:44.010> 20,000<00:02:44.760> sounds<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.329> have<00:02:45.420> pretty<00:02:45.630> close

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
so 20,000 sounds you have pretty close

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.990 
so 20,000 sounds you have pretty close
to<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> ballpark<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.430> fact<00:02:47.579> that<00:02:47.849> is

to in the ballpark and in fact that is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.030 
to in the ballpark and in fact that is
the<00:02:48.120> correct<00:02:48.420> answer

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
the correct answer

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
the correct answer
okay<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.760> what<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.120> done<00:02:51.299> we<00:02:51.630> said<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
okay so what have we done we said a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.800 
okay so what have we done we said a
regular<00:02:53.099> payment<00:02:53.370> or<00:02:53.730> annuity<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
regular payment or annuity if you like a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.720 
regular payment or annuity if you like a
regular<00:02:55.290> payment<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.829> amount<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.430> rate

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
year which is a half percent so let's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.620 
year which is a half percent so let's

put the data into the calculator and

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.719 
put the data into the calculator and
let's<00:04:34.660> make<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.169> payment<00:04:35.590> be<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.340> negative

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
let's make the payment be the negative

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.649 
let's make the payment be the negative
note<00:04:37.349> step<00:04:38.349> one<00:04:39.300> through<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.510> damn

calculator<00:04:41.320> okay<00:04:41.710> don't<00:04:42.099> you<00:04:42.159> forget<00:04:42.460> that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
calculator okay don't you forget that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.000 
calculator okay don't you forget that
because<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.990> keeps<00:04:44.169> those<00:04:44.289> old<00:04:44.560> numbers<00:04:44.860> in

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
because if it keeps those old numbers in

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.129 
because if it keeps those old numbers in
there<00:04:45.190> your<00:04:46.030> answer<00:04:46.360> won't<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:46.750> anything<00:04:46.960> to

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
there your answer won't have anything to

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.550 
there your answer won't have anything to
do<00:04:47.409> with<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.650> reality<00:04:48.960> all<00:04:49.960> right<00:04:50.139> here<00:04:50.440> we<00:04:50.530> go

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
do with the reality all right here we go

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.670 
do with the reality all right here we go
I<00:04:50.919> got<00:04:51.130> $200<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> month<00:04:52.349> I'm<00:04:53.349> going<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.530> make

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
I got $200 a month I'm going to make

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.350 
I got $200 a month I'm going to make
that<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.889> net<00:04:54.190> make<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.610> negative<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:55.150> put

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
that a net make that a negative and put

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.930 
that a net make that a negative and put
that<00:04:55.510> down<00:04:55.659> for<00:04:55.840> payment<00:04:56.340> my<00:04:57.340> interest<00:04:57.699> rate

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
that down for payment my interest rate

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.529 
that down for payment my interest rate
is<00:04:58.240> going<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.510> be<00:04:58.599> 6<00:04:58.870> divided<00:04:59.260> by<00:04:59.470> 12<00:04:59.830> equals

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
is going to be 6 divided by 12 equals

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.020 
is going to be 6 divided by 12 equals
whatever<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.810> displayed<00:05:02.260> I<00:05:02.289> put<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.970> do

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
whatever is displayed I put in and I do

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.750 
whatever is displayed I put in and I do
that<00:05:04.330> because<00:05:04.419> what<00:05:04.870> if<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.050> had<00:05:05.370> 7<00:05:06.370> divided<00:05:06.729> by

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
that because what if I had 7 divided by

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.670 
that because what if I had 7 divided by
12

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
12

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.810

well<00:05:08.680> I'm<00:05:08.770> gonna<00:05:08.889> have<00:05:08.979> some<00:05:09.220> decimals<00:05:09.669> out

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
well I'm gonna have some decimals out

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.310 
well I'm gonna have some decimals out
there<00:05:10.090> I'll<00:05:10.240> let<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.479> calculator<00:05:10.690> carry

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
there I'll let the calculator carry

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.260 
there I'll let the calculator carry
those<00:05:11.470> forward<00:05:11.830> when<00:05:12.099> I<00:05:12.130> put<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:13.180> the

those forward when I put it in for the

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
screw this up for you and see if you
