 The last time I finally lose now is the time to activate 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 I don't want to use it too much, but I use it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 Awakening 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:35.370
 And the third eye always does not shine 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.550
 But what do you know when you are in awakening skills? 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.240
 Anyway anything is straight 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.320
 Marisa doesn't have a straight. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.780
 I'll see you because it 's an unusual ball, right? 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.460

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.819
 Only in even Shige even he hand brake Taniguchi If the limit 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.650
 I did not choose a pitcher like the previous school because I chose the pitcher 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.799
 If it is the limit, please change 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.489
 Or Naa's game that is still throwing the actor 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.420

 It's not the 4th, it's definitely a hit if you come here anything is straight 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.700
 Can you hold it down first ball straight or lose 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:41.000
 Even if you do not have strength, you can escape with the change ball 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.060
 That's right I don't feel like throwing a changing ball 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.290
 Come here and come back again coming instrumental love 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:54.810
