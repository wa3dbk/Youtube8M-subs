00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.200 
year they're three skelling drills that
I<00:00:27.720> use<00:00:28.050> during<00:00:28.590> my<00:00:29.039> pool<00:00:29.279> sessions<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> help<00:00:30.029> my

be creating a lot more force during your
steering<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:56.939> stroke<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.960> power<00:01:58.259> output

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
steering or stroke and your power output

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
steering or stroke and your power output
would<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.890> will<00:01:59.130> increase<00:01:59.430> significantly

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
would be will increase significantly

would be will increase significantly
zigu<00:02:00.930> arm<00:02:01.079> drills<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.280> we've<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:02.640> single<00:02:03.090> arm

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
zigu arm drills so we've got single arm

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.050 
zigu arm drills so we've got single arm
drills<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.430> three<00:02:05.850> different

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
drills I put these into three different

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.010 
drills I put these into three different
categories<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.259> single<00:02:08.039> arm<00:02:08.270> left<00:02:09.270> single<00:02:09.869> arm

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
categories so single arm left single arm

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.140 
categories so single arm left single arm
right<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> drill<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.550> six<00:02:11.849> full

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
right and then a drill which is six full

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.980 
right and then a drill which is six full
six<00:02:13.050> left

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
six left

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
six left
six<00:02:14.230> right<00:02:14.710> during<00:02:15.370> these<00:02:15.520> drills<00:02:16.000> you've<00:02:16.300> got

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
six right during these drills you've got

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.970 
six right during these drills you've got
to<00:02:16.540> try<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> ensure<00:02:16.990> especially<00:02:17.800> during

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
to try and ensure especially during

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.830 
to try and ensure especially during
single-arm<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.030> you're<00:02:19.120> isolating<00:02:19.750> that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
single-arm that you're isolating that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.960 
single-arm that you're isolating that
arm<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.410> trying<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.770> focus<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.730> may

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
arm and trying to focus on what you may

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.430 
arm and trying to focus on what you may
be<00:02:22.030> doing<00:02:22.450> incorrectly<00:02:23.410> with<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.220> arm
