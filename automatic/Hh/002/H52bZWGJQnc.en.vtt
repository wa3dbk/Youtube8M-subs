00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's plr high tower where you actually

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.910 
it's plr high tower where you actually
just<00:00:31.610> dig<00:00:31.910> around<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.239> entire<00:00:32.450> time<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.930> for

just dig around the entire time and for

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.160 
just dig around the entire time and for
this<00:00:34.010> server<00:00:34.250> i'm<00:00:34.430> pretty<00:00:34.730> sure<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:35.360> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
this server i'm pretty sure that the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.540 
this server i'm pretty sure that the
cards<00:00:36.500> were<00:00:36.590> actually<00:00:36.829> disabled<00:00:37.280> like<00:00:37.399> they

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
cards were actually disabled like they

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.770 
cards were actually disabled like they
were<00:00:37.610> not<00:00:37.760> physically<00:00:38.179> on<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.329> map<00:00:38.449> so<00:00:38.600> if<00:00:38.690> you

just leave it in case I want to play
with<00:03:03.109> friends<00:03:03.319> later<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:03.829> like<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.159> know<00:03:04.220> like

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
with friends later but like I know like

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.039 
with friends later but like I know like
I<00:03:05.000> knew<00:03:05.120> at<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.329> point<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.750> was<00:03:05.870> done<00:03:06.019> with

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
I knew at that point I was done with

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.259 
I knew at that point I was done with
rank<00:03:06.379> because<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:06.890> wasn't<00:03:07.220> even<00:03:07.760> fun<00:03:07.970> arm

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
rank because it just wasn't even fun arm

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.369 
rank because it just wasn't even fun arm
and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:10.060> decided<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.140> know<00:03:12.230> what

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
and then I decided like you know what

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.740 
and then I decided like you know what
tomorrow<00:03:13.120> I'm<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.510> home<00:03:14.599> from

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
school I'm going to sit on my computer

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.880 
school I'm going to sit on my computer
and<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.079> play<00:03:18.319> this<00:03:18.349> freaking<00:03:18.709> game

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
and I'm going to play this freaking game

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.030 
and I'm going to play this freaking game
again<00:03:19.159> and<00:03:19.430> guess<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.090> tomorrow<00:03:21.040> most

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
again and guess what tomorrow most

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.979 
again and guess what tomorrow most
likely<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.970> exact<00:03:23.389> same<00:03:23.599> thing<00:03:23.840> will<00:03:23.959> happen

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
likely the exact same thing will happen

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.020 
likely the exact same thing will happen
where<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> will<00:03:24.829> just<00:03:25.010> had<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> shitty<00:03:25.940> time

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
where I will just had a shitty time

playing this game so in that moment I

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.690 
playing this game so in that moment I
