00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi guys today we'll talk about the cut 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.930
 that one of the most important operations 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.230
 for the maintenance of the lawn 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.540
 green to make a good cut 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.049
 keep in mind the following 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 rules the first rule is the frequency of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 cut in the period of greatest growth 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 for example in spring I recommend you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 cut the lawn at least once a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.820
 week 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.490
 or better yet, twice a week e 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.219
 frequent grass indeed favors 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.130
 the thickening of the grass itself eni 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.010
 subscript the growth of weeds in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 height and should be allowed to grow too much e 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 does ingest to the phase and make the appear 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 lawn after cutting with unsightly 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 yellow streaks 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 true advice is to shave the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390
 lawn with completely dry grass 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 so that there is no presence of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.940
 dew I'm the case we're cutting the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.670
 another tip in the afternoon 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 is to verify the efficiency of the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.040
 mower must be kept in excellent condition 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.780
 conditions the cut must be net e 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.430
 it must not show fraying in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.649
 blades of grass 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.400
 in fact these could then cause 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.410
 illnesses 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.970
 another very important thing is the 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.430
 mower cleaning 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.000
 I recommend you always clean the body 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 the knife and in and do all the debris that 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 they remain of grass 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.790
 another advice is to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.850
 always gather the grass now there are 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.820
 the lawn mower with muccino is sold 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.430
 but I do not recommend them but for those who do not 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.740
 he knew the ching mood is practically 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.740
 a system that allows to pulverize 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.560
 and chop the grass into very small pieces 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.630
 parts the use of these machines is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 advisable in my opinion if you cut the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 lawn frequently only in this case 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.700
 the residue of the cut is minimal and such as to 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.540
 do not damage beauty and health 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 of the lawn
