how is it that something as unconscious

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.099 
how is it that something as unconscious

experience when I see a tree it looks as

experience when I see a tree it looks as
if<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:21.960> seeing<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> tree<00:00:22.590> directly<00:00:23.070> that

if I'm seeing the tree directly that

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
if I'm seeing the tree directly that
science<00:00:24.359> tells<00:00:24.630> me<00:00:24.840> something<00:00:25.230> completely

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
science tells me something completely

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.970 
science tells me something completely
different<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.279> happening<00:00:26.900> light<00:00:27.900> enters<00:00:28.859> the

different is happening light enters the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490 
different is happening light enters the
eye<00:00:29.300> where<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.420> absorbed<00:00:30.900> by<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.019> retina

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
eye where it's absorbed by the retina

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
eye where it's absorbed by the retina
and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> triggers<00:00:32.070> electrical<00:00:32.550> impulses

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and it triggers electrical impulses

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.450 
and it triggers electrical impulses
which<00:00:33.960> travel<00:00:33.989> down<00:00:34.530> lower<00:00:34.770> fibers<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> the

which travel down lower fibers to the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
which travel down lower fibers to the
brain<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.630> brain<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.079> analyzes<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> data

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
brain the brain then analyzes the data

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.569 
brain the brain then analyzes the data
and<00:00:38.550> from<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.480> creates<00:00:40.260> its<00:00:40.620> own<00:00:40.860> picture<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and from that creates its own picture of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
and from that creates its own picture of
the<00:00:41.730> world<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> experience<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the world I then have the experience of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
the world I then have the experience of
seeing<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.270> true

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.050 

what<00:00:50.500> I'm<00:00:50.560> actually<00:00:50.710> seeing<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.370> not<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.880> tree

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
what I'm actually seeing is not the tree

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.360 
what I'm actually seeing is not the tree
itself<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.560> image<00:00:53.890> of<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.070> tree<00:00:54.250> that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
itself but the image of the tree that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.880 
itself but the image of the tree that
appears<00:00:54.700> in<00:00:54.820> my<00:00:54.940> mind<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.740> true

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
appears in my mind and this is true

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.370 
appears in my mind and this is true
everything<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.640> experience<00:00:58.240> every<00:00:59.050> sound

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
everything I experience every sound

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.930 
everything I experience every sound
color<00:01:00.090> sensation<00:01:01.260> taste<00:01:02.260> smell<00:01:02.980> memory

color sensation taste smell memory

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.780 
color sensation taste smell memory
thought<00:01:04.890> they're<00:01:05.890> all<00:01:06.040> just<00:01:06.310> images

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
thought they're all just images

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.840 
thought they're all just images
appearing<00:01:07.150> in<00:01:07.330> my<00:01:07.360> mind<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.670> not<00:01:09.790> just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
appearing in my mind and it's not just

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.570 
appearing in my mind and it's not just
human<00:01:10.420> beings<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.200> I<00:01:11.380> often<00:01:12.310> hear

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
human beings that have it I often hear

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.890 
human beings that have it I often hear
scientists<00:01:13.090> say<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.210> animals<00:01:13.660> aren't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
scientists say that animals aren't

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.370 
scientists say that animals aren't
conscious<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:15.430> really<00:01:15.760> so<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:17.320> I

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
conscious but is that really so when I

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.980 
conscious but is that really so when I
see<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.620> dog<00:01:17.950> lying<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.180> floor<00:01:19.420> asleep<00:01:19.750> and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
see a dog lying on the floor asleep and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.749 
see a dog lying on the floor asleep and
its<00:01:20.140> legs<00:01:20.560> are<00:01:20.770> twitching<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.250> its<00:01:21.369> nose<00:01:21.580> is

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
its legs are twitching and its nose is

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.330 
its legs are twitching and its nose is
quivering<00:01:21.970> I<00:01:22.590> imagine<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.680> streaming<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.280> if

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
quivering I imagine it streaming and if

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.030 
quivering I imagine it streaming and if
it's<00:01:24.460> dreaming<00:01:24.940> is<00:01:25.060> having<00:01:25.390> an<00:01:25.479> experience

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it's dreaming is having an experience

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.830 
it's dreaming is having an experience
and<00:01:27.040> also<00:01:27.220> why<00:01:27.520> else<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:28.060> bothered<00:01:28.420> giving<00:01:28.690> our

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
and also why else we bothered giving our

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.960 
and also why else we bothered giving our
pets<00:01:29.110> anesthetics<00:01:29.770> when<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.009> operate<00:01:30.369> if<00:01:30.820> we

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
pets anesthetics when we operate if we

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.460 
pets anesthetics when we operate if we
didn't<00:01:31.240> believe<00:01:31.420> they<00:01:31.540> were<00:01:31.630> conscious<00:01:32.080> why

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
didn't believe they were conscious why

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
didn't believe they were conscious why
would<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:32.830> want<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.040> make<00:01:33.220> them<00:01:33.369> unconscious

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
would we want to make them unconscious

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.749 
would we want to make them unconscious
the<00:01:35.229> difference<00:01:35.530> with<00:01:35.650> human<00:01:35.950> beings<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.490> that

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
the difference with human beings is that

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.420 
the difference with human beings is that
we<00:01:37.540> know<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.170> know<00:01:38.350> we<00:01:38.950> are<00:01:38.979> conscious

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
we know that we know we are conscious

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.590 
we know that we know we are conscious
that<00:01:39.940> we<00:01:40.360> are<00:01:40.450> conscious<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
that we are conscious with

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.100 
that we are conscious with
self-awareness<00:01:44.220> came<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> sense<00:01:45.610> of<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.850> self<00:01:46.119> of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
self-awareness came a sense of a self of

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.310 
self-awareness came a sense of a self of
an<00:01:47.259> eye<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.740> aware<00:01:48.690> but<00:01:49.690> what<00:01:49.899> exactly<00:01:50.229> is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
an eye that is aware but what exactly is

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890 
an eye that is aware but what exactly is
the<00:01:50.649> self<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.580> feeling<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.659> we<00:01:52.750> all

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
the self this feeling of I that we all

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.620 
the self this feeling of I that we all
know<00:01:53.050> so<00:01:53.290> well<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.970> second<00:01:55.420> great

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
know so well this is the second great

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.820 
know so well this is the second great
mystery<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.200> consciousness

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.250 

to<00:02:03.340> know<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.730> self<00:02:04.000> really<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:05.110> need

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
to know what the self really is we need

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.450 
to know what the self really is we need
to<00:02:05.350> carefully<00:02:05.650> observe<00:02:06.130> our<00:02:06.340> own

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
to carefully observe our own

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.270 
to carefully observe our own
consciousness<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> path<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:08.950> many

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
consciousness this is the path that many

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.550 
consciousness this is the path that many
spiritual<00:02:09.759> seekers<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.270> explore<00:02:10.630> they've
