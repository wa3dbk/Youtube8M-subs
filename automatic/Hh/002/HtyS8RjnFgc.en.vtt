started on this tutorial and I'm using a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.279 
started on this tutorial and I'm using a
size<00:00:52.680> J<00:00:53.100> steel<00:00:53.670> hook<00:00:54.149> okay<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.809> has<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> be

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
size J steel hook okay it has to be

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
size J steel hook okay it has to be
steel<00:00:55.530> steels<00:00:55.860> much<00:00:56.129> better<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
steel steels much better we're going to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
steel steels much better we're going to
use<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> 26<00:00:57.960> gauge<00:00:58.230> wire<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> non

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
use a 26 gauge wire and this is a non

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450 
use a 26 gauge wire and this is a non
tarnish<00:00:59.969> silver<00:01:00.390> wire<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> 28

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
tarnish silver wire and up here is 28

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
tarnish silver wire and up here is 28
gauge<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.149> looking<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.420> thinner

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
gauge so if you're looking for thinner

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
gauge so if you're looking for thinner
wire<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> tendency<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.940> snap<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
wire but it has a tendency to snap you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
wire but it has a tendency to snap you
just<00:01:06.660> got<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> careful<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
else so just like you're going to do a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
else so just like you're going to do a
slip<00:01:27.330> knot<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.990> gonna<00:01:28.080> wrap<00:01:28.440> it

around your finger twice and you will

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.540 
around your finger twice and you will
notice<00:01:30.569> that<00:01:30.899> obviously<00:01:31.470> unlike<00:01:31.920> string<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
notice that obviously unlike string is

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.089 
notice that obviously unlike string is
that<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> memory<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.920> now

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:35.099 
that it has a memory so you can see now

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.760 
that it has a memory so you can see now
it<00:01:35.369> does<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.849> the<00:01:36.420> shape<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.289> what<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.679> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it does have the shape so what I want to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.499 
it does have the shape so what I want to
do<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.459> like<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.789> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.149> do<00:01:39.239> a<00:01:39.270> slip

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
do is just like I'm going to do a slip

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
knot before we're taking the back over

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.680 
knot before we're taking the back over
the<00:01:42.030> forward<00:01:43.369> okay<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> take

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
the forward okay and now we want to take

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.160 
the forward okay and now we want to take
the<00:01:45.840> back<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.709> we<00:01:47.160> just<00:01:47.190> want<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.610> bend<00:01:47.910> it

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
pull the wire that is part of the actual

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.510 
pull the wire that is part of the actual
school<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.289> you're<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.099> that<00:02:02.280> left

over and again you don't want everything

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
over and again you don't want everything
so<00:02:04.890> tight<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.399> can't<00:02:05.489> do<00:02:05.849> anything<00:02:06.300> with

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so tight that you can't do anything with

so tight that you can't do anything with
it

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so what you can see it just goes up and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.180 
so what you can see it just goes up and
down<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> hook<00:02:09.959> without<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.619> problems<00:02:11.039> at

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
back toward my hand so it's out of the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
back toward my hand so it's out of the
way<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.770> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.069> position<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.970> wire

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
would so if this is the way that you

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.720 
would so if this is the way that you
crochet<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.170> would<00:02:22.379> be<00:02:22.530> normal<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.099> if<00:02:23.610> you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
crochet this would be normal and if you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.020 
crochet this would be normal and if you
crochet<00:02:24.270> with<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> pen<00:02:25.349> idea<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.849> that

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
crochet with a pen idea you know that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.910 
crochet with a pen idea you know that
would<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.209> normal<00:02:27.599> as<00:02:27.690> well<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:28.709> want

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
would be normal as well so we just want

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.330 
would be normal as well so we just want
to<00:02:28.950> lean<00:02:29.189> back<00:02:29.569> okay<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.349> pull<00:02:31.680> material

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to lean back okay and just pull material

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.070 
to lean back okay and just pull material
through<00:02:32.579> just<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> chain

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
through just like a chain

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.540 
through just like a chain
so<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.590> lean<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.550> pull<00:02:37.010> lean<00:02:38.010> back<00:02:38.280> and

pull lean back and pull lean back and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.870 
pull lean back and pull lean back and
pull<00:02:45.410> see<00:02:46.410> how<00:02:46.500> simple<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
pull see how simple that is so if you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.330 
pull see how simple that is so if you
have<00:02:48.090> like<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> aluminum<00:02:49.320> hook<00:02:49.740> or<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> plastic

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
have like a aluminum hook or a plastic

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120 
have like a aluminum hook or a plastic
or<00:02:50.820> resin<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.750> wire<00:02:51.990> would<00:02:52.290> catch<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
or resin the wire would catch on to the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.610 
or resin the wire would catch on to the
hub<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.340> because<00:02:53.880> there's<00:02:54.150> metal<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
hub but because there's metal it's a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.710 
hub but because there's metal it's a
steel<00:02:55.860> hook<00:02:56.130> moving<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.060> metallic<00:02:57.360> wire

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
steel hook moving on the metallic wire

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720 
steel hook moving on the metallic wire
you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.710> it's<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.070> sliding<00:02:59.700> through

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you can see it's just sliding through

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.480 
you can see it's just sliding through
like<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:01.050> amazing<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.400> them

like really amazing so you can see them

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.800 
like really amazing so you can see them
being<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.240> loose<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.690> my

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
being a little bit loose with my

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.840 
being a little bit loose with my
stitches<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.710> doesn't<00:03:05.160> really<00:03:05.280> matter<00:03:05.550> and

25 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 and 25 so
that<00:03:36.870> would<00:03:36.990> be<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.230> first<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.740> so<00:03:38.100> what<00:03:38.250> I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that would be the first and so what I

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.949 
that would be the first and so what I
want<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.550> do<00:03:38.700> now<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.880> just<00:03:39.300> using<00:03:39.660> your<00:03:39.750> nail

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
want to do now is just using your nail

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.070 
want to do now is just using your nail
clippers<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:41.520> just<00:03:41.730> want<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.090> always<00:03:42.360> cut<00:03:42.690> over

clippers you just want I always cut over

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320 
clippers you just want I always cut over
here<00:03:43.320> because<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.070> equals<00:03:44.610> almost<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.120> same

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
here because that equals almost the same

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.120
