00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
because I think like there's three play

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.610 
because I think like there's three play
there's<00:04:26.120> three<00:04:26.360> managers<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.080> race<00:04:27.259> right

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
there's three managers in the race right

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.330 
there's three managers in the race right
is<00:04:27.860> between<00:04:28.789> David<00:04:29.660> Moyes<00:04:29.840> Jose<00:04:30.590> Mourinho<00:04:30.860> and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
is between David Moyes Jose Mourinho and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.909 
is between David Moyes Jose Mourinho and
Jurgen<00:04:32.210> Klopp<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:33.259> Dortmund<00:04:34.220> manager<00:04:34.789> so

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
Jurgen Klopp the Dortmund manager so

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.930 
Jurgen Klopp the Dortmund manager so
although<00:04:36.919> Klopp<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.699> really

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
although Klopp is like a really

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.460 
although Klopp is like a really
interesting<00:04:38.360> manager<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.050> he's<00:04:39.139> got<00:04:39.289> a<00:04:39.319> lot

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
interesting manager and he's got a lot

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.409 
interesting manager and he's got a lot
of<00:04:39.530> passion<00:04:39.979> stuff<00:04:40.280> for<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> game<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.849> think<00:04:41.300> he

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
of passion stuff for the game I think he

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.270 
of passion stuff for the game I think he
should<00:04:41.599> stay<00:04:41.630> with<00:04:41.960> Dortmund<00:04:42.380> like<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:42.919> just

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
should stay with Dortmund like I just

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.110 
should stay with Dortmund like I just
think<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.490> should<00:04:43.729> happen<00:04:45.849> but<00:04:46.849> on<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
think that should happen but on the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.210 
think that should happen but on the
other<00:04:47.240> hand<00:04:47.389> Mourinho<00:04:48.139> like<00:04:48.530> he's<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.830> he's<00:04:49.190> a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
other hand Mourinho like he's a he's a

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.640 
other hand Mourinho like he's a he's a
born<00:04:49.580> winner<00:04:49.729> so<00:04:50.360> here<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:50.569> probably<00:04:51.319> will

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
born winner so here we probably will

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.860 
born winner so here we probably will
absolutely<00:04:52.130> dominate<00:04:52.789> and<00:04:52.970> there's<00:04:53.539> more<00:04:53.780> of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
absolutely dominate and there's more of

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.689 
absolutely dominate and there's more of
a<00:04:53.930> chance<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.620> Ronaldo<00:04:55.130> coming<00:04:55.430> back<00:04:55.550> to

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
a chance of like Ronaldo coming back to

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.499 
a chance of like Ronaldo coming back to
man<00:04:55.849> united<00:04:56.000> if<00:04:57.039> Mourinho<00:04:58.039> goes<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.550> two<00:04:59.000> man

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
man united if Mourinho goes to two man

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.469 
man united if Mourinho goes to two man
you<00:04:59.690> so<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.259> that<00:05:00.470> could<00:05:00.740> happen<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.210> just

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
you so that that could happen but I just

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.600 
you so that that could happen but I just
I<00:05:02.599> can't<00:05:02.900> see<00:05:03.199> Mourinho<00:05:03.530> staying<00:05:04.039> for<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> long

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
I can't see Mourinho staying for a long

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.920 
I can't see Mourinho staying for a long
period<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:05.060> time<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.570> see<00:05:06.139> it<00:05:06.259> like<00:05:06.410> he's<00:05:07.039> gonna

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
period of time I see it like he's gonna

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.510 
period of time I see it like he's gonna
join<00:05:08.930> stay<00:05:09.440> for<00:05:09.680> three<00:05:09.919> or<00:05:10.009> four<00:05:10.070> years<00:05:10.310> and

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
join stay for three or four years and

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.520 
join stay for three or four years and
then<00:05:10.610> he's<00:05:10.729> gone<00:05:10.910> whereas<00:05:11.240> more<00:05:11.419> david<00:05:12.320> moyes

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
then he's gone whereas more david moyes

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.490 
then he's gone whereas more david moyes
i<00:05:12.860> think<00:05:13.430> could<00:05:14.150> kind<00:05:14.539> of<00:05:14.659> do<00:05:14.840> like<00:05:14.990> as<00:05:15.169> another

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
i think could kind of do like as another

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.770 
i think could kind of do like as another
Fergie<00:05:16.039> where<00:05:16.190> he<00:05:16.400> he'll<00:05:16.759> stay<00:05:17.030> there<00:05:17.270> for<00:05:17.479> I

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
Fergie where he he'll stay there for I

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.990 
Fergie where he he'll stay there for I
don't<00:05:18.560> know<00:05:18.650> 15<00:05:19.070> years<00:05:19.370> or<00:05:19.490> something<00:05:19.699> not

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
don't know 15 years or something not

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.159 
don't know 15 years or something not
quite<00:05:20.120> as<00:05:20.300> long<00:05:20.419> as<00:05:20.570> per<00:05:20.720> you<00:05:20.870> because<00:05:21.080> I

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
quite as long as per you because I

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.399 
quite as long as per you because I
believe<00:05:21.470> Moyes<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.400> already<00:05:22.960> fairly<00:05:23.960> old<00:05:24.229> I

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
believe Moyes is already fairly old I

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.120 
believe Moyes is already fairly old I
guess<00:05:24.590> I'm<00:05:24.770> sure<00:05:25.009> he's<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.250> his<00:05:25.340> 50s<00:05:26.830> but<00:05:27.830> I

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
guess I'm sure he's in his 50s but I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.460 
guess I'm sure he's in his 50s but I
think<00:05:29.090> Moyes<00:05:29.300> would<00:05:29.509> do<00:05:29.599> the<00:05:29.750> best<00:05:29.960> job<00:05:30.080> and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
think Moyes would do the best job and

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.620 
think Moyes would do the best job and
like<00:05:30.620> people<00:05:31.190> say<00:05:31.490> he<00:05:31.669> may<00:05:31.940> crack<00:05:32.270> under<00:05:32.599> the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
like people say he may crack under the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.420 
like people say he may crack under the
pressure<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:33.110> little<00:05:33.199> bit<00:05:33.440> because<00:05:33.560> he<00:05:33.889> sort<00:05:34.400> of

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
pressure a little bit because he sort of

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.339 
pressure a little bit because he sort of
managing<00:05:34.789> Everton<00:05:35.180> at<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.389> moment<00:05:35.720> who<00:05:35.930> so

he's done a really fantastic job with

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.100 
he's done a really fantastic job with
not<00:05:38.479> a<00:05:38.509> lot<00:05:38.690> of<00:05:38.750> money<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:40.389> but<00:05:41.389> United<00:05:41.930> he's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
not a lot of money and but United he's

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.320 
not a lot of money and but United he's
gonna<00:05:42.259> have<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.560> lot<00:05:42.979> at<00:05:43.310> his<00:05:43.520> disposal<00:05:43.789> and
