00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.589 
land assault weapon
array<00:02:12.819> in<00:02:12.940> there<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> heavy<00:02:16.209> piece

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
array in there it is it is a heavy piece

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.770 
array in there it is it is a heavy piece
of<00:02:17.470> machinery<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> heavy<00:02:18.610> rope<00:02:18.849> robotics

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
of machinery it's a heavy rope robotics

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.559 
of machinery it's a heavy rope robotics
drone<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.800> has<00:02:21.310> heavy<00:02:21.580> caliber<00:02:22.000> weaponry<00:02:22.330> on

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
drone that has heavy caliber weaponry on

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.510 
drone that has heavy caliber weaponry on
it<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.709> got<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> lot<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.160> armor

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
it so it's it's it's got a lot of armor

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.089 
it so it's it's it's got a lot of armor
and<00:02:24.670> there's<00:02:25.060> strategy<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.860> taking<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.950> out

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
and there's strategy to taking it out

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.670 
and there's strategy to taking it out
and<00:02:27.370> actually<00:02:28.000> playing<00:02:28.450> playing<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.650> I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
and actually playing playing it so and I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
and actually playing playing it so and I
think<00:02:29.709> that's<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.069> other<00:02:30.190> thing<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.610> like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
think that's the other thing it's like

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.150 
think that's the other thing it's like
when<00:02:30.850> you're<00:02:30.940> talking<00:02:31.209> about<00:02:32.160> introducing

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
when you're talking about introducing

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.890 
when you're talking about introducing
drones<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.730> advanced<00:02:34.030> robotics<00:02:34.270> into<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
drones and advanced robotics into the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780 
drones and advanced robotics into the
gameplay<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.069> also<00:02:36.220> means<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.670> you're

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
gameplay what that also means if you're

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.460 
gameplay what that also means if you're
a<00:02:36.819> game<00:02:37.000> designer<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.600> all<00:02:37.870> kinds<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.380> new

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
a game designer is all kinds of new

gameplay to both fight against so

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.420 
gameplay to both fight against so
there's<00:02:41.170> new<00:02:41.290> AI<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.680> new<00:02:41.739> strategies<00:02:42.310> to

there's new AI and new strategies to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.160 
there's new AI and new strategies to
take<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> out<00:02:42.819> but<00:02:43.000> also<00:02:43.150> if<00:02:43.599> you<00:02:43.750> want<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.050> in

exactly<00:03:55.870> no<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.010> obviously<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.609> big<00:03:58.060> idea

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
exactly no this is obviously a big idea

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.900 
exactly no this is obviously a big idea
for<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.049> series<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.709> imagine<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.579> was<00:04:00.670> at<00:04:00.819> one

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
for the series I imagine it was at one

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.759 
for the series I imagine it was at one
point<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.239> small<00:04:01.450> idea<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.930> just<00:04:02.079> one<00:04:02.319> person

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
point a small idea that just one person

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.680 
point a small idea that just one person
had<00:04:02.950> can<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.250> pinpoint<00:04:03.489> where<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.180> originated

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
had can you pinpoint where it originated

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.400 
had can you pinpoint where it originated
or<00:04:04.959> who<00:04:05.140> came<00:04:05.350> up<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.709> um<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.810> it's<00:04:08.109> you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
or who came up with it um it is it's you

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.009 
or who came up with it um it is it's you
know<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:09.100> team<00:04:09.280> environment<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.060> there

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
know it's a team environment it is there

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.500 
know it's a team environment it is there
are<00:04:11.200> usually<00:04:11.760> groups<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.910> people<00:04:13.209> who<00:04:13.299> talk

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
are usually groups of people who talk

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.330 
are usually groups of people who talk
about<00:04:13.840> about<00:04:14.260> things<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.040> idea

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
about about things and this is the idea

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.150 
about about things and this is the idea
of<00:04:15.489> creating<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.600> more<00:04:17.109> sandbox<00:04:17.709> gameplay

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
of creating a more sandbox gameplay

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.690 
of creating a more sandbox gameplay
experience<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.419> not<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.320> new<00:04:20.560> idea<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:21.250> and

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
experience is not a new idea and and

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.540 
experience is not a new idea and and
this<00:04:22.090> particular<00:04:22.530> expression<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> has

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
this particular expression of it has

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.670 
this particular expression of it has
actually<00:04:25.120> gone<00:04:25.270> through<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.570> lot<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.960> iteration

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
actually gone through a lot of iteration

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
Anthony our directors very involved in

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.060 
Anthony our directors very involved in
it<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.509> from<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.930> very<00:04:44.080> beginning<00:04:44.470> wanted<00:04:44.919> to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
it and from the very beginning wanted to

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.830 
it and from the very beginning wanted to
try<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.370> introduce<00:04:45.729> this<00:04:46.270> sort<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:48.400> know

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
try to introduce this sort of you know

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.090 
try to introduce this sort of you know
non-standard<00:04:49.840> non-traditional<00:04:50.380> gameplay

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
non-standard non-traditional gameplay

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.550 
non-standard non-traditional gameplay
into<00:04:51.490> into<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.449> campaign<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.110> they've<00:04:53.440> been

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
into into the campaign and they've been

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.870 
into into the campaign and they've been
working<00:04:53.740> on<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.490> what<00:04:54.729> you've

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
working on it and this is what you've

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.909 
working on it and this is what you've
what<00:04:55.210> you're<00:04:55.330> seeing<00:04:55.539> today<00:04:55.600> is<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.380> result<00:04:56.590> of

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
what you're seeing today is a result of

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.520 
what you're seeing today is a result of
a<00:04:57.460> lot<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:57.940> hard<00:04:58.090> work<00:04:58.120> over<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.930> prototyping

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
a lot of hard work over the prototyping

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.379 
a lot of hard work over the prototyping
phase<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:00.099> iteration<00:05:00.580> phase<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.090> this<00:05:01.180> is

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
phase and iteration phase and this is

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.420 
phase and iteration phase and this is
this<00:05:01.660> is<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> result<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.349> that<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.710> this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
this is the result of that so this

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.980 
this is the result of that so this
doesn't<00:05:03.610> even<00:05:03.699> look<00:05:03.849> like<00:05:04.030> where<00:05:04.449> we<00:05:04.599> started

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
doesn't even look like where we started

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.719 
doesn't even look like where we started
but<00:05:05.139> that's<00:05:05.320> not<00:05:05.560> uncommon<00:05:05.949> in<00:05:06.190> development<00:05:06.699> I

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
but that's not uncommon in development I

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.029 
but that's not uncommon in development I
mean<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:06.940> have<00:05:07.060> an<00:05:07.180> idea<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.810> then<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.650> go<00:05:08.979> to

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
mean you have an idea and then you go to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.700 
mean you have an idea and then you go to
prototype<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.669> implement<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.590> sometimes<00:05:11.590> you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
prototype and implement it sometimes you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.680 
prototype and implement it sometimes you
iterate<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.160> iterate<00:05:12.550> iterate<00:05:12.729> on<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.300> now<00:05:13.660> it

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
iterate and iterate iterate on it now it

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.510 
iterate and iterate iterate on it now it
seems<00:05:14.050> like<00:05:14.259> with<00:05:14.500> this<00:05:14.620> franchise<00:05:15.130> sometimes

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
seems like with this franchise sometimes

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.310 
seems like with this franchise sometimes
if<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.849> fans<00:05:16.120> ask<00:05:16.479> for<00:05:16.810> something<00:05:16.990> enough

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
if the fans ask for something enough

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.439 
if the fans ask for something enough
they<00:05:17.650> usually<00:05:17.830> get<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.310> like<00:05:18.550> we<00:05:18.729> had<00:05:18.849> co-op<00:05:19.240> we

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
they usually get it like we had co-op we

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.170 
they usually get it like we had co-op we
had<00:05:19.570> zombies<00:05:20.020> there<00:05:20.620> has<00:05:20.770> been<00:05:21.090> there<00:05:22.090> have

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
had zombies there has been there have

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.550 
had zombies there has been there have
been<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.300> number<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.690> critics<00:05:23.110> who<00:05:23.199> have<00:05:23.259> called

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
been a number of critics who have called

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.189 
been a number of critics who have called
the<00:05:23.680> game<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:24.039> linear<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.610> this<00:05:24.789> kind<00:05:25.060> of

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
the game to linear is this kind of

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.659 
the game to linear is this kind of
welcoming<00:05:26.199> them<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.650> open<00:05:26.860> arms<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.400> saying

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
welcoming them with open arms and saying

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.730 
welcoming them with open arms and saying
here<00:05:27.970> is<00:05:28.000> something<00:05:28.270> finally<00:05:28.840> for<00:05:29.139> people<00:05:29.620> who

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
here is something finally for people who

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.560 
here is something finally for people who
have<00:05:29.979> that<00:05:30.220> criticism<00:05:30.639> we<00:05:30.940> want<00:05:31.150> something<00:05:31.479> a

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
have that criticism we want something a

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.930 
have that criticism we want something a
bit<00:05:31.960> more<00:05:32.020> like<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.590> old-school<00:05:32.919> pc<00:05:33.580> shooter

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
bit more like the old-school pc shooter

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.140 
bit more like the old-school pc shooter
so<00:05:34.150> i<00:05:34.180> think<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.570> absolutely<00:05:34.720> answers<00:05:35.530> answers

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
so i think it absolutely answers answers

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.339 
so i think it absolutely answers answers
people<00:05:37.150> critics<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.720> way<00:05:37.840> but<00:05:37.960> that's<00:05:38.080> not

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
people critics that way but that's not

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.790 
people critics that way but that's not
necessarily<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:39.599> motivation<00:05:40.599> behind<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:41.139> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
necessarily the motivation behind it the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.969 
necessarily the motivation behind it the
desire<00:05:42.159> to<00:05:42.190> create<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.900> nonlinear<00:05:44.590> game<00:05:44.800> mode

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
desire to create the nonlinear game mode

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.189 
desire to create the nonlinear game mode
the<00:05:45.159> sandbox<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:46.659> branching<00:05:46.990> storylines

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
the sandbox the branching storylines

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.950 
the sandbox the branching storylines
those<00:05:47.710> are<00:05:47.800> something<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.039> we<00:05:48.130> wanted<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.580> do

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
those are something that we wanted to do

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.200 
those are something that we wanted to do
but<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.169> does<00:05:50.409> align<00:05:50.919> well<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.970> know<00:05:52.060> like

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
but it does align well you know like

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.399 
but it does align well you know like
we've<00:05:52.599> been<00:05:52.690> making<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.990> lot<00:05:53.020> of<00:05:53.139> these<00:05:53.260> games

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
we've been making a lot of these games

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.750 
we've been making a lot of these games
with<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.680> lot<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.830> veterans<00:05:54.220> who've<00:05:54.370> made<00:05:54.520> these

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
with a lot of veterans who've made these

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.010 
with a lot of veterans who've made these
games<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.300> stepping<00:05:55.539> up<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> new

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
games and so stepping up to a new

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.680 
games and so stepping up to a new
challenge<00:05:56.380> for<00:05:56.409> us<00:05:56.759> dev<00:05:57.759> tales<00:05:58.000> nicely<00:05:58.360> also

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
challenge for us dev tales nicely also

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.310 
challenge for us dev tales nicely also
with<00:05:58.930> with<00:05:59.560> a<00:06:00.280> lot<00:06:00.909> of<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.449> what<00:06:01.780> people<00:06:02.110> want

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
with with a lot of of what people want

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.719 
with with a lot of of what people want
out<00:06:02.470> there<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.860> that's<00:06:02.979> not<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.250> say<00:06:03.400> we<00:06:03.430> don't

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
out there and that's not to say we don't

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.159 
out there and that's not to say we don't
listen<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:04.030> that<00:06:04.060> because<00:06:04.270> we<00:06:04.360> absolutely<00:06:04.690> do

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
listen to that because we absolutely do

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.749 
listen to that because we absolutely do
we<00:06:05.380> do<00:06:05.500> listen<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.979> those<00:06:06.099> things<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.639> I'm

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
we do listen to those things and I'm

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.089 
we do listen to those things and I'm
sure<00:06:06.940> they<00:06:07.060> have<00:06:07.180> some<00:06:07.360> influence<00:06:07.599> over<00:06:08.099> over

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
sure they have some influence over over

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.409 
sure they have some influence over over
people<00:06:09.400> but<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.699> isn't<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.000> primary

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
people but that isn't the primary

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.080 
people but that isn't the primary
motivation<00:06:10.900> why<00:06:11.169> you<00:06:11.229> why<00:06:12.039> you<00:06:12.070> know<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.909> this

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
motivation why you why you know and this

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.520 
motivation why you why you know and this
this<00:06:13.120> is<00:06:13.479> a<00:06:13.509> very<00:06:13.659> specific<00:06:13.930> creative

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
this is a very specific creative

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.320 
this is a very specific creative
expression<00:06:15.039> coming<00:06:15.550> up<00:06:15.669> with<00:06:15.789> no<00:06:15.940> one<00:06:16.060> asked

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
expression coming up with no one asked

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.939 
expression coming up with no one asked
for<00:06:16.389> specifically<00:06:16.960> what<00:06:17.409> we're<00:06:17.530> giving<00:06:17.860> them

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
for specifically what we're giving them
