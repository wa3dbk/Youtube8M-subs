00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
here I look at it and I when I heard the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.929 
here I look at it and I when I heard the
price<00:01:43.530> point<00:01:43.829> i<00:01:44.040> was<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.579> pretty<00:01:44.850> excited

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
price point i was i was pretty excited

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
price point i was i was pretty excited
because<00:01:45.509> i<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.140> move<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.619> lot<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
because i know they can move a lot of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
because i know they can move a lot of
these<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.180> sell<00:01:48.360> software

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
for it I guess what software is
supported<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.649> basically<00:01:53.100> a

games<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.420> 2d<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.200> 3<00:02:01.680> DS<00:02:01.829> ended<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> s

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
games in 2d so that's 3 DS ended the s

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.370 
games in 2d so that's 3 DS ended the s
game

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
game

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.929 
game
so<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> looks<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.189> software<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.729> going

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so it looks like this software is going

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.499 
so it looks like this software is going
to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> same<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.290> wow<00:02:07.530> yeah<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to be the same you know wow yeah so that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
to be the same you know wow yeah so that
that's<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.899> big<00:02:10.410> point<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> clarification

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that's a big point of clarification

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.059 
that's a big point of clarification
right<00:02:11.670> yeah<00:02:12.450> no<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.140> huge<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069

know<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:15.030> first<00:02:15.239> when<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.510> saw<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.080> kind

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
know I at first when I saw it I was kind

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890 
know I at first when I saw it I was kind
of<00:02:16.530> disappointed<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.000> upon<00:02:18.690> looking

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
of disappointed in it but upon looking

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
of disappointed in it but upon looking
at<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.590> thinking<00:02:19.650> about<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.459> price<00:02:20.670> point

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
at it and thinking about the price point

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.820 
at it and thinking about the price point
and<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.630> fact<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.110> still<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.769> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and the fact that it still is going to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.309 
and the fact that it still is going to
be<00:02:22.920> pushing<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.580> lot<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.390> existing<00:02:24.900> 3d

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
be pushing a lot of the existing 3d

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.070 
be pushing a lot of the existing 3d
software<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.930> great

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
software I think that's actually a great

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.800 
software I think that's actually a great
move<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.440> them<00:02:28.709> since<00:02:28.890> 3ds<00:02:29.370> has<00:02:30.330> been<00:02:30.569> doing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
move for them since 3ds has been doing

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.309 
move for them since 3ds has been doing
so<00:02:30.989> much<00:02:31.110> better<00:02:31.170> than<00:02:31.560> wii<00:02:31.739> u<00:02:32.360> yeah<00:02:33.360> i<00:02:33.690> think

so much better than wii u yeah i think

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.350 
so much better than wii u yeah i think
it's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:35.130> an<00:02:35.400> interesting<00:02:35.610> move<00:02:36.150> i

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's a it's a it's an interesting move i

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's a it's a it's an interesting move i
especially<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.860> world<00:02:38.100> where<00:02:38.480> consoles

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
I'm shocked about is how quickly this

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.170 
I'm shocked about is how quickly this
thing<00:03:08.880> was<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:11.070> instead<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:11.670> quickly<00:03:11.940> it'll

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
thing was now instead how quickly it'll

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.569 
thing was now instead how quickly it'll
come<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.570> market<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> that's<00:03:13.859> different<00:03:14.459> than

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
come to market and that's different than

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.520 
come to market and that's different than
this<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.180> year<00:03:15.510> long<00:03:15.780> ramp<00:03:16.140> up<00:03:16.350> or

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
this you know year long ramp up or

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.979 
this you know year long ramp up or
multi-year<00:03:17.070> ramp<00:03:17.370> up<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.730> ps4<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.450> Xbox<00:03:18.810> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
multi-year ramp up of ps4 and Xbox and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.569 
multi-year ramp up of ps4 and Xbox and
obviously<00:03:19.380> it's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> portable<00:03:19.890> system<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
obviously it's a portable system and

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.360 
obviously it's a portable system and
fine<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.420> could<00:03:21.570> say<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.530> pretty

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
fine you could say that but it's pretty

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.009 
fine you could say that but it's pretty
impressive<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.880> Nintendo<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.570> don't<00:03:24.870> think

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
impressive that Nintendo I don't think

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.870 
impressive that Nintendo I don't think
anybody<00:03:25.290> expected<00:03:25.980> Nintendo<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.549> come<00:03:26.730> out

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
have to worry about the screens getting

have to worry about the screens getting
scratched<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.980> know<00:03:59.069> as<00:03:59.250> awesome<00:03:59.700> stead<00:03:59.910> of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
scratched you know as awesome stead of

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.569 
scratched you know as awesome stead of
not<00:04:00.180> sure<00:04:00.359> how<00:04:00.510> large<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.989> screen<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.799> you

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
not sure how large the screen is so you

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.059 
not sure how large the screen is so you
know<00:04:02.700> i<00:04:02.730> would<00:04:02.970> hope<00:04:03.209> it's<00:04:03.420> 3ds<00:04:03.810> XL<00:04:04.170> size<00:04:04.739> but

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
know i would hope it's 3ds XL size but

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.090 
know i would hope it's 3ds XL size but
if<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.340> regular<00:04:06.239> 3d<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.750> sighs<00:04:07.019> it's<00:04:07.980> going

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
if it's regular 3d as sighs it's going

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.180 
if it's regular 3d as sighs it's going
to<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.250> tough<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.850> me<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> go<00:04:09.150> backwards<00:04:09.709> and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
to be tough for me to go backwards and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.520 
to be tough for me to go backwards and
and<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.550> also<00:04:11.730> used<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.360> 3d<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.960> occasion<00:04:13.440> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
and I also used the 3d on occasion I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.170 
and I also used the 3d on occasion I
think<00:04:13.770> for<00:04:13.920> those<00:04:14.010> Nintendo<00:04:14.550> published<00:04:14.940> games

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
think for those Nintendo published games

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.800 
think for those Nintendo published games
which<00:04:15.960> seemed<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.290> always<00:04:17.040> look<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.810> best

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
which seemed to always look the best

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.199 
which seemed to always look the best
they<00:04:19.290> seem<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.739> take<00:04:19.980> advantage<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.640> 3d<00:04:21.000> so

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
they seem to take advantage of the 3d so

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.720 
they seem to take advantage of the 3d so
much<00:04:21.390> better<00:04:22.310> occasionally<00:04:23.310> I'll<00:04:23.430> switch<00:04:23.700> it

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
much better occasionally I'll switch it

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.110 
much better occasionally I'll switch it
on<00:04:23.970> just<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.570> how<00:04:24.690> things<00:04:24.900> look<00:04:25.230> um<00:04:26.120> but

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
on just to see how things look um but

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.870 
on just to see how things look um but
you<00:04:27.330> know<00:04:27.890> they're<00:04:28.890> smart<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> sense<00:04:29.730> that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
you know they're smart in the sense that

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.550 
you know they're smart in the sense that
this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.480> hundred<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:30.930> twenty<00:04:31.200> nine<00:04:31.350> dollar

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
this is a hundred and twenty nine dollar

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220 
this is a hundred and twenty nine dollar
device<00:04:31.920> coming<00:04:32.250> out<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.640> fall<00:04:33.230> it's

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
device coming out in the fall it's

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.410 
device coming out in the fall it's
almost<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.010> stocking<00:04:35.520> stuffer<00:04:35.550> compared

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
almost like a stocking stuffer compared

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.300 
almost like a stocking stuffer compared
to<00:04:36.630> how<00:04:36.930> much<00:04:37.110> everything<00:04:37.530> else<00:04:37.620> costs<00:04:38.160> right

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
to how much everything else costs right

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.020 
to how much everything else costs right
yep<00:04:38.820> yeah<00:04:39.210> exactly<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:40.200> i<00:04:40.440> think<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
yep yeah exactly and i think the the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.090 
yep yeah exactly and i think the the
fact<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.600> they<00:04:42.840> still<00:04:43.140> get<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.470> leverage<00:04:43.890> the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
fact that they still get to leverage the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.540 
fact that they still get to leverage the
same<00:04:44.390> software<00:04:45.390> on<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.810> cheaper<00:04:46.500> device<00:04:46.860> that's

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
same software on a cheaper device that's

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.050 
same software on a cheaper device that's
just<00:04:47.790> gonna<00:04:47.910> ramp<00:04:48.360> up<00:04:48.600> their<00:04:48.870> software<00:04:49.650> sales

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
just gonna ramp up their software sales

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.550 
just gonna ramp up their software sales
it's<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.450> really<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.750> smart<00:04:52.140> move<00:04:52.500> for

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's it's a really a smart move for

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.910 
it's it's a really a smart move for
their<00:04:53.010> 3ds<00:04:53.400> software<00:04:54.120> yeah<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.260> do<00:04:55.410> this<00:04:55.620> and

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
their 3ds software yeah to do this and

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.800 
their 3ds software yeah to do this and
and<00:04:56.340> they're<00:04:56.490> keeping<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.000> d/s<00:04:57.300> software
