much<00:00:36.809> anyone<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> key<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.399> matchup

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
much anyone so the key to this matchup

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
much anyone so the key to this matchup
is<00:00:39.090> using<00:00:39.629> Lyon<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:39.989> passive<00:00:40.530> stacks<00:00:40.770> properly

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
is using Lyon as passive stacks properly

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
is using Lyon as passive stacks properly
like<00:00:41.489> Graves<00:00:41.760> has<00:00:41.940> his<00:00:42.149> Q<00:00:42.510> his<00:00:42.719> W<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.440> his

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
like Graves has his Q his W and his

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.529 
like Graves has his Q his W and his
ultimate<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.489> proc<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.390> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
ultimate which all proc them and so it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.360 
ultimate which all proc them and so it's
really<00:00:45.750> easy<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.620> least<00:00:46.680> three<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
really easy to get at least three out of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
really easy to get at least three out of
four<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.940> those<00:00:48.090> passive<00:00:48.600> stacks<00:00:48.899> that's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
four of those passive stacks that's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
four of those passive stacks that's
gonna<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.980> all-in<00:00:50.370> after<00:00:50.730> level<00:00:51.000> 6<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
gonna be your all-in after level 6 and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
gonna be your all-in after level 6 and
that's<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.230> combo<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.430> deadly

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that's when your combo is really deadly

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
that's when your combo is really deadly
but<00:00:54.059> pre<00:00:54.390> 6<00:00:54.690> you're<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.320> strong<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.949> these

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
but pre 6 you're also strong with these

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
but pre 6 you're also strong with these
kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> burst<00:00:56.699> trades<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.629> Leona<00:00:57.960> starts

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
kind of burst trades so Leona starts

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.020 
kind of burst trades so Leona starts
with<00:00:58.440> 4<00:00:58.770> health<00:00:59.039> potions<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
with 4 health potions right and the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
with 4 health potions right and the
enemy<00:01:00.300> AV<00:01:00.629> carry<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.489> Leona<00:01:02.760> can

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
enemy AV carry only has one so Leona can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.299 
enemy AV carry only has one so Leona can
go<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.329> she<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.750> stun<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> enemy<00:01:04.470> ad<00:01:04.650> Graves

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
go in she can stun the enemy ad Graves

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.880 
go in she can stun the enemy ad Graves
follows<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.299> auto<00:01:06.479> +<00:01:06.960> Q<00:01:07.290> combo<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
follows out with an auto + Q combo and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
follows out with an auto + Q combo and
then<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> both<00:01:08.549> disengage<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.750> there's<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
then you can both disengage so there's a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
then you can both disengage so there's a
really<00:01:10.320> simple<00:01:10.799> trade<00:01:11.100> it'll<00:01:11.430> force<00:01:11.640> him<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
really simple trade it'll force him to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
really simple trade it'll force him to
use<00:01:12.030> his<00:01:12.240> potion<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> Graves<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.409> take

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
use his potion and Graves will take

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
use his potion and Graves will take
hardly<00:01:13.830> any<00:01:14.220> damage<00:01:14.549> only<00:01:15.000> Leona<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
hardly any damage only Leona will and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
hardly any damage only Leona will and
she<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> potions<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> heal<00:01:17.460> back<00:01:17.640> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
she has a lot of potions to heal back up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
she has a lot of potions to heal back up
so<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.540> move<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> his<00:01:19.229> passive<00:01:19.740> support

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so if we move on to his passive support

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
so if we move on to his passive support
into<00:01:20.280> Thresh<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> while<00:01:21.330> Thresh<00:01:21.689> doesn't

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
into Thresh and while Thresh doesn't

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
into Thresh and while Thresh doesn't
really<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.950> passive<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
really have to just be passive right but

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
really have to just be passive right but
he<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.180> his<00:01:24.420> kits<00:01:24.750> either<00:01:25.229> disengage<00:01:25.830> or

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
he can use his kits either disengage or

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
he can use his kits either disengage or
engage<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> important

partly because this kind of hyper carry
state<00:02:52.620> where<00:02:52.800> games<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.100> getting<00:02:53.190> longer<00:02:53.520> but

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
state where games are getting longer but

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
state where games are getting longer but
also<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.450> she's<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> very<00:02:54.930> good<00:02:55.110> tank

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
also because she's a very good tank

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.080 
also because she's a very good tank
killer<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.310> very<00:02:56.520> aggressive<00:02:56.940> support

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
killer it's a very aggressive support

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.910 
killer it's a very aggressive support
we're<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.600> go<00:02:57.780> with<00:02:57.930> Blitzcrank<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> lot

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
we're gonna go with Blitzcrank now a lot

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.770 
we're gonna go with Blitzcrank now a lot
of<00:02:58.950> these<00:02:59.130> are<00:02:59.340> kind<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.730> Leona<00:03:00.390> also

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
of these are kind of like Leona also

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780 
of these are kind of like Leona also
works<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.470> Thresh<00:03:01.920> also<00:03:02.220> works<00:03:02.430> as<00:03:02.580> well<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
works and Thresh also works as well but

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.340 
works and Thresh also works as well but
the<00:03:03.030> reason<00:03:03.330> I'm<00:03:03.450> picking<00:03:03.570> Blitzcrank<00:03:04.230> is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the reason I'm picking Blitzcrank is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.350 
the reason I'm picking Blitzcrank is
because<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.770> his<00:03:04.890> natural<00:03:05.100> damage<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.060> idea

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
because of his natural damage the idea

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.790 
because of his natural damage the idea
or<00:03:06.570> synergy<00:03:06.930> here<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> you're<00:03:07.470> gonna<00:03:07.560> mix

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
or synergy here is it you're gonna mix

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.500 
or synergy here is it you're gonna mix
your<00:03:07.980> fists<00:03:08.340> or<00:03:08.400> okay<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.090> knock-up

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
your fists or okay your knock-up

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.030 
your fists or okay your knock-up
probably<00:03:09.870> shouldn't<00:03:10.050> call<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.230> fist<00:03:10.560> Ashley

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
probably shouldn't call it fist Ashley

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.740 
probably shouldn't call it fist Ashley
you're<00:03:11.520> gonna<00:03:11.640> make<00:03:11.850> some<00:03:12.060> knock<00:03:12.240> up<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.600> your

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
you're gonna make some knock up and your

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.080 
you're gonna make some knock up and your
chompers<00:03:13.110> together<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.100> create<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> cc<00:03:14.790> chain

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
chompers together to create a cc chain

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.370 
chompers together to create a cc chain
which<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.300> gonna<00:03:15.540> hold<00:03:15.810> them<00:03:15.990> in<00:03:16.110> place<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
which is gonna hold them in place and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.990 
which is gonna hold them in place and
alike<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.010> kill<00:03:17.250> them<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.910> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
alike to kill them now this is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.060 
alike to kill them now this is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
especially after level 6 this is really

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.650 
especially after level 6 this is really
dangerous<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:21.000> pretty<00:03:21.330> much<00:03:21.420> always

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
good harass so Blitzcrank is gonna pull

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
good harass so Blitzcrank is gonna pull
someone<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.940> he's<00:03:27.180> gonna<00:03:27.330> knock<00:03:27.750> him<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:28.019> into

the<00:03:28.320> air<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.680> which<00:03:28.830> point<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.250> paste<00:03:29.489> your

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the air at which point you paste your

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.580 
the air at which point you paste your
chompers<00:03:29.910> down<00:03:30.330> onto<00:03:30.780> Blitzcrank<00:03:31.320> they're

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
chompers down onto Blitzcrank they're

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.560 
chompers down onto Blitzcrank they're
gonna<00:03:31.709> charge<00:03:32.100> by<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.400> time<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.820> enemy<00:03:32.940> lands

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
he'll be locked in place again and that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
he'll be locked in place again and that
CT<00:03:35.519> chain<00:03:36.000> should<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.450> long<00:03:36.720> enough<00:03:37.019> for<00:03:37.170> you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
CT chain should be long enough for you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.900 
CT chain should be long enough for you
to<00:03:37.350> actually<00:03:37.709> kill<00:03:37.950> them<00:03:38.160> now<00:03:38.640> when<00:03:38.790> we're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
to actually kill them now when we're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.460 
to actually kill them now when we're
looking<00:03:39.000> at<00:03:39.269> passive<00:03:39.690> supports<00:03:40.110> we're<00:03:40.260> kind

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
looking at passive supports we're kind

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.960 
looking at passive supports we're kind
of<00:03:40.530> covering<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.040> their<00:03:41.250> weaknesses<00:03:41.730> right

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
of covering up their weaknesses right

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.610 
of covering up their weaknesses right
and<00:03:42.120> jinx<00:03:42.360> his<00:03:42.450> biggest<00:03:42.780> weakness<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.410> that

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and jinx his biggest weakness is that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.960 
and jinx his biggest weakness is that
she<00:03:43.739> doesn't<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.070> an<00:03:44.280> escape<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.820> she's

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
she doesn't have an escape and she's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.180 
she doesn't have an escape and she's
very<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.360> mobile<00:03:45.870> until<00:03:46.230> she<00:03:46.380> gets<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.739> reset

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
very a mobile until she gets that reset

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.740 
very a mobile until she gets that reset
so<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.790> teamfights<00:03:48.030> when<00:03:48.420> you're<00:03:48.540> playing

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
so in teamfights when you're playing

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.240 
so in teamfights when you're playing
with<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.050> jinx<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> biggest<00:03:49.980> thing<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.220> have

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
with a jinx the biggest thing you have

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.370 
with a jinx the biggest thing you have
to<00:03:50.519> do<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.940> keep<00:03:51.150> her<00:03:51.330> alive<00:03:51.540> until<00:03:51.600> she<00:03:52.050> gets

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
to do is keep her alive until she gets

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.170 
to do is keep her alive until she gets
that<00:03:52.530> reset<00:03:53.010> because<00:03:53.310> after<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> research

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
that reset because after the research

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.270 
that reset because after the research
she<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.600> kind<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.959> look<00:03:55.110> after<00:03:55.320> herself<00:03:55.620> so

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
she can kind of look after herself so

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.740 
she can kind of look after herself so
January<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.700> probably<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> best<00:03:57.300> person<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
January is probably the best person to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.420 
January is probably the best person to
do<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.170> because<00:03:58.440> she<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.800> help<00:03:58.950> people<00:03:59.310> are

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
do this because she can help people are

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.280 
do this because she can help people are
ways<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.910> slow<00:04:00.360> them<00:04:00.600> she<00:04:00.870> can<00:04:00.989> use<00:04:01.140> their

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
ways you can slow them she can use their

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.320 
ways you can slow them she can use their
cue<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.769> also<00:04:01.950> rush<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> crucible<00:04:03.030> or<00:04:03.209> you

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
cue and you also rush a crucible or you

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.150 
cue and you also rush a crucible or you
tend<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:04.050> Janna<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.680> actually<00:04:04.950> quite

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
tend to on Janna it's actually quite

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.650 
tend to on Janna it's actually quite
viable<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:05.940> gonna<00:04:06.060> keep<00:04:06.300> her<00:04:06.450> alive

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
viable so that's gonna keep her alive

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.990 
viable so that's gonna keep her alive
even<00:04:06.959> more<00:04:07.350> now<00:04:07.890> obviously<00:04:08.280> as<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> passive

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
even more now obviously as a passive

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.400 
even more now obviously as a passive
support<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.570> don't<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:09.959> offer<00:04:10.110> too<00:04:10.380> much

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
support you don't really offer too much

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.080 
support you don't really offer too much
in<00:04:10.709> Lane<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> biggest<00:04:11.580> thing<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.910> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
in Lane but the biggest thing is that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.240 
in Lane but the biggest thing is that
she's<00:04:12.269> an<00:04:12.390> anti<00:04:12.810> camp<00:04:13.110> champion<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.070> what<00:04:14.220> I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
she's an anti camp champion so what I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.890 
she's an anti camp champion so what I
mean<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.150> especially<00:04:15.450> see<00:04:15.750> this

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
mean is that you especially see this

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.870 
mean is that you especially see this
when<00:04:16.049> we<00:04:16.200> come<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> counters<00:04:17.040> but<00:04:17.400> jinx<00:04:17.760> is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
when we come to the counters but jinx is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.940 
when we come to the counters but jinx is
gonna<00:04:18.090> suffer<00:04:18.419> from<00:04:18.810> being<00:04:19.049> camped<00:04:19.590> because

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
gonna suffer from being camped because

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.890 
gonna suffer from being camped because
pretty<00:04:20.340> much<00:04:20.430> every<00:04:20.940> jungler<00:04:21.269> right<00:04:21.479> now<00:04:21.630> has

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
pretty much every jungler right now has

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.020 
pretty much every jungler right now has
crowd<00:04:22.260> control<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.800> she<00:04:22.979> isn't<00:04:23.220> MOBA<00:04:23.700> at<00:04:23.820> all

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
crowd control and she isn't MOBA at all

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.790 
crowd control and she isn't MOBA at all
so<00:04:24.479> when<00:04:24.600> we're<00:04:24.720> looking<00:04:24.750> at<00:04:25.050> counters<00:04:25.560> for

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
so when we're looking at counters for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.350 
so when we're looking at counters for
jinx<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.250> two<00:04:26.460> champions<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.030> spring

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
jinx so two champions that spring

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.420 
jinx so two champions that spring
to<00:04:27.449> mine<00:04:27.629> now<00:04:27.840> Morgana<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.439> Annie<00:04:28.979> and<00:04:29.129> he's

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
to mine now Morgana and Annie and he's

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.010 
to mine now Morgana and Annie and he's
probably<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.759> number<00:04:30.030> one<00:04:30.150> counter<00:04:30.659> so<00:04:30.870> this

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
probably the number one counter so this

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.230 
probably the number one counter so this
just<00:04:31.199> go<00:04:31.349> for<00:04:31.560> mauled<00:04:31.800> first<00:04:32.129> so<00:04:32.639> mugs<00:04:32.849> binding

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
just go for mauled first so mugs binding

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.520 
just go for mauled first so mugs binding
is<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.389> really<00:04:33.659> good<00:04:33.780> way<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.960> locking<00:04:34.199> down

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
is a really good way of locking down

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.290 
is a really good way of locking down
jinx<00:04:34.860> from<00:04:35.009> range<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.669> it's<00:04:35.879> really<00:04:36.150> good

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
jinx from range and it's really good

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.209 
jinx from range and it's really good
poke<00:04:36.539> with<00:04:36.719> your<00:04:36.870> W<00:04:37.259> as<00:04:37.379> well<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.889> can<00:04:38.009> kind

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
poke with your W as well so you can kind

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.649 
poke with your W as well so you can kind
of<00:04:38.280> get<00:04:38.430> lane<00:04:38.610> control<00:04:38.849> from<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.509> not

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
of get lane control from this it's not

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.390 
of get lane control from this it's not
so<00:04:39.840> much<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.020> an<00:04:40.199> all<00:04:40.349> in<00:04:40.590> Annie<00:04:40.979> on<00:04:41.189> the<00:04:41.280> other

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
so much of an all in Annie on the other

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580 
so much of an all in Annie on the other
hand<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.699> a<00:04:41.729> very<00:04:41.849> all-in<00:04:42.750> kind<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.110> aggressive

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
hand is a very all-in kind of aggressive

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.080 
hand is a very all-in kind of aggressive
support<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.189> the<00:04:44.250> reason<00:04:44.550> she<00:04:44.669> countered

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
support and the reason she countered

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.640 
support and the reason she countered
jinx<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:45.509> hard<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:46.050> because<00:04:46.080> she<00:04:46.500> can

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
jinx so hard is because she can

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.589 
jinx so hard is because she can
basically<00:04:46.919> one-shot<00:04:47.849> Hill<00:04:48.060> with<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> very

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
basically one-shot Hill with a very

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.779 
basically one-shot Hill with a very
little<00:04:48.780> help<00:04:49.110> from<00:04:49.259> her<00:04:49.409> ID<00:04:49.590> carry<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.520> reason

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
little help from her ID carry the reason

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.760 
little help from her ID carry the reason
this<00:04:50.879> is<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:51.210> good<00:04:51.509> is<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:51.810> jinx<00:04:52.500> takes

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
this is so good is because jinx takes

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.649 
this is so good is because jinx takes
time<00:04:53.129> to<00:04:53.370> ramp<00:04:53.490> up<00:04:53.699> she<00:04:53.969> takes<00:04:54.180> time<00:04:54.449> for

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
time to ramp up she takes time for

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.330 
time to ramp up she takes time for
attack<00:04:55.020> speed<00:04:55.259> to<00:04:55.379> build<00:04:55.590> up<00:04:55.710> she<00:04:55.889> takes<00:04:56.099> time

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
attack speed to build up she takes time

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.219 
attack speed to build up she takes time
to<00:04:56.520> kill<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.569> is<00:04:57.689> just<00:04:57.810> time<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
to kill you and that is just time you

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.480 
to kill you and that is just time you
don't<00:04:58.469> have<00:04:58.620> when<00:04:58.949> you're<00:04:59.069> playing<00:04:59.219> against

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
don't have when you're playing against

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.950 
don't have when you're playing against
an<00:04:59.639> Annie<00:04:59.849> you're<00:05:00.090> pretty<00:05:00.300> much<00:05:00.419> dead<00:05:00.659> already

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
an Annie you're pretty much dead already

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.959 
an Annie you're pretty much dead already
after<00:05:01.409> her<00:05:01.529> combo<00:05:01.949> with<00:05:02.159> her<00:05:02.279> ultimate<00:05:02.789> and

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
after her combo with her ultimate and

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.610 
after her combo with her ultimate and
you<00:05:03.120> don't<00:05:03.360> have<00:05:03.479> time<00:05:03.719> to<00:05:03.900> get<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.169> reset

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
you don't have time to get that reset

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.920 
you don't have time to get that reset
and<00:05:04.800> escape<00:05:05.099> so<00:05:05.969> that<00:05:06.120> pretty<00:05:06.270> much<00:05:06.360> wraps<00:05:06.719> up

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
and escape so that pretty much wraps up

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.809 
and escape so that pretty much wraps up
this<00:05:07.110> episode<00:05:07.319> and<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:07.979> hope<00:05:08.129> you<00:05:08.250> guys<00:05:08.370> enjoyed

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
this episode and I hope you guys enjoyed

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.760 
this episode and I hope you guys enjoyed
it<00:05:09.000> when<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.389> first<00:05:09.659> thought<00:05:09.840> about<00:05:09.990> doing<00:05:10.379> it<00:05:10.650> I

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
it when I first thought about doing it I

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.439 
it when I first thought about doing it I
wanted<00:05:11.009> to<00:05:11.069> do<00:05:11.250> kind<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.550> three<00:05:11.849> or<00:05:11.969> four<00:05:12.000> IDs

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
wanted to do kind of three or four IDs

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.269 
wanted to do kind of three or four IDs
per<00:05:12.779> video<00:05:12.990> but<00:05:13.560> when<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.710> started<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.159> record

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:14.279 
per video but when I started to record

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.080 
per video but when I started to record
this

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
this

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.730 
this
after<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.509> grazing<00:05:15.930> jinx<00:05:16.229> it<00:05:16.349> was<00:05:16.469> already

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
after just grazing jinx it was already

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.559 
after just grazing jinx it was already
kind<00:05:17.069> of<00:05:17.129> long<00:05:17.310> so<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.610> didn't<00:05:18.000> really<00:05:18.180> want<00:05:18.300> to

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
kind of long so I didn't really want to

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.480 
kind of long so I didn't really want to
cut<00:05:18.779> them<00:05:18.930> down<00:05:19.139> I<00:05:19.199> just<00:05:19.409> left<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:19.979> as<00:05:20.099> a<00:05:20.129> two

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
cut them down I just left it as a two

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.890 
cut them down I just left it as a two
and<00:05:20.789> I'll<00:05:20.909> do<00:05:21.090> more<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.360> these<00:05:21.539> kind<00:05:21.810> of

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
and I'll do more of these kind of

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.290 
and I'll do more of these kind of
shorter<00:05:22.529> five-minute<00:05:23.099> videos<00:05:23.430> as<00:05:23.759> with<00:05:24.180> all

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
shorter five-minute videos as with all
