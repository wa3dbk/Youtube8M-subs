00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
are included so let's first talk about

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
are included so let's first talk about
the<00:00:52.770> case<00:00:53.010> itself<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> rugged<00:00:54.180> style

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the case itself it is a rugged style

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.740 
the case itself it is a rugged style
case<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.199> TPU<00:00:56.120> combined<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.449> feels

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
case it has TPU combined with it feels

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
case it has TPU combined with it feels
like<00:00:58.020> hard<00:00:58.350> polycarbonate<00:00:58.620> along<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> back

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like hard polycarbonate along the back

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
like hard polycarbonate along the back
this<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> good<00:01:01.170> job<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.770> absorbing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this will do a good job of absorbing

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
this will do a good job of absorbing
shock<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> impact<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> pong<00:01:04.260> says<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
shock and impact and pong says that it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
shock and impact and pong says that it
is<00:01:04.949> tested<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> absorb<00:01:06.090> shock<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.750> drops<00:01:07.080> from

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
is tested to absorb shock or drops from

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.730 
is tested to absorb shock or drops from
up<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.799> 6<00:01:08.100> feet<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.119> great<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
up to 6 feet which is great so on the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.580 
up to 6 feet which is great so on the
inside<00:01:11.070> you've<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> matte

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
inside you've got this kind of matte

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.539 
inside you've got this kind of matte
polycarbonate<00:01:13.590> piece<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.070> nothing<00:01:14.400> will

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
polycarbonate piece so nothing will

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.210 
polycarbonate piece so nothing will
happen<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.869> phone<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.830> TPU

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
happen to the back of your phone the TPU

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
happen to the back of your phone the TPU
sides<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> sharp

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
sides here are a little bit on the sharp

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.539 
sides here are a little bit on the sharp
side<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> screen<00:01:20.369> protector

side so if you have the screen protector

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
side so if you have the screen protector
you're<00:01:21.360> gonna<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> careful<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
put your phone in it might bubble it up

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
put your phone in it might bubble it up
so<00:01:24.869> let's<00:01:25.290> place<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> phone<00:01:25.920> inside<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so let's place the phone inside you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
start with the button side first and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
start with the button side first and
then<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> wedge<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
then just kind of wedge it in like I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.850 
then just kind of wedge it in like I

used it for a while and I can't really

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.129 
used it for a while and I can't really

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.199 
say 100% that it is effective I
definitely<00:02:59.739> noticed<00:03:00.159> when<00:03:00.609> putting<00:03:00.969> it<00:03:01.060> on

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
definitely noticed when putting it on

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.539 
definitely noticed when putting it on
that<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.780> would<00:03:02.019> gain<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> bar<00:03:02.769> here<00:03:03.219> and<00:03:03.310> there

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
that I would gain a bar here and there

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.490 
that I would gain a bar here and there
but<00:03:04.090> I'd<00:03:04.239> also<00:03:04.510> noticed<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.079> dropped<00:03:05.349> the

but I'd also noticed that it dropped the
bar<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.219> it<00:03:06.909> certainly<00:03:07.359> did<00:03:07.569> not

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
bar here and there it certainly did not

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.929 
bar here and there it certainly did not
make<00:03:07.870> things<00:03:08.139> any<00:03:08.349> worse<00:03:08.469> when<00:03:09.430> using<00:03:09.639> the

hurt<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.340> if<00:03:33.489> you're<00:03:33.639> someone<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:33.970> believes

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
hurt so if you're someone that believes

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.149 
hurt so if you're someone that believes
that<00:03:34.720> cell<00:03:35.139> phone<00:03:35.319> radiation<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.979> harmful

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
that cell phone radiation is harmful

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.780 
that cell phone radiation is harmful
this<00:03:37.060> case<00:03:37.780> will<00:03:38.229> hopefully<00:03:38.650> block<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.609> and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
this case will hopefully block it and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.059 
this case will hopefully block it and
again<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.479> certainly<00:03:41.079> won't<00:03:41.349> cause<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.949> to

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
again it certainly won't cause it to

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.640 
again it certainly won't cause it to
transmit<00:03:42.400> more<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.150> that's<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:44.049> good<00:03:44.259> thing<00:03:44.500> in

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
transmit more so that's a good thing in

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.979
