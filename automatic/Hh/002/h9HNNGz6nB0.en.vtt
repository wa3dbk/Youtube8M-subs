system<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.440> had<00:00:58.530> seen<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.010> really

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
system we had seen that there was really

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
system we had seen that there was really
a<00:00:59.250> lack<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.730> opportunities<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.690> him<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> find

a lack of opportunities for him to find
gainful<00:01:02.760> employment<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.559> dug<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gainful employment and as we dug a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
gainful employment and as we dug a
little<00:01:05.250> deeper<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.820> realized<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
little deeper we realized this is a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.890 
little deeper we realized this is a
pretty<00:01:07.770> systemic<00:01:08.460> issue<00:01:08.640> across<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.479> autism

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
pretty systemic issue across the autism

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
pretty systemic issue across the autism
spectrum<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> across<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.830> country<00:01:11.189> with

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
about eighty percent unemployment among

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
about eighty percent unemployment among
individuals<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.610> autism<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:16.170> father<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
individuals with autism so my father is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
individuals with autism so my father is
an<00:01:16.650> entrepreneur<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> was

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
an entrepreneur and at that time I was

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
an entrepreneur and at that time I was
just<00:01:18.390> graduating<00:01:18.720> Business<00:01:19.409> School<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.920> we

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just graduating Business School so we

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440 
just graduating Business School so we
decided<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.729> wanted<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> try<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> build

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
decided we wanted to try to build

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
decided we wanted to try to build
something<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.680> could<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.100> only<00:01:23.159> employ<00:01:23.580> my

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
something that could not only employ my

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.410 
something that could not only employ my
brother<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.150> create<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.740> community<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
brother but create a community and a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.200 
brother but create a community and a
real<00:01:28.229> atmosphere<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.729> employ<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> lot

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
real atmosphere that would employ a lot

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
real atmosphere that would employ a lot
of<00:01:30.240> people<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.930> autism<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.650> looked<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
of people with autism so we looked at a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
of people with autism so we looked at a
bunch<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> different<00:01:32.640> businesses<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.750> wanted

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
bunch of different businesses we wanted

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
bunch of different businesses we wanted
to<00:01:34.140> choose<00:01:34.350> something<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.909> big<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to choose something that was big and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
to choose something that was big and
bold<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.409> local<00:01:37.770> community

bold in the in the local community

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
bold in the in the local community
because<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> primary

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
because we see that really the primary

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
because we see that really the primary
reason<00:01:40.650> there's<00:01:41.070> such<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:42.180> Hmong<00:01:42.390> people<00:01:42.540> with

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.190 
reason there's such a Hmong people with
autism<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:45.240> society<00:01:45.780> perceives

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
autism is that our society perceives

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
autism is that our society perceives
autism<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> disability<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.030> requires

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
autism as a disability that requires

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
autism as a disability that requires
sympathy<00:01:49.200> instead<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> potentially<00:01:50.220> really

sympathy instead of a potentially really
valuable<00:01:50.880> diversity<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.229> wanted<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
valuable diversity so we wanted to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.050 
valuable diversity so we wanted to
choose<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> business<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
choose a business that could really

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.520 
choose a business that could really
illustrate<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.840> employing<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:55.409> with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
illustrate that employing people with

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
illustrate that employing people with
autism<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> competitive

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
autism can actually be a competitive

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
autism can actually be a competitive
advantage<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.869> business<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
advantage for business so they can

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.679 
advantage for business so they can
actually<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.159> better<00:01:59.399> than<00:01:59.759> typical

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
actually be better than typical

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
actually be better than typical
employees<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> lot<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> job<00:02:02.070> settings<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
employees and a lot of job settings and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
employees and a lot of job settings and
we<00:02:03.000> thought<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:04.170> able<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
we thought that that would be able to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
we thought that that would be able to
have<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.850> measurable<00:02:05.850> impact<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:07.489> employment

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
have a measurable impact on employment

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.760 
have a measurable impact on employment
among<00:02:08.819> people<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.539> autism<00:02:09.810> even<00:02:10.259> folks<00:02:10.560> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
among people with autism even folks that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.229 
among people with autism even folks that
were<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.039> necessarily<00:02:11.520> employing<00:02:11.819> directly

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
were not necessarily employing directly

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.590 
were not necessarily employing directly
but<00:02:12.420> kind<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.660> changing<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> business

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
but kind of changing the business

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.140 
but kind of changing the business
culture<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.070> carwash<00:02:15.250> ended<00:02:15.700> up<00:02:15.790> being<00:02:16.030> an

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
culture so the carwash ended up being an

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
culture so the carwash ended up being an
excellent<00:02:16.450> opportunity<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.340> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
excellent opportunity because it is a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.340
