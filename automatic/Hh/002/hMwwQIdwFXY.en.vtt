any<00:01:29.920> devices<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.250> know<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.520> walk<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.270> they<00:01:32.450> are

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
any devices you know to walk so they are

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.870 
any devices you know to walk so they are
organizing<00:01:33.170> themselves<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:34.040> move<00:01:34.490> through

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
organizing themselves to move through

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.940 
organizing themselves to move through
space<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.780> functionality<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.830> are

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
space so it's a functionality they are

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.800 
space so it's a functionality they are
looking<00:01:37.250> for<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.610> know<00:01:37.729> how<00:01:38.090> can<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:38.390> move<00:01:38.630> from

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
looking for you know how can I move from

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.020 
looking for you know how can I move from
here<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.229> there<00:01:39.260> with<00:01:39.890> those<00:01:40.010> crouchers<00:01:40.729> or

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
here to there with those crouchers or

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.420 
here to there with those crouchers or
with<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> functionality<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.010> moving

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
with this so the functionality of moving

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.390 
with this so the functionality of moving
from<00:01:43.640> here<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.540> this<00:01:44.780> apparatus

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
from here to there with this apparatus

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.130 
from here to there with this apparatus
becomes<00:01:46.400> beautiful<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.890> Rite<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.130> Spring

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
becomes beautiful in the Rite of Spring

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.770 
becomes beautiful in the Rite of Spring
this<00:01:51.190> position<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.430> dancer<00:01:52.850> who<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.300> in

there black so the dancer is like a wave

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.080 
there black so the dancer is like a wave
of<00:02:02.800> perceptions<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:04.250> becoming<00:02:04.670> like<00:02:04.940> an

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
of perceptions is becoming like an

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.600 
of perceptions is becoming like an
antenna<00:02:05.479> or<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.960> web<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.950> communication

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
antenna or a web of communication

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.570 
antenna or a web of communication
between<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.000> high<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> low<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.920> but

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
between the high and the low and so but

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.000 
between the high and the low and so but
into<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.720> functionality<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.650> becomes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
into this functionality it becomes

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.550 
into this functionality it becomes
beautiful
