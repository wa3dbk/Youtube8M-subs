00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
can get lost in a complexity but when we

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.180 
can get lost in a complexity but when we
go<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.049> we<00:02:41.170> teach<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.829> break<00:02:41.980> things

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
back to the basics and the foundation of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.319 
back to the basics and the foundation of
it<00:02:47.560> all<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.340> then<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.579> come<00:02:48.790> back<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.180> can

how<00:02:55.000> much<00:02:55.299> teaching<00:02:55.930> art<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.730> performing<00:02:57.730> art

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
how much teaching art and performing art

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.250 
how much teaching art and performing art
are<00:02:59.760> interconnected<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.360> most<00:03:01.959> definitely

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
are interconnected I most definitely

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.039 
are interconnected I most definitely
recommend<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.519> any<00:03:03.910> Juliet<00:03:04.420> student<00:03:04.840> should

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
recommend that any Juliet student should

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.020 
recommend that any Juliet student should
take<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.590> whole<00:03:06.010> do<00:03:06.160> these<00:03:06.310> opportunities<00:03:06.760> more

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
take a whole do these opportunities more

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.670 
take a whole do these opportunities more
experience<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.690> get<00:03:07.900> outside<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.470> here

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
experience you can get outside of here

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.220 
experience you can get outside of here
the<00:03:09.190> better<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.760> also<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.150> think<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.690> you'll

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
the better and also I think that you'll

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:22.910 
the better and also I think that you'll
learn<00:03:11.379> something<00:03:11.890> too

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.980
