the glyphs I went with glyph of blooming
because<00:02:12.799> basically<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.760> uh<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:15.349> reduces<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
because basically it uh it reduces the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.150 
because basically it uh it reduces the
time<00:02:17.569> life<00:02:17.930> bloom<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.319> currently<00:02:18.800> activated

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
time life bloom is currently activated

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.570 
time life bloom is currently activated
on<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.430> target<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.120> basically<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.810> reduces

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
on the target so basically it reduces

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.360 
on the target so basically it reduces
I<00:02:21.750> five<00:02:22.750> seconds<00:02:23.290> but<00:02:23.560> that's<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:23.890> PvP

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I five seconds but that's good for PvP

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.830 
I five seconds but that's good for PvP
but<00:02:24.580> then<00:02:24.700> at<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.880> end<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.300> also<00:02:25.570> gives<00:02:25.720> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
but then at the end it also gives a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.680 
but then at the end it also gives a
fifty<00:02:26.170> percent<00:02:26.470> more<00:02:26.890> healing<00:02:27.820> bloom<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
fifty percent more healing bloom to the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.450 
fifty percent more healing bloom to the
end<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> life<00:02:29.440> bloom<00:02:29.710> which<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.040> great<00:02:30.430> for

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
end of the life bloom which is great for

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.610 
end of the life bloom which is great for

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.130 
the damage reduction so it's it's good I
guess<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.940> uh<00:03:19.080> next<00:03:20.080> cliff<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.860> trian<00:03:22.140> if

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
guess so uh next cliff is the trian if

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.600 
guess so uh next cliff is the trian if
you<00:03:23.230> guys<00:03:23.350> remember<00:03:23.590> back<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.040> Wrath<00:03:24.340> you
