and<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.970> turns<00:01:43.390> into<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.750> book<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:45.040> was<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> bit

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
and it turns into a book that was a bit

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.780 
and it turns into a book that was a bit
longer<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.980> book<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.460> now<00:01:48.730> just

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
longer and and the book that now just

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.740 
longer and and the book that now just
means<00:01:49.300> everything<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.290> me<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:51.390> decided<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> use

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
means everything to me I decided to use

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.720 
means everything to me I decided to use
death<00:01:53.080> as<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.440> narrator<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.040> book<00:01:54.250> purely

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
death as the narrator of the book purely

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.910 
death as the narrator of the book purely
because<00:01:55.000> there's<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.020> expression<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:56.650> war

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
because there's that expression that war

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.310 
because there's that expression that war
and<00:01:57.100> death<00:01:57.490> are<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:57.910> best<00:01:58.270> friends<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.290> I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
and death are like best friends so I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.630 
and death are like best friends so I
thought<00:01:59.500> who<00:01:59.770> better<00:01:59.800> to<00:02:00.160> tell<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.580> story

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
thought who better to tell this story

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.210 
thought who better to tell this story
set<00:02:01.300> in<00:02:01.330> Nazi<00:02:01.810> Germany<00:02:01.840> because<00:02:02.740> death<00:02:03.040> was

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
set in Nazi Germany because death was

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850 
set in Nazi Germany because death was
everywhere<00:02:03.370> at<00:02:03.760> that<00:02:03.970> time<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.540> place<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.410> I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
everywhere at that time and place and I

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.120 
everywhere at that time and place and I
thought<00:02:06.070> well<00:02:06.310> what's<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.700> opposite<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.240> this

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
thought well what's the opposite of this

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.529 
thought well what's the opposite of this
all-powerful<00:02:09.130> death<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:10.060> thought<00:02:10.240> are

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
all-powerful death I thought are

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.790 
all-powerful death I thought are
vulnerable

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
vulnerable

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.830 
vulnerable
earth<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.550> if<00:02:12.670> death<00:02:12.970> was<00:02:13.210> afraid<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.690> us

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
earth what if death was afraid of us

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.200 
earth what if death was afraid of us
what<00:02:14.170> if<00:02:14.290> death<00:02:14.560> was<00:02:14.800> haunted<00:02:15.190> by<00:02:15.220> humans<00:02:15.910> and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
what if death was haunted by humans and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.600 
what if death was haunted by humans and
that<00:02:17.050> was<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.500> big<00:02:17.680> question<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.460> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that was the big question that was the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.460 
that was the big question that was the
breakthrough<00:02:18.880> because<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.570> thought<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:20.440> only

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
breakthrough because I thought not only

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.920 
breakthrough because I thought not only
is<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.860> unexpected<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.760> makes<00:02:22.000> sense<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.720> well

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
is it unexpected and makes sense as well

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.310 
is it unexpected and makes sense as well
because<00:02:23.740> death<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.310> hand<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.760> see<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:26.050> of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
because death is on hand to see all of

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.870 
because death is on hand to see all of
the<00:02:26.440> terrible<00:02:26.650> things<00:02:27.010> humans<00:02:27.430> do<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.730> each

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the terrible things humans do to each

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.730 
the terrible things humans do to each
other<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.810> realized<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> book<00:02:29.710> was

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
other and I realized what the book was

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.560 
other and I realized what the book was
about<00:02:29.980> at<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.430> point<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.120> trying<00:02:31.510> to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
about at that point and it was trying to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.940 
about at that point and it was trying to
find<00:02:31.780> beautiful<00:02:32.200> moments<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.040> an<00:02:33.220> ugly<00:02:33.460> time

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
find beautiful moments in an ugly time

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.260 
find beautiful moments in an ugly time
probably<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> most<00:02:36.310> asked<00:02:36.640> question<00:02:37.120> about

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
probably the most asked question about

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.910 
probably the most asked question about
the<00:02:37.420> book<00:02:37.570> when<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.840> comes<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.320> where<00:02:38.680> should

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the book when it comes to where should

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.550 
the book when it comes to where should
this<00:02:39.100> sit<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> bookshelf<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.500> a

this sit on the bookshelf is is this a

friends I thought no one's going to read
this<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.270> thought<00:03:04.600> well<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> might<00:03:04.960> as<00:03:05.170> well<00:03:05.290> do

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
this I thought well I might as well do

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.290 
this I thought well I might as well do
this<00:03:05.560> exactly<00:03:06.160> how<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.430> want<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.760> do<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
this exactly how I want to do it and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.420 
this exactly how I want to do it and
follow<00:03:07.660> my<00:03:07.900> own<00:03:07.930> vision<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> book<00:03:09.160> and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
follow my own vision for the book and

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.540 
follow my own vision for the book and
write<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.300> exactly<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.260> style<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.680> want<00:03:11.920> that's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
write in exactly the style I want that's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.090 
write in exactly the style I want that's
when<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.940> really<00:03:12.970> took<00:03:13.360> off<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.080> think<00:03:14.380> half

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
when it really took off so I think half

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.460 
when it really took off so I think half
of<00:03:15.280> writing<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.730> book<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.930> forgetting

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
of writing a book is just forgetting

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.470 
of writing a book is just forgetting
that<00:03:17.620> there's<00:03:17.739> even<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.070> world<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.970> exists

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
that there's even a world that exists

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.500 
that there's even a world that exists
beyond<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.020> book<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.580> writer<00:03:21.970> i<00:03:22.150> think

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
beyond the book to be a writer i think

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.120 
beyond the book to be a writer i think
has<00:03:22.720> nothing<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:23.320> with<00:03:23.470> being<00:03:23.500> published

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
has nothing to do with being published
