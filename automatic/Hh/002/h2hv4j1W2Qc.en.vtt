and they feel pretty good the hardware
that<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.030> got<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:03.150> modest<00:02:04.979> although<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.369> ordered

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
that I got is modest although I ordered

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.150 
that I got is modest although I ordered
the<00:02:07.240> wrong<00:02:07.390> size<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.410> bolts<00:02:09.009> are<00:02:09.130> a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
the wrong size and the bolts are a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.090 
the wrong size and the bolts are a
little<00:02:09.369> lengthy<00:02:10.350> but<00:02:11.350> that's<00:02:11.650> not<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
little lengthy but that's not really a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.390 
little lengthy but that's not really a
problem<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.540> he<00:02:13.840> kind<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> did<00:02:14.400> sometimes

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
problem they do he kind of did sometimes

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.620 
problem they do he kind of did sometimes
but<00:02:15.930> actually<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> hardware<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
but actually I like the hardware on it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.250 
but actually I like the hardware on it
some<00:02:22.830> pretty<00:02:23.830> much<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.700> deck<00:02:24.910> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
some pretty much it with this deck I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
some pretty much it with this deck I
really<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.530> deck<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.980> has<00:02:27.640> pretty<00:02:27.819> good

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
really like the deck it has pretty good

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.750 
really like the deck it has pretty good
control<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.780> concave<00:02:29.230> one<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:29.560> nice<00:02:29.760> um

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
control the concave one it's nice um

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.229 
control the concave one it's nice um
probably<00:02:31.709> rated<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.739> five<00:02:32.950> out<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.160> five<00:02:33.280> really

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
probably rated a five out of five really

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.210 
probably rated a five out of five really
like<00:02:34.510> Baker<00:02:34.890> probably<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.070> be<00:02:36.130> getting

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
like Baker probably going to be getting

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.090 
like Baker probably going to be getting
another<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.850> soon<00:02:37.380> whatever<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.739> snaps

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
another one soon whatever this one snaps

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.370 
another one soon whatever this one snaps
or<00:02:39.690> actually<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> feeling<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.230> one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
or actually I have a feeling this one

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.809 
or actually I have a feeling this one
won't<00:02:41.590> snap<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.040> has<00:02:42.130> pretty<00:02:42.280> good<00:02:42.459> durability

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
won't snap it has pretty good durability

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.140 
won't snap it has pretty good durability
so<00:02:43.120> far<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:44.310> yeah<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.959> that's<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.140> Baker

grip<00:03:40.989> though<00:03:41.260> was<00:03:41.530> probably<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.890> only

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
grip though was probably the only

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.370 
grip though was probably the only
positive<00:03:42.250> thing<00:03:42.549> on<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:42.970> deck<00:03:43.180> besides<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
positive thing on this deck besides the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.190 
positive thing on this deck besides the
full<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.209> design<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.750> was<00:03:46.959> actually

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
full the design on it was actually

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.979 
full the design on it was actually
pretty<00:03:47.230> nice<00:03:47.560> before<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.510> got<00:03:49.510> scratched<00:03:49.810> up

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
pretty nice before I got scratched up

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.539 
pretty nice before I got scratched up
but<00:03:50.230> I<00:03:50.380> actually<00:03:50.620> started<00:03:50.950> chipping<00:03:51.250> at<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
but I actually started chipping at the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.789 
but I actually started chipping at the
bottom<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.030> deck<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.900> like<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.680> actually

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
bottom of the deck to like it actually

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.360 
bottom of the deck to like it actually
has<00:03:54.130> chips<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.730> little<00:03:55.000> cracks

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.430 

there<00:03:59.090> wasn't<00:03:59.390> any<00:03:59.510> pressure<00:03:59.750> cracks<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.349> it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
there wasn't any pressure cracks but it

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.440 
there wasn't any pressure cracks but it
only<00:04:00.500> lasts<00:04:00.860> me<00:04:01.069> about<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> month<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.819> snap<00:04:02.239> on

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
only lasts me about a month and snap on

only lasts me about a month and snap on
my<00:04:02.540> nose<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.230> simple<00:04:03.560> trick<00:04:03.769> eh<00:04:04.540> actually<00:04:05.540> it

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
my nose on a simple trick eh actually it

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.280 
my nose on a simple trick eh actually it
was<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> fakie<00:04:06.730> frontside<00:04:07.730> 180<00:04:08.299> off<00:04:08.659> of<00:04:08.930> all<00:04:09.230> I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
was a fakie frontside 180 off of all I

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.259 
was a fakie frontside 180 off of all I
got<00:04:09.500> three<00:04:09.530> flips<00:04:09.980> one<00:04:10.159> box<00:04:10.430> for<00:04:10.849> foot<00:04:11.060> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
got three flips one box for foot and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.309 
got three flips one box for foot and
it's<00:04:11.450> really<00:04:11.629> not<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:11.870> tall<00:04:12.730> um<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:14.319> don't
