00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.849
 to no longer see the superstars on Algerian television 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.210

 that the show comes from Lebanon, but it still arrives very well 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.310
 That we are not there, especially because at the moment an Algerian candidate is with us 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.930

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.150
 not that the Algerians really take it seriously, he says 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.470
 when I'm under pressure for the charisma of the superstars, though 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.630
 they only have senses 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.730
 Maybe parents would think differently if they had a daughter 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:11.889

 switching Lebanese stations 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.369
