part there from the closure like it's

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.490 
part there from the closure like it's

make
completely<00:04:02.390> after<00:04:02.660> this<00:04:02.840> but<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.380> basically

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
completely after this but this basically

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.710 
completely after this but this basically
just<00:04:03.890> deepens<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.580> part<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.120> makes<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.510> look<00:04:05.630> a

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
just deepens the part it makes it look a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.970 
just deepens the part it makes it look a
little<00:04:05.810> bit<00:04:05.990> more<00:04:06.110> realistic<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.800> matches

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
little bit more realistic and it matches

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.670 
little bit more realistic and it matches
like<00:04:07.340> it's<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.970> good<00:04:08.180> color<00:04:08.420> for<00:04:08.720> my<00:04:08.930> scalp<00:04:09.200> for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
little bit more holistic and that's

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.180 
little bit more holistic and that's
basically<00:04:23.960> what<00:04:24.140> I'll<00:04:24.230> do<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.470> if<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.680> get<00:04:24.920> some
