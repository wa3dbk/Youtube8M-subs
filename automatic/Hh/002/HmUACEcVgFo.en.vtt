failures Oh learning experiences this
one<00:01:21.409> appears<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.400> one<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.700> them<00:01:22.990> not<00:01:23.990> yet

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
one appears to be one of them not yet

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.490 
one appears to be one of them not yet
I<00:01:24.500> will<00:01:25.100> try<00:01:25.310> again<00:01:25.340> with<00:01:25.790> another<00:01:26.500> pancake

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
I will try again with another pancake

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.370 
I will try again with another pancake
but<00:01:28.150> basically<00:01:29.150> maybe<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.540> didn't<00:01:29.870> wait<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.290> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
but basically maybe I didn't wait for it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.530 
but basically maybe I didn't wait for it
to<00:01:30.620> heat<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.010> pan<00:01:31.220> enough<00:01:31.580> maybe<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.330> heats

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
to heat the pan enough maybe the heats

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.130 
to heat the pan enough maybe the heats
not<00:01:32.659> on<00:01:32.990> high<00:01:33.260> enough<00:01:33.760> but<00:01:34.930> definitely<00:01:35.930> not

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
not on high enough but definitely not

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.200 
not on high enough but definitely not
what<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.409> was<00:01:36.560> expecting<00:01:37.010> or<00:01:37.460> hoping<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:38.060> get

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
what I was expecting or hoping to get

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.110 
what I was expecting or hoping to get
okay<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.290> may<00:01:39.500> not<00:01:39.650> look<00:01:39.830> like<00:01:39.890> progress<00:01:40.520> but<00:01:40.970> I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
okay it may not look like progress but I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.000 
okay it may not look like progress but I
think<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.479> is<00:01:41.630> progress<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:42.380> flipped<00:01:42.710> them<00:01:42.860> over

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
think it is progress I flipped them over

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.520 
think it is progress I flipped them over
texture<00:01:43.909> looks<00:01:44.210> good<00:01:44.479> going<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.200> try<00:01:45.380> again

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
texture looks good going to try again

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.460 
texture looks good going to try again
after<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.220> one<00:01:46.430> step<00:01:46.780> okay<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.020> second<00:01:48.440> one

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
after this one step okay the second one

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.450 
after this one step okay the second one
I<00:01:48.770> put<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.220> back<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.790> me

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
I put it back on me

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.190 
I put it back on me
there's<00:01:52.000> nothing<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> lie

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
there's nothing to lie

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.109 
there's nothing to lie
this<00:01:53.530> looks<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.829> lot<00:01:54.009> better<00:01:54.159> what<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.490> did<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.969> I

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
this looks a lot better what I did is I

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.960 
this looks a lot better what I did is I
didn't<00:01:55.420> use<00:01:55.630> two<00:01:56.140> tablespoons

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
didn't use two tablespoons

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:07.869 
didn't use two tablespoons
I<00:01:58.970> used<00:01:59.480> more

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.960 

I<00:02:08.959> haven't<00:02:09.959> used<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.289> dagger<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.800> all<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.340> do

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
I haven't used this dagger at all so do

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.400 
I haven't used this dagger at all so do
I<00:02:12.030> need<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I need it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770 
I need it
liquor<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.370> bought<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.240> crate<00:02:15.480> for

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
liquor that I bought it's the crate for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.860 
liquor that I bought it's the crate for
the<00:02:15.810> syllabus<00:02:16.290> also<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.520> pan<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.780> I'm

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the syllabus also in this pan so I'm

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
the syllabus also in this pan so I'm
thinking<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.830> should<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.250> had<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> pan

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
thinking that I should have had a pan

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.480 
thinking that I should have had a pan
that<00:02:21.210> was<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> griddle<00:02:22.320> flat<00:02:22.680> like

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
that was just like a griddle flat like

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.720 
that was just like a griddle flat like
that<00:02:23.760> guy

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.820 

instead<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.850> having<00:02:28.120> visit<00:02:28.810> attendants

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.280 

I'll<00:02:35.830> try<00:02:36.099> again<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:36.940> keep

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.839 

the<00:02:42.290> other<00:02:42.470> thing<00:02:42.709> I'm<00:02:42.860> thinking<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.370> maybe<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
the other thing I'm thinking is maybe I

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.119 
the other thing I'm thinking is maybe I
don't<00:02:43.970> need<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.750> spreader<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.769> hand

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
don't need that spreader with this hand

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.100 
don't need that spreader with this hand
because<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.120> just

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
because then I can just

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.620 
because then I can just
move<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.710> batter<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:51.240> think<00:02:51.300> that's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
move the batter down I think that's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.470 
move the batter down I think that's
probably<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.640> make<00:02:53.820> crepes

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
probably what it is so I can make crepes

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.710 
probably what it is so I can make crepes
using<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> pan<00:02:55.820> probably<00:02:56.820> not<00:02:57.060> but

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
using the pan probably not but

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.559 
using the pan probably not but
combination

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.660 

and<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.439> do<00:03:01.500> want<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.860> figure<00:03:02.040> out<00:03:02.159> how<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.430> make

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and I do want to figure out how to make

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.509 
and I do want to figure out how to make
it<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:03.239> quite<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.930> great

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
it not quite so great

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.220 
it not quite so great
okay<00:03:05.519> getting<00:03:05.760> better<00:03:06.060> we've<00:03:06.540> abandoned<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
okay getting better we've abandoned the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.849 
okay getting better we've abandoned the
tool<00:03:07.469> altogether<00:03:08.989> okay<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.500> answer<00:03:10.829> is

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
tool altogether okay so the answer is

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.009 
tool altogether okay so the answer is
yes<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.819> make<00:03:12.150> pretty<00:03:12.540> awesome<00:03:13.140> price<00:03:14.719> no<00:03:15.719> I

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
yes I can make pretty awesome price no I

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.830 
yes I can make pretty awesome price no I
don't<00:03:16.260> need<00:03:16.469> the<00:03:16.530> tool<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.370> even<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.390> one<00:03:18.689> is

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
don't need the tool and even this one is

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.750 
don't need the tool and even this one is
a<00:03:18.870> bit<00:03:19.079> long<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.069> probably<00:03:20.250> should

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
a bit long I think it probably should

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.229 
a bit long I think it probably should
have<00:03:20.790> been<00:03:20.970> shorter<00:03:21.359> for<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.720> pan<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:23.239> but

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
have been shorter for this pan that but

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.740 
have been shorter for this pan that but
I<00:03:24.269> am<00:03:25.140> using<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:27.060> you're<00:03:27.359> going<00:03:27.569> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I am using this and if you're going to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.800 
I am using this and if you're going to
use

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
use

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
use
you<00:03:29.170> probably<00:03:29.470> want<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.160> use<00:03:30.310> exact<00:03:31.000> riddle

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.410 

it<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.590> good<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.390> we<00:03:38.390> are<00:03:38.689> doubling<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.860> oh

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
it is so good and we are doubling up oh

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.000 
it is so good and we are doubling up oh
so<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.720> how<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.900> use<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.349> -<00:03:42.620> it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
so this is how you use this - it

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.649 
so this is how you use this - it
actually<00:03:43.370> turns<00:03:43.549> out<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.849> be<00:03:43.879> a<00:03:43.970> pretty<00:03:44.209> pretty

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
actually turns out to be a pretty pretty

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.140 
actually turns out to be a pretty pretty
handy<00:03:45.079> one<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:46.069> tool<00:03:46.370> even

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
handy one so I like this tool even

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.369 
handy one so I like this tool even
though<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.329> can<00:03:47.540> see<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.989> length<00:03:48.170> just

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
though you can see it's the length just

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.670 
though you can see it's the length just
a<00:03:48.439> little<00:03:48.709> bit<00:03:49.269> unwieldy<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.409> can<00:03:51.590> do

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
a little bit unwieldy but but you can do

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.009 
a little bit unwieldy but but you can do
that<00:03:51.860> which<00:03:52.549> it's<00:03:53.000> looking<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.450> little<00:03:53.540> dark<00:03:53.780> it
