00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.640
 i 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.940
 with the practice of our exercises 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.869
 previous now let's make eyes 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.869
 humans on the leaves we are going to mark 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.930
 the upper part of the eye the outlined 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.470
 and we're going to make sure they're the same 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.230
 size 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.350
 now let's mark the bottom of the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.010
 eye but now uniting it so that 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.789
 let's get a pair of eyes trying that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.460
 are the same size in this case not 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.410
 it is necessary to use white paint when 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 background because our sheet is white 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.130
 let's make the girl's eyes 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.770
 marking the center of the eye with a 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.980
 small line or a point 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 from both sides is the first thing that we should 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.460
 do to know that from there 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.290
 let's slide the brush in 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.699
 circular shape 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.470
 and fill in what 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.430
 to achieve 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 cover 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 how are we doing in this way 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.920
 the paint is expanded to the sides 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.050
 because white surfaces should not 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200
 to be older 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 if you make a small circle and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.050
 they leave a white surface on the sides 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.050
 very large are going to be bulging eyes 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.240
 we have to make both eyes remain 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 as much as you can 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.970
 if you fix the top part of the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.190
 circle that we are doing is more 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 wide that the bottom part 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.950
 of the eye circle let's go expanding 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 until you make it look like each other 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 it does not matter what color they want to put 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.630
 in the previous exercise we use 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.990
 coffee painting 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.150
 we do the exercise again 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.630
 outlining the top of the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 eyes and the bottom part joining them 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.909
 Now we are going to use 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.510
 another eye color so they can see the 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.400
 difference more not because of the color we 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 we will always use the same 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.760
 technique 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.510
 we mark our centers with a line 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.690
 or with a point and from there 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.830
 we slide the brush sideways in 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.890
 circular shape 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.490
 until filling up where we create 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.760
 we enough that it looks adequate 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.080
 the eye 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.420
 the white surfaces we already have 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.850
 therefore what we are expanding 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.940
 now it's only with the paint of the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.940
 center 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.880
 all movements of the center towards 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.880
 outside
