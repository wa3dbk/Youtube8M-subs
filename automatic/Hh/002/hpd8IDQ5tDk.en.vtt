into a 79 from a 77 which surety is now

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889 
into a 79 from a 77 which surety is now
because<00:00:35.790> even<00:00:36.360> though<00:00:36.420> he's<00:00:36.570> been<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.809> with

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because even though he's been out with

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
because even though he's been out with
injury<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> long<00:00:38.309> time<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.760> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
injury for like quite a long time I so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.580 
injury for like quite a long time I so
feel<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.300> he's<00:00:39.390> had<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.260> solid

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
feel that he's had some pretty solid

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950

performances<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.129> Arsenal<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.960> game

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.389 
performances for Arsenal on that game
against<00:00:43.320> Bayern<00:00:43.500> Munich<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.129> where<00:00:44.340> he

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
against Bayern Munich I think where he

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
against Bayern Munich I think where he
just<00:00:44.550> lit<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.360> hitch<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.860> did

just lit up the hitch and just did
really<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> main

Premier<00:02:27.360> League<00:02:27.420> at<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.599> moment<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.190> oh<00:02:29.190> yeah

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
Premier League at the moment and oh yeah

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
he's just been really really solid for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.479 
he's just been really really solid for
Arsenal<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.769> really<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.310> he's

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
Arsenal and I really do think he's

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.620 
Arsenal and I really do think he's
deserve<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.959> upgrade<00:02:35.630> right

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
deserve it of a to upgrade right

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.240 
deserve it of a to upgrade right
so<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> first<00:02:37.110> downgrade<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.800> been<00:02:38.040> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
so the first downgrade we have been is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.000 
so the first downgrade we have been is
in<00:02:38.880> class<00:02:39.090> Bendtner<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.380> put<00:02:40.620> him<00:02:40.709> down<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
in class Bendtner and I put him down to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.920 
in class Bendtner and I put him down to
the<00:02:41.040> sense<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.550> from<00:02:41.700> 75<00:02:42.150> because<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.750> feel

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the sense for from 75 because I feel

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.120 
the sense for from 75 because I feel
that<00:02:42.959> he's<00:02:43.170> out<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.440> trophy<00:02:43.709> season

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that he's out of the trophy season

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.090 
that he's out of the trophy season
Arsenal<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.760> again<00:02:45.480> he's<00:02:46.410> only<00:02:46.709> played<00:02:47.069> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
Arsenal and again he's only played a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 
Arsenal and again he's only played a
handful<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.549> games<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.150> those<00:02:48.269> games<00:02:48.480> he

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
handful of games and in those games he

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.539 
handful of games and in those games he
has<00:02:48.780> only<00:02:48.900> done<00:02:49.080> much<00:02:49.290> useful<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.010> that

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
has only done much useful so that

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.070 
has only done much useful so that
doesn't<00:02:50.819> really<00:02:50.850> warrant<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.870> his

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
doesn't really warrant you know his

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960 
doesn't really warrant you know his
reign<00:02:52.260> staying<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.830> gold<00:02:53.100> because<00:02:53.519> he's

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
reign staying as a gold because he's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940 
reign staying as a gold because he's
nowhere<00:02:54.150> near<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.510> gold<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.019> performance<00:02:55.799> wise

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
nowhere near a gold and performance wise

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.759 
nowhere near a gold and performance wise
and<00:02:56.810> he's<00:02:57.810> been<00:02:57.989> linked<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.380> move<00:02:58.410> away<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and he's been linked with a move away to

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.500 
and he's been linked with a move away to
halt<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.220> think<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.670> even<00:03:00.239> though<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.390> might

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
halt I think and even though it might

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.449 
halt I think and even though it might
not<00:03:00.569> be<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> nozzle<00:03:01.019> play<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.500> long<00:03:01.620> he<00:03:01.980> still

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
not be a nozzle play for long he still

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.640 
not be a nozzle play for long he still

shot<00:03:10.799> down<00:03:11.010> quite<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.519> because<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:11.940> know

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
shot down quite a lot because you know

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.970 
shot down quite a lot because you know
he's<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.390> been<00:03:12.540> misfiring<00:03:12.959> left<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.799> right

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
he's just been misfiring left and right

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.910 
he's just been misfiring left and right
his<00:03:14.849> passing<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.959> gone<00:03:16.200> down<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> only<00:03:16.739> snap

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
his passing this gone down the only snap

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
his passing this gone down the only snap
that<00:03:17.040> hasn't<00:03:17.310> gone<00:03:17.400> down<00:03:17.459> basically<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.299> his

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
that hasn't gone down basically is his

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.849 
that hasn't gone down basically is his
defending<00:03:18.989> because<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.350> know<00:03:19.440> he<00:03:19.680> doesn't

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
defending because you know he doesn't

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.280 
defending because you know he doesn't
only<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> striker<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.290> now

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
only need that for a striker and now

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.479 
only need that for a striker and now
that<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:22.590> about<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.040> probably<00:03:23.190> could

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
that I think about it I probably could

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.670 
that I think about it I probably could
have<00:03:23.519> put<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:23.940> rating<00:03:24.630> down<00:03:24.810> further<00:03:25.079> but<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
have put as rating down further but I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.130 
have put as rating down further but I
thought<00:03:25.890> he'd<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.840> don't<00:03:27.840> know<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
thought he'd be I don't know at the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.289 
thought he'd be I don't know at the
moment<00:03:28.170> at<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> time<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.950> thought<00:03:29.250> 74<00:03:30.120> would<00:03:30.239> be

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
moment at the time I thought 74 would be

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
moment at the time I thought 74 would be
decent<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:30.989> yeah<00:03:31.530> if<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.769> get<00:03:32.040> moved<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
decent so yeah if you just get moved to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.710 
decent so yeah if you just get moved to
hole<00:03:32.549> he<00:03:32.760> might<00:03:32.910> get<00:03:33.060> some<00:03:33.269> more<00:03:33.420> starting

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
hole he might get some more starting

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
hole he might get some more starting
time<00:03:33.930> but<00:03:34.890> Arsenal<00:03:35.640> he's<00:03:35.760> not<00:03:35.880> going<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.030> get

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
time but Arsenal he's not going to get

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.270 
time but Arsenal he's not going to get
many<00:03:36.329> more<00:03:36.480> games<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.709> think<00:03:38.040> he's<00:03:38.130> been

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
many more games and I think he's been

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.800 
many more games and I think he's been

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.229 
scrutiny football so yeah he's been
pretty<00:03:43.590> bad<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:44.040> Arsenal<00:03:44.340> I'm<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.940> deserves

got then is abou diaby because I think

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.340 
got then is abou diaby because I think
that<00:03:50.760> he's<00:03:50.910> been<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.870> know<00:03:51.989> he's<00:03:52.109> just<00:03:52.170> been

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
that he's been you know he's just been

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.870 
that he's been you know he's just been
injured<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.769> whole<00:03:52.920> season<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.310> think<00:03:53.489> javi

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
injured the whole season I think javi

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.300 
injured the whole season I think javi
yeah<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:55.350> few<00:03:55.530> games<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.769> he<00:03:55.889> has<00:03:56.040> played<00:03:56.250> he

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
yeah the few games that he has played he

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.160 
yeah the few games that he has played he
he's<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> good<00:03:57.150> player<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.569> be<00:03:57.660> honest<00:03:57.930> he<00:03:58.019> plays

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
he's a good player to be honest he plays

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.720 
he's a good player to be honest he plays
really<00:03:58.380> well<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.709> us<00:03:58.769> on<00:03:58.980> when<00:03:59.100> he's<00:03:59.190> fit<00:03:59.459> but

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
really well for us on when he's fit but

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.160 
really well for us on when he's fit but
that's<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.389> main<00:04:00.540> question<00:04:00.660> he's<00:04:00.959> never

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that's the main question he's never

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.720 
that's the main question he's never
really<00:04:01.380> fits<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.980> actually<00:04:02.250> play<00:04:02.400> any<00:04:02.549> games

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
really fits to actually play any games

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.300 
really fits to actually play any games
so<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.480> think<00:04:04.200> failing<00:04:04.560> me<00:04:04.620> under<00:04:04.769> 20<00:04:05.040> one's<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
so I think failing me under 20 one's a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.440 
so I think failing me under 20 one's a
few<00:04:05.459> weeks<00:04:05.549> ago<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.120> hasn't<00:04:06.150> really

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
few weeks ago but it hasn't really

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.629 
few weeks ago but it hasn't really
played<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.959> first<00:04:07.170> team<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.590> all<00:04:07.709> since<00:04:08.519> he

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
played in the first team at all since he

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.390 
played in the first team at all since he
joined<00:04:08.819> because<00:04:09.209> his<00:04:09.840> career's<00:04:10.410> been<00:04:10.650> written

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
joined because his career's been written

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.750 
joined because his career's been written
ridden<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.030> injuries

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
ridden with injuries

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.360 
ridden with injuries
and<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.900> yeah<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.140> don't<00:04:14.379> think<00:04:14.650> he<00:04:14.920> really

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
and so yeah I don't think he really

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.699 
and so yeah I don't think he really
deserves<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.849> 77<00:04:16.389> rated<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.930> staff<00:04:17.470> because

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
deserves the 77 rated and staff because

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.960 
deserves the 77 rated and staff because
if<00:04:17.829> he's<00:04:17.949> not<00:04:18.100> playing<00:04:18.280> many<00:04:18.489> games<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.880> he

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
if he's not playing many games and he

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.260 
if he's not playing many games and he
currently<00:04:19.120> justify<00:04:19.989> his<00:04:20.880> card<00:04:21.880> being<00:04:22.090> that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
currently justify his card being that

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.170 
currently justify his card being that
highly<00:04:22.449> rated<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:24.070> justify<00:04:24.669> his<00:04:24.790> ability<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
highly rated so to justify his ability I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.480 
highly rated so to justify his ability I
have<00:04:25.270> captain<00:04:25.780> as<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.930> gold<00:04:26.110> 75<00:04:27.040> but<00:04:27.250> I've<00:04:27.340> given

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
have captain as a gold 75 but I've given

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.270 
have captain as a gold 75 but I've given
him<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.729> minus<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.120> downgrade<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:29.320> think<00:04:30.160> all

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
him a minus to downgrade and I think all

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.890 
him a minus to downgrade and I think all
the<00:04:30.430> stats<00:04:30.669> have<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.180> all<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.419> stats<00:04:31.660> down

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
the stats have I put all the stats down

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.560 
the stats have I put all the stats down
and<00:04:32.289> not<00:04:33.190> by<00:04:33.310> much<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:33.970> enough<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.539> that

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and not by much but just enough so that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.620 
and not by much but just enough so that
you<00:04:34.720> know<00:04:35.400> it's<00:04:36.400> all<00:04:36.550> reflected<00:04:36.970> his<00:04:37.210> ability

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
you know it's all reflected his ability

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.779 
you know it's all reflected his ability
when<00:04:37.750> he<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:37.960> fit<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:38.440> that's<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.310> question<00:04:39.460> him

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
when he is fit but that's a question him

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.719 
when he is fit but that's a question him
being<00:04:40.000> fit<00:04:40.949> right<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.190> last<00:04:42.310> downgrade

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
being fit right so the last downgrade

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.830 
being fit right so the last downgrade
then<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.000> gonna<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.210> messy<00:04:43.389> it<00:04:43.630> was<00:04:43.720> all

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
then it's gonna be messy it was all

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.260 
then it's gonna be messy it was all
because<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.169> put<00:04:44.350> him<00:04:44.440> down<00:04:44.620> from<00:04:44.770> an<00:04:44.919> 87<00:04:45.430> 26<00:04:46.030> I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
because I put him down from an 87 26 I

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.370 
because I put him down from an 87 26 I
know<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:46.810> might<00:04:46.990> be<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.169> bit<00:04:47.289> of<00:04:47.320> a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
know this might be a bit of a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.290 
know this might be a bit of a
controversial<00:04:47.830> one<00:04:48.039> because<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.490> know<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:49.270> I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
controversial one because you know so I

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.640 
controversial one because you know so I
saw<00:04:49.570> enough<00:04:49.750> funds<00:04:49.960> might<00:04:50.169> think<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.470> you

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
saw enough funds might think that you

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.230 
saw enough funds might think that you
know<00:04:50.770> he<00:04:51.280> stole<00:04:51.520> done<00:04:51.669> pretty<00:04:51.880> well<00:04:51.970> in<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
know he stole done pretty well in the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.700 
know he stole done pretty well in the
season<00:04:52.600> but<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.020> only<00:04:53.139> reason<00:04:53.199> I'll<00:04:53.440> put<00:04:53.620> him

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
season but the only reason I'll put him

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.350 
season but the only reason I'll put him
down<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:54.010> because<00:04:54.130> he<00:04:54.850> hasn't<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.180> lived

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
down is because he hasn't really lived

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.750 
down is because he hasn't really lived
up<00:04:55.539> to<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.780> hype<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:57.580> so-called

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
up to the hype and this so-called

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.070 
up to the hype and this so-called
ability<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.419> he<00:04:58.510> had<00:04:58.630> at<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.810> start<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.020> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
ability that he had at the start of the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.350 
ability that he had at the start of the
season<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.620> when<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.370> saw<00:05:00.520> no<00:05:00.580> sign<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.940> 42

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
season and when I saw no sign of a 42

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.879 
season and when I saw no sign of a 42
million<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:01.870> everyone<00:05:02.320> thought<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.740> he'd

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
million like everyone thought that he'd

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.590 
million like everyone thought that he'd
be<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.100> best<00:05:03.280> play<00:05:03.460> marika<00:05:03.789> playmaker<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.510> the

be the best play marika playmaker in the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.360 
be the best play marika playmaker in the
leave<00:05:04.750> but<00:05:05.050> he<00:05:05.289> hasn't<00:05:05.770> really<00:05:05.919> shown<00:05:05.979> that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
leave but he hasn't really shown that

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.279 
leave but he hasn't really shown that
and<00:05:06.639> because<00:05:07.449> other<00:05:07.810> people<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.110> actually

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
and because other people have actually

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.469 
and because other people have actually
you<00:05:08.979> know<00:05:09.100> played<00:05:09.310> better<00:05:09.520> than<00:05:09.610> him<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:09.940> in

you know played better than him and in
the<00:05:10.570> awful<00:05:10.840> squad<00:05:11.050> itself<00:05:11.350> he's<00:05:11.530> got<00:05:11.710> an<00:05:11.919> iron

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
the awful squad itself he's got an iron

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.520 
the awful squad itself he's got an iron
Ramsey<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.300> other<00:05:13.479> people<00:05:13.750> who<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.410> know

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
Ramsey and other people who you know

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.900 
Ramsey and other people who you know
just<00:05:14.770> played<00:05:14.979> just<00:05:15.160> as<00:05:15.340> well<00:05:15.490> as<00:05:15.580> him<00:05:15.729> in<00:05:15.820> my

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
just played just as well as him in my

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.969 
just played just as well as him in my
opinion<00:05:16.150> he<00:05:16.780> sort<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.199> faded<00:05:17.470> out<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
opinion he sort of like faded out the

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.430 
opinion he sort of like faded out the
you<00:05:18.849> know<00:05:18.970> limelight<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.289> main

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
you know limelight so that's the main

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.870 
you know limelight so that's the main
reason<00:05:20.470> why<00:05:20.770> I've<00:05:20.889> put<00:05:21.039> him<00:05:21.130> down<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:21.490> still

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
reason why I've put him down I still

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.279 
reason why I've put him down I still
think<00:05:21.910> he's<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> quality<00:05:22.449> player<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.960> all<00:05:23.020> but

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
think he's a quality player and all but

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.990 
think he's a quality player and all but
you<00:05:23.530> know<00:05:23.650> he<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:24.010> doesn't<00:05:24.250> deserve<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.610> 87

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
you know he just doesn't deserve the 87

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.570 
you know he just doesn't deserve the 87
rating<00:05:25.360> by<00:05:25.599> but<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:26.349> know<00:05:26.500> he<00:05:27.130> had<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.250> start

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
rating by but you know he had it start

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.270 
rating by but you know he had it start
with<00:05:27.639> 14<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.570> yeah<00:05:28.990> I've<00:05:29.470> put<00:05:29.710> his<00:05:29.800> pace<00:05:30.010> up<00:05:30.160> by
