00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello just like the animals the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.969
 plants need to reproduce and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.449
 to ensure their protection against 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.710
 aggressors their immobility does not mean 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.990
 not as far as they are without 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 defense 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 it will also be necessary to develop 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880
 different stratagems for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 reproduce 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.030
 favored by their anatomy and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.620
 dissemination nordegren there are two 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.710
 major causes of stress among 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 plants abiotic factors 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.270
 that is to say, physico-chemicals among 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.790
 which heat against which the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.620
 plans have to struggle for that they have 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.840
 developed a number of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 strategies and in particular the presence of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 hairs under their underside that their 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.830
 captures the ambient humidity and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.200
 to retain it from other bread the stomata 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.300
 during hot weather will close 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.950
 to avoid excessive losses 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.259
 of water a second cause of stress is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.720
 constituted by biotic factors 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.940
 ie living things like 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 this giraffe in the savannah that graze 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.370
 the acacias to defend themselves 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.580
 these have two long and hard 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.200
 thorn of about ten centimeters 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 they also emit a gas ethylene 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 that will spread in the air and be 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.780
 captured by the surrounding acacias 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 these will then make tannins 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 very astringent see poisons from the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.729
 same way all parts of leaf 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.370
 are poisoned with the exception of the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.100
 envelope of its fruit whose color 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.990
 However, red indicates the toxicity of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.600
 the seed we have just seen 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.930
 four modes of response that plants 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.869
 can develop to protect themselves from 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 different aggressions 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.220
 if we want to understand the analogy 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 that exists between the flower is the fruit 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.930
 it is necessary to know the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.959
 internal structure be it a tulip 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.890
 or an apple blossom organization 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.010
 general flows 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300
 remains relatively similar on a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.970
 cross section or a simple 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.430
 top view the internal structure of 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.610
 flowers and schematizes abl with a 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.220
 floral diagram we find of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.760
 the inside out the sepals 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.880
 which form the chalice the petals that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 provides the corolla the stamens that are 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.319
 the male reproductive organs and the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.610
 pistil female reproductive organs 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.120
 we find this organization 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.800
 internal 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.350
 whatever the species of plants to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.630
 flowers considered here we have a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.970
 tulip flower and a fruit the apple if 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.560
 we look at what happened between 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.750
 the flowers and fruits once that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.790
 it has been fertilized we find that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.540
 the petals and sepals are gone 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.810
 they have faded 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.420
 on the other hand, the wall of the ovary was 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.790
 p6 to become edible in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.040
 the occurrence the apple and the eggs 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.420
 otherwise counted have become 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.910
 seeds to ensure fertilization 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.079
 crossed that is to say avoid the car 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.250
 fertilization 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.320
 some plants did not do the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.989
 things half as much as most 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.820
 some animals have separated the 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.579
 male flowers on ten feet hurt and the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.299
 female flowers on female feet 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:43.049
 for example the blond lorti the ground 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.180
 the room and it is however a 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.430
 majority of gate plants and flowers 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.620
 males and females on the same foot 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.959
 is the case for example plants 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.750
 corn we find ourselves the flowers 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.130
 females whose every track it will become 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.450
 a grain of corn and the male flowers that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.590
 is at the top of the plant 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.049
 the majority of the flowers we 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.060
 know are however hermaphrodite 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.970
 bearing both the male organs and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.060
 females on the same plane this is the case 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.870
 cherry blossoms of pear tree 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.320
 apple trees and it's in this last 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.700
 example to avoid self fertilization 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.960
 the male and female parts of the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.569
 flower respectively the stamens and the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.930
 worse they mature 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.729
 shifted in time 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.590
 the two main actors of 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.380
 gamete and seed dispersal 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.960
 are the natural elements and the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.180
 animals when in the spring a lot 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.030
 of us are allergic 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.500
 this is often due to the pollen that 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.229
 is carried by the wind 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.729
 this is the year mogami do not forget 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.190
 however, not that aquatic plants 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.919
 they too need to reproduce 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.990
 and disperse their fruits in the case 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.599
 of poetry dounia oceania typical case 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.470
 of the Mediterranean it is therefore 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.479
 diderot range where animals are good 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.669
 obviously important vectors of 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.889
 dissemination of pollen and in particular 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.590
 insects that contribute massively to 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.599
 a pollination of the flowers 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.909
 in the same way the birds or 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.740
 besides any other animal can 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:24.130
 contribute to this dissemination of 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.069
 pollen in the same way as for the 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.370
 pollen the vectors of dissemination of 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.180
 seeds 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.750
 remain the same it is the wind of 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.070
 insect water birds etc 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:43.110
 then we talk about animals 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.110
 diderot in homo and ornithology
