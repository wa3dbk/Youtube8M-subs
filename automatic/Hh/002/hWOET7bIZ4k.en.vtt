00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.820 
of the burner
oh<00:01:33.360> my<00:01:33.660> plug<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.290> already<00:01:34.470> been<00:01:34.620> into

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
oh my plug you have already been into

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.190 
oh my plug you have already been into
the<00:01:34.920> chamber<00:01:35.370> pretty<00:01:36.030> far<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.600> important<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the chamber pretty far very important to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.980 
the chamber pretty far very important to
get<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.070> stove<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.700> hot<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.150> possible<00:01:39.210> as

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
get the the stove as hot as possible as

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:51.320 
get the the stove as hot as possible as
quickly<00:01:40.050> as<00:01:40.590> possible<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> soup

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
quickly as possible so that the soup

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.540 
quickly as possible so that the soup
people<00:01:51.660> they've<00:01:51.780> had<00:01:51.930> approximately<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:53.160> five

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
people they've had approximately at five

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.609 
people they've had approximately at five
minutes<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.720> think<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.080> probably

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
minutes like so I think it's probably

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:08.389 
minutes like so I think it's probably
time<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.210> expose<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> fire<00:01:57.510> who<00:01:57.720> are<00:01:57.869> alt<00:02:07.399> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
time to expose the fire who are alt so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.750 
time to expose the fire who are alt so
