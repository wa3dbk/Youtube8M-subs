than a regular 18:16 camera in that it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.990 
than a regular 18:16 camera in that it
takes<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:17.410> cartridge<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.399> film<00:01:18.910> so<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.550> film<00:01:21.820> is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
takes a cartridge of film so the film is

takes a cartridge of film so the film is
loaded<00:01:22.270> into<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:23.080> box<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:23.830> it's

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
loaded into a box so that it's

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.190 
loaded into a box so that it's
light-tight<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:25.149> safe<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.930> have<00:01:26.050> to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
light-tight and safe so you have to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.950 
light-tight and safe so you have to
worry<00:01:26.410> about<00:01:26.530> fogging<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.369> film<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.970> just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
worry about fogging the film and just

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.469 
worry about fogging the film and just
like<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> cassette<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:30.040> any<00:01:30.310> other<00:01:30.549> convenience

like a cassette or any other convenience

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.140 
like a cassette or any other convenience
medium<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.409> can<00:01:32.470> just<00:01:32.860> pluck<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.729> film<00:01:33.939> into

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
medium you can just pluck the film into

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.570 
medium you can just pluck the film into
the<00:01:34.299> camera<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.990> you're<00:01:35.110> ready<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.380> shoot<00:01:35.740> so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
the camera and you're ready to shoot so

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.080

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.770 
there's no threading no changing bags no
dark<00:01:41.430> things<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.729> think<00:01:42.909> about<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.390> terms<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
dark things to think about in terms of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.870 
dark things to think about in terms of
the<00:01:43.960> film<00:01:44.200> it's<00:01:44.650> all<00:01:44.979> protected<00:01:45.430> in<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the film it's all protected in the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.840 
the film it's all protected in the
cartridge<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.830> camera<00:01:48.280> mates<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
cartridge so the camera mates with the

cartridges<00:01:49.479> in<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.840> cartridge<00:01:50.259> tells<00:01:50.710> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
cartridges in the cartridge tells the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.149 
cartridges in the cartridge tells the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
camera things like what exposure

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.969 
camera things like what exposure
settings<00:01:54.159> there<00:01:54.369> should<00:01:54.610> be<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.560> super<00:01:56.860> 8

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979

camera<00:01:57.400> itself<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.420> extremely<00:01:59.229> easy<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.500> use

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

that that runs the film you've got to

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.550 
that that runs the film you've got to
pay<00:02:09.820> attention<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.329> a<00:02:10.509> few<00:02:10.750> things<00:02:11.140> like

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
pay attention to a few things like

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.330 
pay attention to a few things like
focusing<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.430> image<00:02:13.049> but<00:02:14.049> for<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.769> most<00:02:15.010> part

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
focusing the image but for the most part

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.940 
focusing the image but for the most part
everything<00:02:16.269> that's<00:02:16.600> photographic<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.680> terms

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
everything that's photographic in terms

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.759 
everything that's photographic in terms
of<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.790> necessity<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> decent<00:02:20.470> picture

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
of a necessity to get a decent picture

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.360 
of a necessity to get a decent picture
is<00:02:20.950> pretty<00:02:21.940> automatic<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.870> super8<00:02:23.320> camera

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
is pretty automatic in a super8 camera

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.699 
is pretty automatic in a super8 camera
so<00:02:24.370> super<00:02:24.970> 8<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.299> medium<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> great<00:02:26.410> place

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
so super 8 as a medium is a great place

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.400 
so super 8 as a medium is a great place

I<00:02:35.630> mean<00:02:36.630> one<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> other<00:02:37.110> great<00:02:37.349> things

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
I mean one of the other great things

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.710 
I mean one of the other great things
about<00:02:37.770> super<00:02:38.340> 8<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.239> some<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
about super 8 is that some of the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290 
about super 8 is that some of the
cameras<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.349> still<00:02:40.730> serviceable<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
cameras are still serviceable and so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.640 
cameras are still serviceable and so
there<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.599> technicians<00:02:42.989> who<00:02:43.260> are<00:02:43.319> still

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
there are technicians who are still

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.440 
there are technicians who are still
working<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.220> these<00:02:44.400> cameras<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.270> for

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
working on these cameras this one for

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.479 
working on these cameras this one for
example<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:47.270> restoration<00:02:48.270> project<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
example is a restoration project on a

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.030 
example is a restoration project on a
classic<00:02:50.489> canon<00:02:51.120> camera<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.349> camera<00:02:52.620> even

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
classic canon camera so this camera even

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.089 
classic canon camera so this camera even
though<00:02:53.190> was<00:02:53.489> invented<00:02:54.239> 30-some<00:02:55.170> years<00:02:55.200> ago<00:02:55.739> is

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
though was invented 30-some years ago is

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.800 
though was invented 30-some years ago is
now<00:02:56.489> being<00:02:57.050> remanufactured<00:02:58.160> for<00:02:59.239> use<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.569> has

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
now being remanufactured for use and has

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
now being remanufactured for use and has
been<00:03:01.050> tuned<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.459> calibrated<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.269> that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
been tuned up and calibrated so that

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.559 
been tuned up and calibrated so that
it's<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.650> new<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:06.239> can<00:03:06.390> still

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
it's like it was new so you can still

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.750 
it's like it was new so you can still
get<00:03:06.690> service<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.290> super<00:03:07.680> 8<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:08.040> well<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
get service on super 8 as well and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.289 
get service on super 8 as well and
that's<00:03:08.970> an<00:03:09.510> important<00:03:09.989> part<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:11.000> working<00:03:12.000> in

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
that's an important part of working in

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.550 
that's an important part of working in
something<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.870> knowing<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.290> there's<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
something and knowing that there's a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.860 
something and knowing that there's a
