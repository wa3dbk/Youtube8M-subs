00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 since it is a tutorial on how to change the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 your galaxy s 3 screen when it breaks 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.170
 with complete success that it is thus half 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.230
 complicated to swap is not so easy 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.230
 tombo demonstrates here how you are with 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.230
 safety 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.150
 my galaxy s2 the white gapz is equal to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 This is how I said it and it already broke 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.769
 display once with 15 days of use 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 each engine is more or less than 15 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.620
 centimeters and broke when you want to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.110
 the display of improvement by per display 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 great truth was pure by display for 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.289
 put the display back that he 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 liquid that has the liquid crystal and then 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.070
 It was already have changed who cost 750 reais 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 to change the play 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.609
 so now in April my cell phone dropped and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.270
 broke only the screen 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:09.720
 so I bought a new screen that is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.640
 more or less this is a screen in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 a new screen to change only the glass 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.939
 only I was a bit afraid of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.110
 I thought I would not be able to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.280
 technique for this, then one day 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.640
 9/9 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 a friend of mine see here the tectron pld or 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.090
 Narwhal or harry potter as you wish 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 he arrived here with his galaxy s 4 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 four she also broke he said that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 to do know how to change 6 yes walk is 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.790
 because I 'm a little afraid 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.899
 so people he persuaded me to change 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.500
 beauty then when you buy a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 Earth 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.110
 It comes with a sticker that stays here. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.600
 side comes the screen and no tool 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.670
 you had a screwdriver another was 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 defending a reed and a palette of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.060
 Avoid this one now I do not understand why 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.110
 comes a business so take off on video 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.360
 to pull is if you take off the glass 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 with glue and pulls and leaves a beauty leave 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.100

 not burn here has a glue here 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.520
 inside right 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.100
 and you will need a dryer to 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.930
 paquetÃ¡ passes here at the ends 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.050
 stay pass by spending a lot of time 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.630
 long after school you go 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.810
 turn the screwdriver off this screen 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.600
 then the glue is not 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.910
 for that here and paste your new screen and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.800
 It's with new cell phone. 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.450
 happy my life then my friend then 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 then its roof did not begin to make 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.300
 exchange 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.680
 when he started to do the function that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.010
 I remembered his car having a factor 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.580
 dismantle dismantle dismantle and always 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.190
 piece remains and there is always a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.040
 panel and every time I saw his car 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.560
 I was with more holes and even a little 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.080
 of fear, I confess to you I said 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.500
 here is different and you should know how to trade 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.170
 so he started the process of exchange 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.390
 So he started to take the glass out of my 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.019
 I even left it there for you. 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.610
 see is also stuck here on a tape 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.880
 Is the glass shards coming? 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.920
 very close seeing the glass did not go whole 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.310
 ultimately the cell was 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.270
 so you can see that it was very beautiful 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.170
 functional 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.770
 You see here is the display here is the totti 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:04:08.290

00:03:48.770 --> 00:04:10.790

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.950

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.160

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:26.470
 Another thing they say is to stay. 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.470

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.310

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 There, to play on the cell phone. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.610
 and I was barefoot as it was very 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.940
 piece of glass on the table and it was very 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.920
 with the handling of the dryer when 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.320
 He was going to turn on the glass. 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.280
 when I went to pick up what happens 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.460
 I was the foot one of the broken glass of my 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.110
