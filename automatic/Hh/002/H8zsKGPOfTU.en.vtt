00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 they do not come with you today I'm here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.030
 do the zombie apocalypse tag I found 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.800
 funny and I saw some signs 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 hopeful that I really like the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 I found the company very cool and I 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.900
 I do not know why it is not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.699
 then from that part of the principle that 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 if there was an end to the world with glasses 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.680
 a more living dead bishop is with the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.019
 characters I would like to have with me 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 when it happened 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.769
 so the first character would be a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.769
 character to lead the group 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.260
 in fact in their rings and in the hobbit 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 When it does, it's always that relief. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.219
 much better and knows things when 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.190
 Do not know he has a good solution to 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.410
 solve here and everything else so he is the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.329
 Dude should have giving you my group 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.379
 the second character would be a character 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 with medical knowledge and that's me 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.739
 I chose a character who mostly 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 of people do not know but the beat of the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 bone is all this I'm going to put my teeth 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 here from the books down here 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 Imagine you're a book that I used to go to a lot. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.490
 at ease on the scene I have him 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 I do not think it's about what is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.920
 name of the book is this but it became one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.049
 girl who is she learns to be 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.460
 nurse to the doctor in the middle age she 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.009
 I like it very cool and white so I do not 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 I reminded her because she is obliged to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.939
 make people with no recourse she 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.240
 makes with a piece of wood on the floor she 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.990
 makes bandages and pastes with plants 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 any kind you do not know what 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 you will find medicines or devices that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.299
 You need everything more then in one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.950
 we see that it returns to the middle age 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.780
 because he does not have a personality but 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.240
 still features the character character 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.219
 smart and I chose what he 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.880
 the actress's own brother who was not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:08.340
 due 3 which is our divergence and he 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.590
 edition is given 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.349
 so he 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.510
 and he knows a lot you see in the book that 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.930
 he has knowledge of the truth he 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.550
 to be half two guys a little like this 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 thousand / year child does the right thing but until 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.040
 now so I would like to have it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.019
 here at night the fourth character to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 die first i will kill when charlie 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.450
 of the advantage to be visible 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.879
 I think the shawl and you know that I 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.340
 I did not like that book, you know that. 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:45.930
 I did not like Charlie very much so the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.980
 first zombie movie because it is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.500
 weak 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.930
 He's the one thing about his fight . 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.769
 but in general it is fragile 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.530
 and he is insecure and nano so he would be 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.980
 blood food very very fast 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:08.000
 the character deserves the important 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.629
 and it would obviously be the top hits hawking go 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.060
 toddy it's even younger it starts 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.889
 at 13 12 years old there and then book ends 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.350
 a little more than this he is more 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.880
 new but he 's very fucking 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.470
 he is he is brave and he was very 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.880
 strong like this 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.700
 psychologically and in many people do the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.980
 that has to be done without fear of 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.389
 claim without getting just that 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.690
 questioning the issue of others there 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.620
 it is very much to decide then each type 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.900
 why not 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.190
 theoretical knowledge 6 is a character 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.660
 two face 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.639
 This is a little hard to think is not 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.430
 only one character left 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.010
 really two are remembered none 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.910
 member of the organ of the blood bars 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 hot and it makes sense that it has two faces 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.380
 because he's actually gay but at the same time 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.180
 time ram 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.540
 so I know you are my team too 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.410
 because he is a nice person is a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.480
 very cool forward 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.289
 he does the right thing and has a foot in the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.160
 floor and has this side of it that 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:19.260
 depending on when he would be 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.090
 there with the team people he could be 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.530
 a bit of a video you take care of it 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.000
 could serve as diplomats 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.560
 between agents a bis that are wanting 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.260
 eat all the plays I enjoyed 7 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.080
 character be a funny character 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.020
 I chose George Weasley because now 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.330
 already only 50% of a potential 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.300
 but I still really like the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.500
 Weasley twins were wonderful and having 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.470
 half of them is better than not having 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.840
 none so obvious that you are to see 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.480
 with me and they are also the ones today 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.760
 very capable they played well Quidditch 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.280
 they were fine they were very 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.380
 Only Jorge is a 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.320
 good character you have a team against 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.930
 zombie apocalypse also finds the octave 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.230
 character would be the metric character 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.750
 fearful the team followed the advice and for 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.190
 that no one wanting him to be afraid 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.419
 but at the end of the test its value 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.150
 I really like him, I have a fondness. 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.090
 very special for the bilbo finding my 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.490
 see what the people want to know then 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.610
 I would love to finish the new group 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.380
 character be the child character 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.240
 choose the course of what jackson 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.310
 really it would be complementary should 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.610
 be the character child and the first 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.040
 book conversation again so he 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.210
 falls into this category and it is a 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.850
 interesting character you have a team 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.110
 with so much precision and because he has 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.010
 this thing of being the son of a demigod 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.830
 Olympic Olimpio the Olympus of Olympus 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.610
 so it's cool because the opposition can even 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.789
 be a child but he is very brave 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:58.740
 he turns the situations and he has this 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.740
 power to be poseidon's son then 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.390
 of this character and last character 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.560
 would be used on any and I solved 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:11.140
 choose vÃ­tor fourth team of the village dp 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.390
 because with cool it would take a shot time 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:18.220
 against what he needs to know what 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.810
 fact was gigantic and fierce and lethal 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.590
 It's very cool, I really like this 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.150
 character 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.330
 so I would like an answer in the 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.090
 my team and he would close this team me 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.250
 I found good china real time make the 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.630
 funny delivery had fun 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.860
 choose the characters too 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.950
 did not have much quality for each 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.850
 some category was very difficult to find and 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:43.860
 von can see if we can find 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.860
 liked and kissed and until the next time
