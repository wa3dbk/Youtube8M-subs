loaded<00:02:26.489> up<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.880> should<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.420> things<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> little

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
loaded up we should know things a little

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.390 
loaded up we should know things a little
bit<00:02:28.080> closer<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.530> viewer<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.190> see

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
bit closer in the viewer so you can see

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.030 
bit closer in the viewer so you can see
the<00:02:29.519> inputs<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.150> has<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:31.530> exactly<00:02:31.890> what

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the inputs that it has it's exactly what

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.970 
the inputs that it has it's exactly what
they<00:02:32.130> do

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
they do

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.050 
they do
now<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.160> actually<00:02:35.250> load<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
now when you actually load up the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.150 
now when you actually load up the
Chronos<00:02:36.510> load<00:02:36.780> you'll<00:02:37.049> see<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.440> has<00:02:37.620> five

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
Chronos load you'll see it has five

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.820 
Chronos load you'll see it has five
actual<00:02:38.700> inputs<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.170> first<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.739> we

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
actual inputs the first of all that we

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.460 
actual inputs the first of all that we
have<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.610> source<00:02:42.299> input<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.380> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have is the source input now you have to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.900 
have is the source input now you have to
make<00:02:43.590> sure<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.950> connected<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.610> image

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
make sure this is connected to the image

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.170 
make sure this is connected to the image
sequence<00:02:45.090> which<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.600> every<00:02:45.720> time<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:48.030> also

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
sequence which to every time we also

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.410 
sequence which to every time we also
have<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.810> matte<00:02:49.500> input<00:02:49.739> now<00:02:50.640> we<00:02:50.700> use<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
have the matte input now we use this to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.030 
have the matte input now we use this to
separate<00:02:51.870> chilli<00:02:52.110> for<00:02:52.290> another<00:02:52.590> background

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
separate chilli for another background

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
separate chilli for another background
now<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.819> can<00:02:54.000> improve<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.600> emotion

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
now this can improve the emotion

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.440 
now this can improve the emotion
estimation<00:02:55.769> by<00:02:56.010> reducing<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.760> dragging<00:02:57.329> of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
estimation by reducing the dragging of

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.539 
estimation by reducing the dragging of
the<00:02:57.570> pixels<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.079> can<00:02:58.200> occur<00:02:58.590> between<00:02:58.709> e4<00:02:59.370> gun

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549

parameters<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.209> node<00:04:12.359> in<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.750> properties

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
parameters of the node in the properties

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.090 
parameters of the node in the properties
bin<00:04:15.139> now<00:04:16.139> if<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.500> look<00:04:16.650> at<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.889> shell

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
bin now if we look at that shell

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.590 
bin now if we look at that shell
properties<00:04:17.489> bin<00:04:17.669> we<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.120> see<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:18.389> have<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
properties bin we can see we have a

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.050 
properties bin we can see we have a
variety<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.199> parameters<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.160> control<00:04:20.579> the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
variety of parameters to control the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.719 
variety of parameters to control the
first<00:04:21.359> one<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.079> method<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:23.550> this

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
first one this is the method now this

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.520 
first one this is the method now this
controls<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> actual<00:04:24.630> calculation<00:04:25.169> taking

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
controls the actual calculation taking

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.189 
controls the actual calculation taking
place<00:04:25.740> now<00:04:26.220> by<00:04:26.550> default<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.479> is<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.660> 2d<00:04:27.960> motion

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
place now by default this is a 2d motion

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.990 
place now by default this is a 2d motion
estimation<00:04:28.440> which<00:04:29.100> is<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.430> full<00:04:29.729> vector

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
estimation which is the full vector

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.360 
estimation which is the full vector
interpolation<00:04:30.930> which<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.590> used<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.039> create

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
interpolation which is used to create

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.830 
interpolation which is used to create
the<00:04:32.430> imaging<00:04:32.789> frames<00:04:33.060> from<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> accurate

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the imaging frames from the accurate

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.320 
the imaging frames from the accurate
motion<00:04:34.169> vectors<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.880> use<00:04:36.090> this

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
motion vectors now you can use this

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.180 
motion vectors now you can use this
which<00:04:36.570> is<00:04:36.750> very<00:04:36.810> time-consuming<00:04:37.229> and<00:04:37.860> the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
which is very time-consuming and the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.400 
which is very time-consuming and the
actual<00:04:38.430> full<00:04:38.759> calculation<00:04:38.940> taking<00:04:39.599> place<00:04:39.810> or

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
actual full calculation taking place or

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.890 
actual full calculation taking place or
you<00:04:40.620> can<00:04:40.800> use<00:04:41.009> the<00:04:41.190> frame<00:04:41.820> blending<00:04:42.330> method

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
you can use the frame blending method

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.020 
you can use the frame blending method
now<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> mix<00:04:44.190> between<00:04:44.280> actual<00:04:44.849> two

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
now this is a mix between actual two

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.900 
now this is a mix between actual two
frames<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.630> create<00:04:45.840> an<00:04:46.110> in-between<00:04:46.740> frame<00:04:46.949> now

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
frames to create an in-between frame now

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.790 
frames to create an in-between frame now
this<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.210> quick<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.449> render<00:04:48.900> unuseful<00:04:49.410> when

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
this is quick to render unuseful when

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.219 
this is quick to render unuseful when
tweaking<00:04:50.250> at<00:04:50.400> your<00:04:50.580> timing<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.240> your<00:04:51.300> retime

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
tweaking at your timing of your retime

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.409 
tweaking at your timing of your retime
for<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.590> your<00:04:52.800> sequence<00:04:53.280> before<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.120> go<00:04:54.240> for

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
for that your sequence before you go for

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.420 
for that your sequence before you go for
the<00:04:54.509> full<00:04:54.780> method<00:04:55.080> calculation<00:04:55.800> for<00:04:56.009> motion

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
the full method calculation for motion

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.999 
the full method calculation for motion
estimation<00:04:57.199> by<00:04:58.199> default<00:04:58.560> let's<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.889> leave

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
estimation by default let's just leave

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.779

this<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.280> motion<00:04:59.970> estimation<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:02.400> also<00:05:02.520> have

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
this to motion estimation we also have

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.080 
this to motion estimation we also have
the<00:05:02.970> timing<00:05:03.360> now<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:04.680> is<00:05:04.800> set<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.190> speed<00:05:05.789> by

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
the timing now this is set to speed by

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.779 
the timing now this is set to speed by
default<00:05:06.449> but<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.050> can<00:05:07.229> choose<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.740> retime<00:05:08.580> the

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
default but you can choose to retime the

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.240 
default but you can choose to retime the
session<00:05:09.150> by<00:05:09.419> actual<00:05:09.930> frames<00:05:10.320> but<00:05:11.010> for<00:05:11.159> this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
session by actual frames but for this

session by actual frames but for this
tutorial<00:05:11.430> we're<00:05:11.820> going<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.000> be<00:05:12.060> using<00:05:12.449> the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
tutorial we're going to be using the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.510 
tutorial we're going to be using the
speed<00:05:12.990> setting<00:05:13.289> to<00:05:13.590> retime<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.250> actual

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
speed setting to retime the actual

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.659 
speed setting to retime the actual
sequence<00:05:15.949> now<00:05:16.949> because<00:05:17.310> we're<00:05:17.490> usually

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
sequence now because we're usually

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.730 
sequence now because we're usually
natural<00:05:18.180> speed<00:05:18.659> retiming<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.440> what<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
natural speed retiming and what the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.129 
natural speed retiming and what the
frames<00:05:20.039> me<00:05:20.820> speed<00:05:21.270> parameter<00:05:21.690> is<00:05:21.750> harder<00:05:22.110> for

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
frames me speed parameter is harder for

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.200 
frames me speed parameter is harder for
us<00:05:22.380> now<00:05:22.680> by<00:05:22.919> default<00:05:23.099> this<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.550> set<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
us now by default this is set to a

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.649 
us now by default this is set to a
slowdown<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.470> 0.5<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.820> half<00:05:27.210> speed

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
slowdown of 0.5 so this is a half speed

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.469 
slowdown of 0.5 so this is a half speed
every<00:05:28.139> time<00:05:28.349> for<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.560> original<00:05:28.830> sequence

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
every time for the original sequence

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.879 
every time for the original sequence
now<00:05:30.479> let's<00:05:30.840> only<00:05:30.990> get<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.229> other<00:05:31.349> parameters

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
now let's only get the other parameters

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.399 
now let's only get the other parameters
up<00:05:32.070> there<00:05:32.310> default<00:05:32.789> settings<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.449> we<00:05:34.229> should

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
up there default settings and we should

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.350 
up there default settings and we should
get<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.560> render<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.070> this<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.789> by<00:05:35.940> showing<00:05:36.150> the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
get a render of this just by showing the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.290 
get a render of this just by showing the
actual<00:05:36.690> retiming<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:37.919> just<00:05:38.159> by<00:05:38.280> 0.5<00:05:39.030> and

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
actual retiming of this just by 0.5 and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.050 
actual retiming of this just by 0.5 and
changing<00:05:39.960> no<00:05:40.110> other<00:05:40.260> parameters<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:41.520> write

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
changing no other parameters so write

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.399 
changing no other parameters so write
the<00:05:42.180> sequence<00:05:42.510> out<00:05:42.720> or<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:43.020> can<00:05:43.169> see<00:05:43.289> the

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
the sequence out or we can see the

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.390 
the sequence out or we can see the
results<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.680> if<00:05:46.740> we<00:05:46.830> look<00:05:46.979> at<00:05:47.039> the<00:05:47.159> actual

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
results so if we look at the actual

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.550 
results so if we look at the actual
render<00:05:48.150> now<00:05:48.330> we<00:05:48.599> can<00:05:48.750> see<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.289> by<00:05:49.380> using

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
render now we can see that just by using

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.200 
render now we can see that just by using
the<00:05:49.680> default<00:05:49.860> settings<00:05:50.190> across<00:05:50.849> we've

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the default settings across we've

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.189 
the default settings across we've
actually<00:05:51.360> achieved<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:52.050> half<00:05:52.320> speed<00:05:52.710> slow<00:05:53.010> down

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
actually achieved a half speed slow down

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.330 
actually achieved a half speed slow down
alright<00:05:55.199> if<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.440> look<00:05:55.590> carefully<00:05:55.800> at<00:05:56.220> the

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
alright if you look carefully at the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.620 
alright if you look carefully at the
actual<00:05:56.580> footage<00:05:56.789> you<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.120> see<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.479> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
actual footage you can see that the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.830 
actual footage you can see that the
actual<00:05:58.020> canoe<00:05:58.409> paddle<00:05:58.919> has<00:05:59.580> got<00:06:00.060> some<00:06:00.270> flux<00:06:00.659> on

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
actual canoe paddle has got some flux on

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.420 
actual canoe paddle has got some flux on
there<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.289> pixels<00:06:01.710> are<00:06:01.800> flexing<00:06:02.220> and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
there and the pixels are flexing and

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.100 
there and the pixels are flexing and
there's<00:06:02.849> some<00:06:02.970> artifacts<00:06:03.389> occurring<00:06:03.900> where

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
there's some artifacts occurring where

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.870 
there's some artifacts occurring where
the<00:06:04.590> frames<00:06:04.889> haven't<00:06:05.280> actually<00:06:05.400> blended

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
the frames haven't actually blended

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.390 
the frames haven't actually blended
together<00:06:06.000> properly<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.470> bit<00:06:07.620> detail<00:06:08.070> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
together properly and the bit detail is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.760 
together properly and the bit detail is
off

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
off

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.469 
off
where<00:06:10.370> to<00:06:10.460> fix<00:06:10.639> this<00:06:10.759> is<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.150> we<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.389> to

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
where to fix this is that we have to

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.600 
where to fix this is that we have to
actually<00:06:11.569> apply<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.259> matter<00:06:12.770> to<00:06:13.099> the<00:06:13.220> sequence

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
actually apply a matter to the sequence

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.760 
actually apply a matter to the sequence
and<00:06:13.879> so<00:06:14.539> we<00:06:14.599> can<00:06:14.720> differentiate<00:06:15.050> between<00:06:15.410> the

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
and so we can differentiate between the

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.740 
and so we can differentiate between the
actual<00:06:15.979> foreground<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.849> background<00:06:16.879> so

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
actual foreground and the background so

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.939 
actual foreground and the background so
in<00:06:17.810> this<00:06:17.870> case<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.169> photon<00:06:18.470> with<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.650> puddle

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
in this case the photon with the puddle

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.200 
in this case the photon with the puddle
on<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:19.190> background<00:06:19.669> will<00:06:19.759> be<00:06:19.789> everything

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
on the background will be everything

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.719 
on the background will be everything
else<00:06:20.389> we<00:06:21.020> can<00:06:21.169> fix<00:06:21.379> this<00:06:21.560> problem<00:06:21.620> in<00:06:22.039> part<00:06:22.460> two

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
else we can fix this problem in part two

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.020 
else we can fix this problem in part two
of<00:06:22.879> the<00:06:23.150> corners<00:06:23.479> tutorial
