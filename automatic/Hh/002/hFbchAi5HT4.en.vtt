00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.540
 there are so many customers in the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.270
 in feeding 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.630
 everyday that really only 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.930
 in the little known and little used 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.180
 one of these that is very effective and 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.850
 useful for the organism and chlorophyll la 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 chlorophyll and the plant molecule 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.180
 the molecule that makes plants green 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.050
 a food an important molecule that 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.580
 it is also used in industry 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.239
 food just for coloring 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.640
 green drinks and jellies 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.129
 for all her with green dyes 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 denounced precisely by those row and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.710
 important to take it even from a point 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.300
 view of food every day 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.850
 daily because it has so many 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.280
 the most important properties are the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.399
 detoxification of the organism is a 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.040
 strong alkalizing serves to create in 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.170
 heavy from our body 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.840
 obviously in the reality we live 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.180
 we are subject to a high rate of 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.009
 pollution from the air that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.890
 we breathe the food we eat so 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.630
 also heavy metals in our body 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.000
 in this period they also reach 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.830
 Other high concentrations prin task 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.289
 of chlorophyll and that of kelar e 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.149
 therefore reduce the percentage of these 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.709
 heavy metals to our body 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.899
 the advice I can give is to 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.910
 take it daily in the form 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.100
 if you do not want to take supplements 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.500
 in the form of centrifugal centrifuges 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.920
 of green foods so we usually are 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.830
 used to drinking juices or making juices 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.580
 instead suggestion that I can give you of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.360
 also use and vegetables a 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.440
 green leaf with making of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.750
 centrifuged then centrifuged of 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.970
 Parsley containing another high 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.819
 chlorophyll content because they fear 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.520
 celery spinach and a nice morning 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.700
 centrifuged reactive all 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.039
 the organism purifies reactivates ours 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.140
 bowel plus gives us a good one 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.289
 stock of antioxidants for the whole 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.289
 day
