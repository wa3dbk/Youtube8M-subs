00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.029
 the quinoa as the time here is known 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.090
 like mother cereal on the tongue 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.940
 Quechua and can do many things is 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.460
 very versatile also contains a lot 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.190
 protein phosphorus magnesium calcium many 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.220
 minerals that's why it's good for the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.409
 bones and for the teeth then 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.590
 also if you really want a 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.410
 ceviche and you're worried about the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.699
 mercury in the fish then test 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.359
 This ceviche Quinoa is rich it 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.179
 The only thing you need is quinoa and 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.619
 vegetables that you're going to like 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:13.360
 chosen mate onion a lot cilantro or if 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.060
 you want to use avocado lemon parsley and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.300
 something that gives sweet that gives a flavor 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.510
 so sweetly chop a mango 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.880
 also, also 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.130
 you are going to use olive oil as 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.830
 dressing 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.140
 and a lettuce just to decorate it 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 when you go to know the one that does not to me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.650
 like to let it soak about 20 minutes in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.610
 water well soaking according to 20 minutes to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 half an hour later and the drain and the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.140
 you start to cook it sews very fast in about 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.620
 10 to 15 minutes you have to see that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.040
 do not stay whipped so it stays like that 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 interview just cooked 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.570
 then once and so we're going to start 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.330
 make the ceviche 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 let's start making the dressing 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.670
 first I also like to add a 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.010
 spoonful of coconut nectar and if not 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.110
 you have this coconut nectar can be 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.650
 also honey 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.209
 so that your dressing is something sweet 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.060
 then let's squeeze the lemons 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.650
 I also like to put an orange or 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.000
 a tangerine then lemons 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 and the tangerine 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.030
 then we will also add 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.290
 little salt either sea salt or salt 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.870
 rosita from the himalayas and also oil 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.610
 olive tree to taste but this one you're going to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.910
 put whatever you want I had already 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.830
 put something then nothing else that is the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.830
 cold pressed organic oil 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.879
 and since you have this ready you're going 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.840
 putting the onion here I already had 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.030
 part of chopped white onion but 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.450
 You can also put two kinds of 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.220
 Onion now I will also put 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.220
 these little ones 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.260
 also what you are going to use is going to be the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.470
 chopped mango 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.030
 and tomato to taste 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.250
 because I have a lot 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.250
 and of course cilantro 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 the quinoa is already cooked as you can see 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.990
 it is not beaten the grain is sold already 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.990
 cool and you're going to start stirring 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 ah 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.730
 if you want to add more seasoning is 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.100
 perfect also if you like cabbage 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.919
 fermented or the sour crowe I have the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.290

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.660
 like to add since it is fermented 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.210

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.449

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.949
 I'll accompany it with the fermented cabbage 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.949
 and the quinoa ceviche 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.889
