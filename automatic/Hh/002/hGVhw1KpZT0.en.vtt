00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
nothing that's what we're going to do I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.849 
nothing that's what we're going to do I
like<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.150> start<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> top<00:02:49.109> end<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:49.739> I

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
like to start with the top end because I

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.099 
like to start with the top end because I
like<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.130> kind<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.400> open<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.819> open<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> thing

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
like to kind of open the open the thing

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.030 
like to kind of open the open the thing
up<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:53.060> look<00:02:54.060> at<00:02:54.269> your<00:02:54.450> acoustic<00:02:55.049> exciter<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
up so look at your acoustic exciter and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
up so look at your acoustic exciter and
then<00:02:56.819> simply<00:02:57.389> turn<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.650> high<00:02:59.220> tune<00:02:59.870> all<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
then simply turn the high tune all the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.280 
then simply turn the high tune all the
way<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.349> zero<00:03:01.769> that's<00:03:02.160> off<00:03:02.780> take<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:03.810> high

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
way to zero that's off take your high

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.190 
way to zero that's off take your high
blend<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.160> turn<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.519> all<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.000> way<00:03:06.150> up<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:07.139> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
blend and turn it all the way up all the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.280 
blend and turn it all the way up all the
way<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.400> reason<00:03:08.819> we<00:03:09.209> turn<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.569> all<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:09.989> up

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
way the reason we turn it all the way up

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.099 
way the reason we turn it all the way up
is<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.739> want<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.220> effect<00:03:11.690> exaggerated<00:03:12.690> because

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
is I want the effect exaggerated because

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.559 
is I want the effect exaggerated because
we're<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> look<00:03:13.769> for<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.910> frequency

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
we're going to look for the frequency

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.620 
we're going to look for the frequency
that<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.380> want<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.919> I<00:03:16.980> want<00:03:17.130> that

I'm going to turn the low blend all the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.090 
I'm going to turn the low blend all the
way<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:18.090> low<00:04:18.690> tune<00:04:19.049> all<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.709> way<00:04:19.860> off
