00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.909

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.930
 what a name 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.789
 That's not his real name 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.269
 On what did you baptize? 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.979
 been 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.570
 and if the miss is not too comfortable 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.679
 then maybe it even has that 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.579
 friendliness with these names 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.770

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.080
 I already told him how to get it 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.789
 Are you growing up to talk to me ? 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.100
 child not quite clever in the head or 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.310
 it just moved and so loud 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.509
 she just has some fear at the moment 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.009
 maybe I may exceptionally for 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.590
 you answer she is one 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.090
 environment not used to it is neither 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.310
 foreign still moved 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.409
 they always said exactly what she thinks 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.130
 heidi has never had so much 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 lied why are you bumping into me but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.840
 Of course heidi also has one 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.189
 purchase they took is adelheid it is 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.629
 named after her mother 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.280
 my late sister adelheid 

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:44.289
 but we never called her that 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.330
 That's why she does not stop there 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.800
 shorter and shouts better aha me 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.599
 I already understand a very good name 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.179
 can not help but have her 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.709
 misunderstood me not misunderstood 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.920
 Yes, I was looking for a playmate 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.690
 clear old she is not I 12 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.399
 said explicitly that me 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.869
 looking for someone who is able to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.080
 to study more clearly 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.879
 who has grown spiritually what it is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 Definitely that understands very quickly 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.420
 she is a very clever child 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.739
 then very alive i know is something 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.599
 small but that is deceptive 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.610
 I do not know, I do not believe it 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.140
 is a little over ten or I know it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.290
 Grandfather said I am eight years old 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.610
 old the child is only eight years old 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.840
 terribly busy but not always 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.580
 it's just bad when you're eight 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.110
 the door she is four years younger than 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.310
 it was clear what should the two well 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.200
 start with each other 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.269
 but stop is particularly wise for 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.950
 her age really and what book 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.580
 We have studies for our readers 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.069
 used 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.909
 i have never had a book i believe 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.470
 Now I'm about to go down 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.730

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.990

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.210

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.790
 Do you say so in truth and so on 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.440
 something in our home environment what should 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.630
 become so out of you because so much uneducated 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.640
