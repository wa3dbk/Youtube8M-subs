00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.070 
bangs I have a tutorial on how I curl my
bangs<00:04:29.010> if<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.910> method<00:04:30.360> seems<00:04:30.780> kind<00:04:31.050> of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
bangs if this method seems kind of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.620 
bangs if this method seems kind of
confusing<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:32.850> my<00:04:33.060> bangs<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.510> be

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
confusing but I like my bangs to be

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.570 
confusing but I like my bangs to be
blended<00:04:34.080> into<00:04:34.260> my<00:04:34.500> hair<00:04:34.740> instead<00:04:35.250> of<00:04:35.400> them

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
blended into my hair instead of them

being awkwardly straight when my hair is
curly<00:04:47.720> continue<00:04:48.720> curling<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.260> other<00:04:49.440> side<00:04:49.740> of

curly continue curling the other side of
your<00:04:50.100> hair<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.640> then<00:04:51.110> don't<00:04:52.110> forget<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.470> also

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
your hair and then don't forget to also

frame your face on the other side by

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.580 
frame your face on the other side by
curling<00:04:54.900> closer<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.650> root<00:05:00.470> after<00:05:01.470> you're

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
curling closer to the root after you're

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.110 
curling closer to the root after you're
done<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.100> curling<00:05:02.430> process<00:05:02.910> you<00:05:03.090> can

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
done with the curling process you can

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.690 
done with the curling process you can
either<00:05:03.360> use<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.660> comb<00:05:03.990> or<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.380> tend<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.400> use<00:05:05.460> my

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
either use a comb or I tend to use my

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.750 
either use a comb or I tend to use my
fingers<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.120> gently<00:05:06.900> loosen<00:05:07.890> up<00:05:08.010> my<00:05:08.190> curls<00:05:08.490> and

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
fingers to gently loosen up my curls and

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.800 
fingers to gently loosen up my curls and
make<00:05:08.910> them<00:05:09.120> look<00:05:09.330> really<00:05:10.080> natural<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.740> subtle

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
make them look really natural and subtle

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.390 
make them look really natural and subtle
so<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:12.840> start<00:05:13.320> by<00:05:13.440> brushing<00:05:13.650> through<00:05:14.160> and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
so I start by brushing through and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.850 
so I start by brushing through and
pulling<00:05:14.730> down<00:05:14.940> with<00:05:15.150> my<00:05:15.300> fingers<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.990> then

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
pulling down with my fingers and then

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.430 
pulling down with my fingers and then
once<00:05:17.460> I've<00:05:17.790> done<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.630> tend<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.110> take<00:05:19.260> out

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
once I've done that I tend to take out

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.860 
once I've done that I tend to take out
my<00:05:19.470> comb<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.070> just<00:05:20.340> brush<00:05:20.550> out<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:21.090> tips<00:05:21.720> of

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
my comb and just brush out the tips of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:36.200 
my comb and just brush out the tips of
my<00:05:21.930> hair
