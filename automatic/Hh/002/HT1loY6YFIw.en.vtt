oh right faceball is off so let's put
this<00:02:46.000> thing<00:02:46.269> together<00:02:49.049> goes<00:02:50.049> oh<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:50.769> got<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
this thing together goes oh it got the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.470 
this thing together goes oh it got the
energy<00:02:52.120> ring<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.470> face<00:02:56.739> bolt

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
energy ring on like so the face bolt

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.460 
energy ring on like so the face bolt
then<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.750> put<00:02:59.080> the<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:03.250> spin<00:03:03.760> track<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.959> under

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
this this one's kind of hard okay then

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.740
