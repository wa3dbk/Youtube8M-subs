 hi guys roxanne 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.129
 can see I put the intro on me 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.880
 because I already have a good computer 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.700
 I wanted to show this to 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.270
 what I did is a little caste 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.130
 rubber and this character is a fairy who 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.939
 well he asked me for you about 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.950
 months ago and had not been able 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.660
 teach them because 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.780
 of the computer that no longer served well 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 how good this doll is made of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.700
 rubber paste with all the dolls 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.070
 what do I do and I have to say it's one of 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.340
 those that most resemble and with which more 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 happy has been because 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.630
 If I really liked how it came out but good 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 I show you also I made this flower 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 if you're down here and that does it 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.460
 with some wilt brand cutters 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.650
 Ons or sell a set that has 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 and it does not cost so expensive so yes 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.900
 some undo technique 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.230
 look for it if it works well enough 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.380

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.509

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.759
 very pretty only that I think you 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.530
 I put my legs and arms a little 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.030
 skinny but good 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.030
 and this is peace 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.800

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.340
