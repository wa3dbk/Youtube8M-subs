00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 

now<00:02:01.710> somebody's<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.430> remember<00:02:02.850> some<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.180> don't

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
now somebody's I remember some I don't

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.790 
now somebody's I remember some I don't
I'm<00:02:03.540> learning<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.790> stuff<00:02:09.380> go<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.440> another

groom

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.770 

so<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.760> core<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.570> says

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so this is the core because it says

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.950 
so this is the core because it says
record<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.500> stuff<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.600> see<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:22.810> can

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
record and stuff so you see that we can

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.070 
record and stuff so you see that we can
record<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.740> stuff<00:02:24.600> don't<00:02:25.600> turn<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.020> alone<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
record and stuff don't turn up alone and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
record and stuff don't turn up alone and
this<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.620> effective<00:02:30.310> system<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.090> know<00:02:31.330> that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
this is the effective system I know that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.850 
this is the effective system I know that
so<00:02:32.200> stop<00:02:32.530> playing<00:02:33.460> with<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.350> your<00:02:35.500> FX
