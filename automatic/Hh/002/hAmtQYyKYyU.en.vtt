00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the voice area there with 22 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
 here is a way to improve the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.429
 camera then there is a mold both 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.519
 Camera g3 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.019
 this from here like g2 then the thing 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.830
 that many people missed that in this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.270
 bed she does not shoot at 60fps then show 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.410
 here for you that with this motto you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.410
 was 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 You have the option here, you'll be glad of your sgps. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.859
 Furthermore it has the standard option and 30 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.300
 also has the law slow motion at 120 fps 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.530
 hd 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 so just show that also the speed 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 the camera that gives an improved display 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.989
 that focus put the object here two 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.840
 ways do not feel the lack of g3 camera 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.239
 then the first is by touching the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 then hides screen buttons 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 then you touch it at a point it focuses and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.489
 take photo both sporting very fast only 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 touch locates in the photo 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.409
 the other method button here we go 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.900
 velocity 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 they may be very fast have a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.729
 improved in speed compared to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.640
 standard camera and g3 that mold gets 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.170
 anyone and it's g3 a shock 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.759
 when to you 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 else I was low it is also 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.830
 pasted video that gives a good improvement 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.799
 with this mole and remembering that only 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.110
 works in g3 homs then it can be the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.990
 optimus wants me to be using you here 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.840
 Claudia 3 for anyone with any 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.119
 clothing based on g2 in both projects and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 two flex there is that here the camera 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.189
 improved g2 is also not sold in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 options 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.670
 the first change to iso that by default 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.799
 for 800 air 1,600 and also multifoco 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.270
 was improved there that I will show with 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.159
 several points there with you can see 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 How do I focus here? 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.689
 has been improved there is option four 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.049
 cars that do not have a standard of 2 and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.310
 also there is the option in slow motion 120 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.770
 fps it 's very cool 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.260
 a slow camera although the highlight 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.880
 speed though it checks fast 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.860
 like that of g3 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.319
 I'll start slower, I'll go 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.180
 increasing speed to see if she 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:29.680
 can be very fast 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.340
 so it's another advantage of this camera and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 leave in the pictures taken then remembering 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.730
 which are two different cameras one in 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.069
 g3 camera and two others also have the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.470
 focus but that also has there in the g3 bed 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.130
 May you have a picture of your 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.720
 really cool 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.150
 so whoever wants to install has two 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.370
 files in the description for those who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.569
 have with the g2 camera in a stock 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 of g2o in gt pro flex you will use this 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.690
 file and for those who have the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.190
 corpflex the ultimate flex of g3 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.430
 so you're going to use the camera file 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.900
 of g3 you choose 12 there low enters the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:18.040
 ring covers that in the case using wfp 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.670
 2.700 such you do not have to do anything alone 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.950
 will install here file 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.519
 in my case I will select the camera from 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:33.390
 g3 just pull it out it will be there 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.390
 tells you which version you are using 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.290
 when you finish haiti cash and 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.450
 must cash and update the files of the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.739
 camera and cleaned the files those 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.940
 were saved in the camera file 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.380
 previous 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.780
 then it is good to avoid 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.380
 incompatibilities with the archives of the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.519
 camera and when der burgh e vai 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.400
 take a little longer 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.650
 I said cash impulse so will wait 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.410
 it update the files in case they are 22 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.150
 using reminding that you have to 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.019
 to choose another case it's good that I 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.139
 I have here 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.260
 it comes with two g20 cameras of 3 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:17.169
 so if you're with another 1 you 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.109
 will only use the file from the next camera 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.229
 that rome and when he finishes 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.229
 on here 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.770
 it will start on systems already will be 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.410
 with the camera updated 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.000
 Good, that's it, and you 're done. 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.650
 was normalized 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.260
 and if you liked the tip of how to improve 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.200
 the camera in g2 do not forget that they clicked 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.700
 I like it down there, it helps the channel a lot. 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.920
 and if you are not yet registered click 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.930
 do not write and if you follow new 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.340
 videos here and there g 2 channel staff 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.310
 and then I'll come back with more tips 11 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.660
 molds and either in the loot for there g 2 spoke 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.660
 guys until the next
