00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it all the way it needs to be maybe

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.730 
it all the way it needs to be maybe
cooked<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.979> 60%<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.260> still<00:01:13.409> cut<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
