well<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:00.960> cut<00:00:01.290> out<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> quarter-inch<00:00:02.040> thick

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
well I cut out a quarter-inch thick

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.410 
well I cut out a quarter-inch thick
plywood<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.240> can<00:00:03.389> see<00:00:03.570> it<00:00:03.659> right<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:03.840> and

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
plywood you can see it right here and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.490 
plywood you can see it right here and
that's<00:00:06.420> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.690> go<00:00:06.810> behind<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.200> drywall

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
that's going to go behind the drywall

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.080 
that's going to go behind the drywall
and<00:00:08.250> there's<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.639> be<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.760> frame<00:00:09.059> around

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and there's going to be a frame around

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.140 
and there's going to be a frame around
this<00:00:09.630> plywood<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.550> so<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.849> see<00:00:12.030> it's

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
this plywood and so you can see it's

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.320 
this plywood and so you can see it's
enough<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.099> I<00:00:14.099> could<00:00:14.219> open<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.730> door<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
enough that I could open up the door and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.510 
enough that I could open up the door and
then<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> piece<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:17.789> cut<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.570> cannot

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
then the piece that was cut out I cannot

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.300 
then the piece that was cut out I cannot
basically<00:00:20.520> make<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> frame<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:22.710> with

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
basically make a frame around it with

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609 
basically make a frame around it with
some<00:00:23.490> trim<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.300> hinge<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:25.260> into<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
some trim on a hinge going into this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.670 
some trim on a hinge going into this
stuff<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.310> arm<00:00:27.050> which<00:00:28.050> will<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.289> nailed<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
stuff here arm which will be nailed to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.410 
stuff here arm which will be nailed to
other<00:00:29.010> boards<00:00:29.460> behind<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.029> I'll<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
other boards behind it like I'll have a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.150 
other boards behind it like I'll have a
frame<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:31.050> around<00:00:31.380> us<00:00:31.969> heavy<00:00:32.969> planking<00:00:33.540> on

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
frame all around us heavy planking on

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.670 
frame all around us heavy planking on
pretended<00:00:35.160> piece<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.610> goes<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> inside

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
pretended piece that goes on the inside

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.910 
pretended piece that goes on the inside
here<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.640> put<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> mirror<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
here I can put the mirror to it with a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000 
here I can put the mirror to it with a
trim<00:00:41.250> around<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> open<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:43.010> and

then you open up that door that's how

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.200 
then you open up that door that's how
I'll<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.680> should<00:00:49.680> workout<00:00:50.210> time

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
I'll do it so should workout time

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
I'll do it so should workout time
consuming<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.710> working<00:00:56.840> well<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> got

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
words to this plywood and then I can

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.910 
words to this plywood and then I can
bolt<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> whole<00:02:09.569> cabinet<00:02:10.110> into<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.530> Frank

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
bolt the whole cabinet into this Frank

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.470 
bolt the whole cabinet into this Frank
which<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:11.489> pretty<00:02:11.670> heavy<00:02:11.940> wood<00:02:12.209> that's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
which is some pretty heavy wood that's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.050 
which is some pretty heavy wood that's
screwed<00:02:12.810> in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
screwed in

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.010 
screwed in
to<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:15.040> framing<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> house<00:02:15.790> too<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.150> that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
to the framing of the house too so that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.870 
to the framing of the house too so that
should<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.230> pretty<00:02:17.319> solid<00:02:19.739> ok<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.520> cut<00:02:21.849> out

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
should be pretty solid ok so I cut out

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.580 
should be pretty solid ok so I cut out
the<00:02:22.120> hole<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.690> I'm<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.020> get<00:02:23.140> some<00:02:23.319> trim

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
the hole and I'm going to get some trim

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.800 
the hole and I'm going to get some trim
for<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.190> first<00:02:24.510> gluing<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.599> wood

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
for this but first gluing this wood

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.229 
for this but first gluing this wood
Gorilla<00:02:26.140> Glue<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> drywall<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.819> actually

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
Gorilla Glue so the drywall is actually

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.089 
Gorilla Glue so the drywall is actually
a<00:02:28.830> glue<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.900> mm<00:02:31.900> plywood<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:32.800> behind

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
a glue to the mm plywood that's behind

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.070 
a glue to the mm plywood that's behind
it<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:34.030> there's<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.510> trim<00:02:34.840> piece

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
it but there's going to be a trim piece

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.630 
it but there's going to be a trim piece
that's<00:02:35.319> going<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.530> wrap<00:02:35.769> around<00:02:35.980> grip<00:02:36.519> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that's going to wrap around grip the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
that's going to wrap around grip the
whole<00:02:36.790> thing<00:02:37.060> anyway<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.540> i'll<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.800> getting

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
whole thing anyway so i'll be getting

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.890 
whole thing anyway so i'll be getting
that<00:02:39.069> next<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.480> know<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.720> thing

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that next but then you know the thing

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.949 
that next but then you know the thing
goes<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:42.130> goes<00:02:42.400> behind<00:02:42.880> there<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
goes this goes behind there and the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.229 
goes this goes behind there and the
mirror<00:02:44.170> will<00:02:44.290> go<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.800> front<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.239> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
mirror will go right in front of it that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.750 
mirror will go right in front of it that
mean<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> cabinet<00:02:47.290> goes<00:02:47.410> behind<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.980> door

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
mean the cabinet goes behind that door

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.120 
mean the cabinet goes behind that door
is<00:02:48.910> cut<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.380> open<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.799> up<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
is cut out so you can open it up and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.670 
is cut out so you can open it up and
then<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.910> mirror<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.330> go<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.630> front<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.930> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.380 

well<00:02:56.680> basically<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.430> almost<00:02:57.819> done<00:02:58.120> um

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
well basically this is almost done um

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.930 
well basically this is almost done um
I'm<00:02:59.019> going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> get<00:02:59.440> the<00:03:00.069> trim<00:03:00.370> piece<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.819> go

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
I'm going to get the trim piece to go

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.430 
I'm going to get the trim piece to go
wrap<00:03:01.209> around<00:03:01.569> here<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.410> you

wrap around here and actually like you
saw<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.769> glued<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:04.060> drywall<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:06.010> think

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
saw a glued the drywall to the I think

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.750 
saw a glued the drywall to the I think
it's<00:03:06.819> 38<00:03:07.560> plywood<00:03:08.560> actual<00:03:09.099> plywood<00:03:09.549> saw<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
it's 38 plywood actual plywood saw a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's 38 plywood actual plywood saw a
particle<00:03:10.299> board<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.799> um<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.880> placed

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
particle board and um this just placed

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.670 
particle board and um this just placed
in<00:03:13.390> here<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.630> it's<00:03:13.720> in<00:03:13.840> there<00:03:13.959> pretty<00:03:13.989> solid

if you look on the inside it's not it
didn't<00:03:38.650> take<00:03:38.680> up<00:03:38.950> too<00:03:39.100> much<00:03:39.130> room<00:03:39.340> now<00:03:40.239> what<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
didn't take up too much room now what I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.390 
didn't take up too much room now what I
could<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.400> could<00:03:42.579> take<00:03:42.790> arm<00:03:44.400> some

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
could do to is I could take arm some

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.050 
could do to is I could take arm some
like<00:03:46.239> um<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:47.799> know<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.010> shower<00:03:48.340> stuff<00:03:48.790> they

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
like um you know that shower stuff they

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.699 
like um you know that shower stuff they
get<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.480> white<00:03:49.750> board<00:03:50.109> that's<00:03:50.470> for<00:03:50.650> the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
get the white board that's for the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.129 
get the white board that's for the
showers<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:52.030> glue<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.299> on<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.780> inside

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
showers and just glue it on the inside

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.080 
showers and just glue it on the inside
of<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:54.519> would<00:03:54.639> never<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.940> that

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
of this and you would never know that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.390 
of this and you would never know that
this<00:03:55.450> was<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> cabinet<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.650> here<00:03:56.799> we<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.220> think

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
this was a cabinet in here we just think

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.580 
this was a cabinet in here we just think
it's<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:58.359> wouldn't<00:03:58.630> realize<00:03:58.930> what<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.410> it

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it's you wouldn't realize what it is it

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.490 
it's you wouldn't realize what it is it
just<00:03:59.769> be<00:03:59.920> white<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.690> I'll<00:04:01.690> probably<00:04:01.900> do<00:04:02.230> that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
just be white so I'll probably do that

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.590 
just be white so I'll probably do that
and<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:04.540> other<00:04:04.569> thing<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:07.049> mirror<00:04:09.480> what<00:04:10.480> I'm

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
and the other thing is mirror what I'm

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.960 
and the other thing is mirror what I'm
going<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.780> do<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:12.010> got<00:04:12.910> two<00:04:13.120> boards<00:04:13.540> here<00:04:13.720> and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
go around here too but not a hundred

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.070 
go around here too but not a hundred
percent<00:04:48.100> maybe<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.880> know<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.450> could<00:04:49.630> be<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.780> type

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
percent maybe I know it could be a type

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.490 
percent maybe I know it could be a type
of<00:04:50.790> rubber<00:04:51.790> tape<00:04:52.150> or<00:04:52.450> something<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.350> go

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
of rubber tape or something just to go

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.740 
of rubber tape or something just to go
around<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.010> glue<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.220> on<00:04:54.490> there<00:04:54.760> but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
around there and glue it on there but

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.920 
around there and glue it on there but
that's<00:04:56.290> about<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.700> know<00:04:57.850> works<00:04:58.660> good

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
that's about it so you know works good

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.290 
that's about it so you know works good
and<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:02.230> when<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:03.100> going<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.400> be<00:05:03.520> bolted<00:05:04.150> in

and and when it's going to be bolted in
up<00:05:04.510> here<00:05:04.870> on<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.320> top<00:05:05.350> because<00:05:06.040> there's<00:05:06.280> like

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
up here on the top because there's like

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.320

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
the side so you know the thing is it'll

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.070 
the side so you know the thing is it'll
be<00:05:17.680> pretty<00:05:17.890> much<00:05:18.220> out<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.660> that<00:05:19.660> will<00:05:19.810> really

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
be pretty much out of that will really

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.530 
be pretty much out of that will really
see<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.550> should<00:05:21.790> work<00:05:21.940> out<00:05:22.180> that's

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
see it so it should work out that's

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.780
