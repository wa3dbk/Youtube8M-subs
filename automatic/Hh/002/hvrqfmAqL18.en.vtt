00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.090 
down little set screws one thing I
really<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.140> about<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.620> thing<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
really like about this thing is the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.880 
really like about this thing is the
trigger<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.910> trigger<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.690> unbelievable<00:02:54.590> like

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
trigger the trigger is unbelievable like

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.220 
trigger the trigger is unbelievable like
when<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:55.489> say<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:56.060> good<00:02:56.360> trigger<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.959> like

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
when they say a good trigger is like

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.920 
when they say a good trigger is like
pulling<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.250> piece<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.610> glass<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.269> like<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
pulling on a piece of glass I like the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
pulling on a piece of glass I like the
glass<00:03:00.140> rod<00:03:00.410> until<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.920> breaks<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.640> snaps

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
glass rod until it breaks and just snaps

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.910 
glass rod until it breaks and just snaps
I<00:03:02.300> think<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.170> closest<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.650> get

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
I think that's the closest you can get

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.340 
I think that's the closest you can get
to<00:03:03.980> an<00:03:04.370> unmodified<00:03:04.760> stock<00:03:05.510> trigger<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:06.140> this

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to an unmodified stock trigger like this

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.850 
to an unmodified stock trigger like this
I<00:03:06.560> mean<00:03:07.090> it's<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.180> great<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.870> love<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.200> you'll

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
I mean it's just great I love it you'll

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.710 
I mean it's just great I love it you'll
see<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.459> trigger<00:03:10.670> stop<00:03:10.970> right<00:03:11.180> there

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
see the trigger stop right there

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.380 
see the trigger stop right there
and<00:03:11.870> that's<00:03:12.459> exactly<00:03:13.459> when<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.180> trigger

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and that's exactly when the trigger

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.190 
and that's exactly when the trigger
releases<00:03:14.780> I've<00:03:15.700> given<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.090> top<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.110> my

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
before they thought the trigger was

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.360 
before they thought the trigger was
gonna<00:03:26.360> fall<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:27.380> because<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.769> was<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:27.980> crisp

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it drops the hammer before you think it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.339 
it drops the hammer before you think it
really<00:03:41.790> should<00:03:42.090> unless<00:03:42.630> you're<00:03:42.840> used<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.140> it

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349
