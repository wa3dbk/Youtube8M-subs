you buy this inflatable boat so over
here<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.510> bag<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
here this is actually the bag that the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.359 
here this is actually the bag that the
boat<00:00:23.220> comes<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:25.320> big<00:00:25.500> bag<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
boat comes in a pretty big bag it's a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.929 
boat comes in a pretty big bag it's a
big<00:00:26.580> duffle<00:00:26.910> bag<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:28.519> any<00:00:29.519> case<00:00:29.730> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
big duffle bag you can see any case this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.490 
big duffle bag you can see any case this
is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.210> size<00:00:30.420> I'd<00:00:30.689> say<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> probably<00:00:31.380> weighs

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is the size I'd say it probably weighs

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700 
is the size I'd say it probably weighs
about<00:00:32.210> 35<00:00:33.210> 40<00:00:33.750> pounds<00:00:34.110> maybe<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.530> just

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
about 35 40 pounds maybe and they just

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.930 
about 35 40 pounds maybe and they just
quickly<00:00:35.340> show<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:39.170> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.760> this<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
quickly show you what this is this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
quickly show you what this is this is
just<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.540> paddle<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.260> pretty<00:00:43.559> simple

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
just the paddle it's pretty simple

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.630 
just the paddle it's pretty simple
self-explanatory<00:00:45.200> I<00:00:46.200> guess<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.460> with

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
self-explanatory I guess all you do with

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
self-explanatory I guess all you do with
this<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.059> pop<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this you just pop it in like this this

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.270 
this you just pop it in like this this
end<00:00:50.399> goes<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:52.530> course<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.039> two

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
end goes on here of course you have two

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:07.910 
end goes on here of course you have two
of<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.520> paddles<00:00:54.059> so<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of these paddles so you know so it's a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.090 
of these paddles so you know so it's a
pretty<00:01:08.130> long<00:01:08.340> thing<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> hand

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
pretty long thing so so this is the hand

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.830 
pretty long thing so so this is the hand
pump<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> came<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> actually<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> guess

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
pump that came with the actually I guess

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.630 
pump that came with the actually I guess
it's<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> foot<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.590> hand<00:01:16.950> pump<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
it's more of a foot and hand pump that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.920 
it's more of a foot and hand pump that
came<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> boat<00:01:18.830> it's<00:01:19.830> okay<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
came with a boat it's okay it actually I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
came with a boat it's okay it actually I
mean<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> works<00:01:22.560> pretty<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.909> has

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
mean it works pretty well if you it has

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
mean it works pretty well if you it has
it's<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> double<00:01:25.470> pumps<00:01:25.890> like

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it's like one of the double pumps like

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's like one of the double pumps like
when<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> push<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.390> blows<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.720> air<00:01:27.930> when

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
when you push in it blows out air when

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550 
when you push in it blows out air when
you<00:01:28.680> pull<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:29.939> blows<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.509> air<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you pull it it also blows out air so it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.840 
you pull it it also blows out air so it
actually<00:01:31.740> works<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.159> well<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> only

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
actually works pretty well the only

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
actually works pretty well the only
thing<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.659> pump<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
thing is with this pump is that if you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
thing is with this pump is that if you
if<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.700> pumping<00:01:36.090> too<00:01:36.270> hard<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.869> really

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
if you're pumping too hard it's really

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
if you're pumping too hard it's really
easy<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.799> actually<00:01:38.100> pull<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.549> entire

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
easy to like actually pull this entire

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.630 
easy to like actually pull this entire
chamber<00:01:39.270> off<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.049> I've<00:01:41.009> done<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.310> three<00:01:41.549> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
chamber off and I've done that three or

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
chamber off and I've done that three or
four<00:01:41.670> times<00:01:42.000> until<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.479> realized<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.079> take<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
four times until I realized to take it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.630 
four times until I realized to take it
slow<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.759> does<00:01:45.060> work<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> recommend

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
slow but this does work but I recommend

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.219 
slow but this does work but I recommend
that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.820> buy<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> electric<00:01:48.750> pump<00:01:49.020> because

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that you buy the electric pump because

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.190 
that you buy the electric pump because
it<00:01:49.409> works<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:49.890> faster<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.810> anyway<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> use

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it works a lot faster so anyway I use

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
it works a lot faster so anyway I use
them<00:01:52.439> both<00:01:52.619> interchangeably<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
them both interchangeably but the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.749 
them both interchangeably but the
electric<00:01:54.689> pumps<00:01:55.020> definitely<00:01:55.920> faster<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.549> wife

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
electric pumps definitely faster my wife

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.060 
electric pumps definitely faster my wife
reminded<00:01:57.299> me<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.110> does<00:01:58.409> come<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.890> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reminded me that this does come with a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.209 
reminded me that this does come with a
manual<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.960> mean<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> think

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
manual so I mean I don't really think

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
manual so I mean I don't really think
you'll<00:02:02.490> need<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.299> pretty<00:02:03.450> easy

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you'll need it because it's pretty easy

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
you'll need it because it's pretty easy
to<00:02:03.930> figure<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.979> far<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.219> inflating<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
to figure out as far as inflating the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.320 
to figure out as far as inflating the
boat<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.420> boat<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:06.780> three<00:02:07.259> air<00:02:07.500> chambers<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
boat the boat has three air chambers the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.059 
boat the boat has three air chambers the
first<00:02:09.599> air<00:02:09.840> chambers<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> bottom

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
first air chambers on the bottom

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.280 
first air chambers on the bottom
second<00:02:11.819> ones<00:02:11.969> the<00:02:12.239> middle<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.749> the<00:02:13.049> third

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
second ones the middle one the third

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.440 
second ones the middle one the third
ones<00:02:13.499> outside<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.099> basically<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.609> inflate<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
ones outside and basically to inflate it

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.449 
ones outside and basically to inflate it
you<00:02:15.810> start<00:02:16.109> with<00:02:16.260> number<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.069> then<00:02:17.310> work

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
you start with number one and then work

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.550 
you start with number one and then work
your<00:02:17.639> way<00:02:17.700> outward<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.389> that's<00:02:19.290> pretty

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
your way outward and that's pretty

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.770 
your way outward and that's pretty
simple<00:02:19.859> so<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.879> gonna<00:02:21.030> start<00:02:21.239> working<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.659> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
simple so I'm gonna start working on the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:49.230 
simple so I'm gonna start working on the
inflation<00:02:22.139> and<00:02:22.590> then

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.990 

not<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> boat<00:02:50.050> inflated<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.680> didn't<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.160> quite

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
not the boat inflated I didn't go quite

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.570 
not the boat inflated I didn't go quite
as<00:02:52.030> stout<00:02:52.690> as<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.440> would<00:02:53.740> normally<00:02:54.010> because

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
as stout as I would normally because

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.650 
as stout as I would normally because
actually<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.940> think<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.210> getting<00:02:55.420> ready<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
actually I think it's getting ready to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.990 
actually I think it's getting ready to
rain<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.990> me<00:02:56.290> here<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.860> anyway<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.730> see

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
rain on me here so anyway you can see

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.180 
rain on me here so anyway you can see
the<00:02:58.180> three<00:02:58.390> chambers<00:02:58.810> are<00:02:58.930> full<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.410> wanted<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
with three seats that I've not inflated

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.030 
with three seats that I've not inflated
yet<00:03:46.300> I'll<00:03:46.450> do<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.750> now<00:03:46.990> but<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.680> got<00:03:47.800> three

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
yet I'll do that now but it's got three

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.860 
yet I'll do that now but it's got three
seats<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:48.580> let<00:03:48.820> me<00:03:48.910> get<00:03:49.060> these<00:03:49.180> inflated<00:03:49.720> and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
seats so let me get these inflated and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.700 
seats so let me get these inflated and
I'll<00:03:50.020> install<00:03:50.380> them<00:03:50.530> for<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.770> guys<00:03:52.710> I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
I'll install them for you guys I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.400 
I'll install them for you guys I
actually<00:03:53.860> think<00:03:54.160> it's<00:03:54.370> easier<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:55.290> pump<00:03:56.290> it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
actually think it's easier to pump it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.230 
actually think it's easier to pump it
with<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> hand<00:03:56.860> pump<00:03:57.100> than<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.520> electric<00:03:57.970> pump

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
with a hand pump than the electric pump

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.510 
with a hand pump than the electric pump
it's<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:59.320> know<00:03:59.410> why<00:03:59.560> but<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.400> in

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
it's I don't know why but it is so in

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.180 
it's I don't know why but it is so in
case

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.850 

this<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.519> last<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> center<00:04:07.650> seat

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
this is the last this is a center seat

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.979 
this is the last this is a center seat
that<00:04:08.069> I'm<00:04:08.159> inflating<00:04:08.730> here<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.840> see

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
that I'm inflating here you can see

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.629 
that I'm inflating here you can see
there's<00:04:16.229> three<00:04:16.470> seats<00:04:16.799> these<00:04:17.190> are<00:04:17.370> actually

look<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.570> firm<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.930> will<00:04:22.290> be<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.650> real<00:04:23.100> life

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
look as firm as it will be in real life

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.420 
look as firm as it will be in real life
because<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.180> didn't<00:04:24.930> inflate<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.440> completely

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
because I didn't inflate it completely

marine<00:05:48.840> battery<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.740> bought<00:05:50.039> this<00:05:50.190> at<00:05:50.400> Walmart

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
marine battery I bought this at Walmart

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.210 
marine battery I bought this at Walmart
and<00:05:51.200> roughly<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.320> way<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.560> works<00:05:52.889> with

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
and roughly the way this works with

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.279 
and roughly the way this works with
these<00:05:53.400> motors<00:05:53.849> at<00:05:54.450> least<00:05:54.630> this<00:05:54.750> is<00:05:54.930> how<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.200> was

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
these motors at least this is how it was

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.770 
these motors at least this is how it was
explained<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.860> me<00:05:55.950> like<00:05:56.669> this<00:05:56.820> is<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.000> thirty

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
explained to me like this is a thirty

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.040 
explained to me like this is a thirty
pound<00:05:58.320> thrust<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:59.220> thirty<00:05:59.820> pound<00:06:00.090> thrust<00:06:00.630> pulls

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
pound thrust a thirty pound thrust pulls

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.969 
pound thrust a thirty pound thrust pulls
about<00:06:01.410> 30<00:06:01.919> amp<00:06:02.220> hours<00:06:03.080> each<00:06:04.080> hour<00:06:04.410> on<00:06:04.800> its

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
about 30 amp hours each hour on its

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.719 
about 30 amp hours each hour on its
highest<00:06:05.400> setting<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.419> if<00:06:06.479> you<00:06:06.570> get<00:06:06.720> a<00:06:06.830> 40<00:06:07.830> or<00:06:07.860> 50

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
highest setting so if you get a 40 or 50

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.879 
highest setting so if you get a 40 or 50
it's<00:06:08.880> going<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.090> pull<00:06:09.360> 40<00:06:09.720> amps<00:06:10.050> or<00:06:10.139> 50<00:06:10.470> amps<00:06:10.770> on

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
it's going to pull 40 amps or 50 amps on

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's going to pull 40 amps or 50 amps on
the<00:06:10.949> highest<00:06:11.130> setting<00:06:11.580> in<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.300> longest<00:06:12.750> that

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
the highest setting in the longest that

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.469 
the highest setting in the longest that
we've<00:06:13.020> had<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.409> boat<00:06:13.590> out<00:06:14.000> my<00:06:15.000> wife<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.419> I

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
the three of us went out I think we were

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
and a half hours that was about as long

also you're going to need a battery

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.880 
also you're going to need a battery
charger<00:06:28.920> a<00:06:29.880> speed<00:06:30.480> charger<00:06:30.960> or<00:06:31.200> trickle

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
charger a speed charger or trickle

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.160 
charger a speed charger or trickle
charge<00:06:32.130> something<00:06:32.430> to<00:06:33.180> keep<00:06:33.360> your<00:06:33.510> battery<00:06:33.870> up

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and also you're going to need a motor

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.500 
and also you're going to need a motor
mount<00:06:36.950> and<00:06:37.950> this<00:06:38.520> is<00:06:38.700> really<00:06:39.210> simple

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
mount and this is really simple

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.420 
mount and this is really simple
basically<00:06:41.540> because<00:06:42.540> I'm<00:06:42.660> not<00:06:42.840> in<00:06:42.960> the<00:06:43.050> water

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
basically because I'm not in the water

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.380 
basically because I'm not in the water
this<00:06:44.430> will<00:06:44.580> be<00:06:44.640> on<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.850> back<00:06:45.000> of<00:06:45.150> your<00:06:45.210> boat

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
this will be on the back of your boat

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.210 
this will be on the back of your boat
and<00:06:45.630> all<00:06:45.840> you<00:06:45.930> have<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.200> do<00:06:46.320> and<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:46.950> motors

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
and all you have to do and the motors

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.680 
and all you have to do and the motors
really<00:06:47.460> like<00:06:47.640> I<00:06:47.820> mean<00:06:48.000> it<00:06:48.120> just<00:06:48.270> lists<00:06:48.660> just

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
really like I mean it just lists just

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.290 
really like I mean it just lists just
slides<00:06:49.050> right<00:06:49.200> on<00:06:49.470> like<00:06:49.650> this<00:06:49.860> and<00:06:50.070> it's<00:06:51.030> mount

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
slides right on like this and it's mount

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.340 
slides right on like this and it's mount
it<00:06:51.450> to<00:06:51.480> your<00:06:51.600> boat<00:06:51.840> it's<00:06:52.050> really<00:06:52.380> easy<00:06:52.590> and<00:06:53.160> I

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
it to your boat it's really easy and I

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.690 
it to your boat it's really easy and I
think<00:06:55.350> oh<00:06:55.470> yeah<00:06:55.650> well<00:06:56.010> let<00:06:56.220> me<00:06:56.310> just<00:06:56.490> show<00:06:56.640> you

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
think oh yeah well let me just show you

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.460 
think oh yeah well let me just show you
where<00:06:56.910> this<00:06:57.060> goes<00:06:57.330> so<00:06:57.600> follow<00:06:57.870> me<00:06:58.080> around<00:06:58.170> to

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
where this goes so follow me around to

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.690 
where this goes so follow me around to
the<00:06:58.560> back<00:06:58.710> of<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:58.920> boat<00:07:00.410> and<00:07:02.420> the<00:07:03.420> motor<00:07:03.630> mount

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
the back of the boat and the motor mount

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.770 
the back of the boat and the motor mount
basically<00:07:05.700> hooks<00:07:05.970> in<00:07:06.150> the<00:07:06.270> back<00:07:06.450> like<00:07:06.720> that

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
basically hooks in the back like that

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.290 
basically hooks in the back like that
and<00:07:07.260> then<00:07:07.980> you<00:07:08.340> can<00:07:08.490> just<00:07:08.670> slide<00:07:08.910> your<00:07:08.940> motor

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
and then you can just slide your motor

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.890 
and then you can just slide your motor
down<00:07:09.540> and<00:07:09.870> then<00:07:10.590> what<00:07:10.830> I<00:07:10.860> usually<00:07:10.950> do<00:07:11.750> with<00:07:12.750> the

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
down and then what I usually do with the

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
once again back over this way with this

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.610 
once again back over this way with this
battery<00:07:24.270> is<00:07:24.390> really<00:07:24.660> heavy<00:07:24.870> what<00:07:25.230> I<00:07:25.260> like<00:07:25.500> to
