night little space heater keeps it warm

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.330 
night little space heater keeps it warm
and<00:01:47.679> then<00:01:50.700> made<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> top<00:01:52.240> here<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:54.069> hinge

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
and then made the top here so the hinge

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.440 
and then made the top here so the hinge
is<00:01:54.520> open<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> when<00:01:56.709> it's<00:01:56.859> hot<00:01:57.490> outside<00:01:57.520> ER<00:01:58.029> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
is open so when it's hot outside ER and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.589 
is open so when it's hot outside ER and
I<00:01:58.990> can<00:01:59.619> just<00:01:59.649> prop<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.310> up<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:00.849> open<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.420> roof

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
I can just prop this up up open the roof

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.660 
I can just prop this up up open the roof
then<00:02:02.499> I<00:02:02.619> cut<00:02:02.859> a<00:02:02.889> vent<00:02:03.130> down<00:02:03.279> here<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.639> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
then I cut a vent down here on the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.489 
then I cut a vent down here on the
opposite<00:02:04.179> side<00:02:04.389> on<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.569> bottom<00:02:04.990> which<00:02:05.469> is

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
opposite side on the bottom which is

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.070 
opposite side on the bottom which is
typically<00:02:06.039> shaded<00:02:06.569> same<00:02:07.569> way<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:07.779> made<00:02:07.959> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
typically shaded same way I made the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.680 
typically shaded same way I made the
door<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.619> three-sided<00:02:09.369> slit<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.509> can

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
door just a three-sided slit so I can

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.780 
door just a three-sided slit so I can
prop<00:02:10.930> it<00:02:10.960> open<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.920> screen<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.340> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
prop it open with a screen on it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
prop it open with a screen on it
it'll<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.599> real<00:02:13.810> nice<00:02:13.989> draft<00:02:14.290> going

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
it'll get a real nice draft going

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.410 
it'll get a real nice draft going
