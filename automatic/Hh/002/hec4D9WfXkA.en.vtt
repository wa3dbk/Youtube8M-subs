00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.960
 Good day in this video wanted 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 would like to share information with you 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.750
 stimulate the seeds and achieve 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 almost one hundred percent similarity 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.000
 see that we need her 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 need natural honey 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 warm water and baked 7 on a platter and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 here is a tea strainer that we do 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.379
 here is one teaspoon of honey diluted in 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.379
 warm water 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.379
 here we dilute honey in warm water 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 pour a saucer and pour out here I will 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.909
 stimulate basil seeds 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 Here I came in Italy So I ordered 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:37.820
 specially yourself such basil seeds 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:40.820
 that's how they look and we'll be here i 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 literally 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.259
 and here in this water you are literally on 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.409
 half an hour we leave our seeds 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:05.600
 they during this time are fed by this 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.050
 the solution is such a proven method I 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.430
 I have n't used it yet, but everyone here 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.569
 jungle checks professionals literally 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 recently I was sold like this somewhere 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.370
 information and then so that the water goes well 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.920
 we will use this strainer 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.459
 for tea we are here 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.069
 water and all our seeds can 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.190
 will then, after such stimulation has 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 sprout 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:52.069
 and land all the success until soon 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:56.570
 meetings and here's a continuation video, see 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.590
 it's been half an hour already I think you saw 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:07.010
 what were these little seeds that's how 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.750
 they were already drinking water and now i am 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.450
 seeds along with this water 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:18.410
 I will put a post such polyethylene 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 plastic and not any other capacity i 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.150
 took a plastic bottle cut 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.810
 in half reinforced this whole thing in 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.180
 in toilet paper and now these are all 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.659
 seeds with water I will move 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.480
 here and in the process I will here this bottle 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:46.349
 put a plastic bag in short 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:56.400
 look further and here's how it turns out 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:04:00.750
 already in this bottle and now i just have it 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.290
 I was placed in a plastic bag and a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.409
 but there will be water will evaporate later 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.980
 there will be there will be a microclimate which 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:18.949
 very good effect on the seed germination 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:22.860
 and that's how it turned out already in this 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:27.900
 stump close it is necessary hermetic 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:32.580
 under the crush below and here we have such 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.990
 the picture is so very good 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.910
 effective method 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:44.039
 I use them is not the first like this 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.250
 that apply all success to the ambulance 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.250
 meeting
