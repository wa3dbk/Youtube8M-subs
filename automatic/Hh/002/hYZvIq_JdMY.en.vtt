the<00:01:02.929> head<00:01:03.109> and<00:01:03.409> what<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:03.949> do<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.489> crisscross

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
the body pins like this because I think

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.950 
the body pins like this because I think
it<00:01:08.300> lends<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:09.250> secure<00:01:10.250> hold<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.060> you'll<00:01:11.810> be

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
it lends a secure hold and you'll be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.710 
it lends a secure hold and you'll be
good<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.620> majority<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.220> day<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.390> just

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
good for the majority of the day so just

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.540 
good for the majority of the day so just
take<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.050> in<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.090> slide<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.120> like<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.470> then

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
take it in and slide it like so and then

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.120 
take it in and slide it like so and then
I'll<00:01:19.550> take<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.120> second<00:01:20.660> one<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.140> slide<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130

the<00:01:22.910> crisscross<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.900> like<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.260> had<00:01:24.560> mentioned

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the crisscross it like I had mentioned

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.800 
the crisscross it like I had mentioned
before<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.650> have<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.370> part<00:01:28.790> up<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.210> you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
before so you have this part up and you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.480 
before so you have this part up and you
could<00:01:29.960> adorn<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.940> flower<00:01:33.490> flowers

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
perhaps that will be at her wedding so

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.950 
perhaps that will be at her wedding so
you<00:01:37.490> could<00:01:37.760> get<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.940> fake<00:01:38.210> version<00:01:38.600> or<00:01:38.750> real
