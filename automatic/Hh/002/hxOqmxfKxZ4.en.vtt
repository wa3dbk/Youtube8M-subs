they<00:00:36.719> were<00:00:36.780> pulled<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> last<00:00:37.530> second<00:00:37.950> just

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
they were pulled at the last second just

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.160 
they were pulled at the last second just
because<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.820> weren't<00:00:39.030> quite<00:00:39.390> done<00:00:39.629> pulsing

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
because they weren't quite done pulsing

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.770 
because they weren't quite done pulsing
up<00:00:40.290> whenever<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> show<00:00:41.219> and

up whenever they are going to show and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
up whenever they are going to show and
you're<00:00:42.780> building<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.550> state-of-the-art

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you're building a state-of-the-art

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
you're building a state-of-the-art
engine<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.180> sources<00:00:45.480> confirm<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.050> state

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
engine my sources confirm to me a state

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
engine my sources confirm to me a state
of<00:00:46.410> our<00:00:46.559> engine<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.309> basically<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of our engine that's basically going to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.670 
of our engine that's basically going to
get<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.300> games<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.780> look<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.350> let's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
get you games that look as good as let's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.290 
get you games that look as good as let's
say<00:00:49.770> Killzone<00:00:50.340> 3<00:00:50.550> or<00:00:51.949> Gears<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> War<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
say Killzone 3 or Gears of War but the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.459 
say Killzone 3 or Gears of War but the
cool<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
cool thing about is that it's going to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.619 
cool thing about is that it's going to
be<00:00:55.530> running<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.860> 60<00:00:56.430> frames<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.820> second<00:00:57.210> instead

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
be running in 60 frames a second instead

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
be running in 60 frames a second instead
of<00:00:57.690> 30<00:00:58.050> frames<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.530> second<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
of 30 frames a second so you're going to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.689 
of 30 frames a second so you're going to
get<00:00:59.940> games<00:01:00.270> basically<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.550> as

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
get games basically that are just as

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
get games basically that are just as
good<00:01:03.239> looking<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.780> kill<00:01:04.049> zone<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.530> Gears<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
good looking as kill zone or Gears of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.200 
good looking as kill zone or Gears of
War<00:01:04.979> even<00:01:05.460> probably<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:06.030> better

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
War even probably a little bit better

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.469 
War even probably a little bit better
because<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.750> better<00:01:06.930> optimize<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.700> still

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
because we better optimize but still

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
because we better optimize but still
running<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.900> fast<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.650> expect<00:01:10.770> for

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
running as fast as you would expect for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789 
running as fast as you would expect for
Metroid<00:01:11.549> Prime<00:01:12.080> corruption<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> Wii<00:01:13.500> or
