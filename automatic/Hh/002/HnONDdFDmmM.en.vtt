00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.300
 to the body the balloons are pretty 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.030
 fragile 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.700
 you know they have to stay away 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.720
 of the sharp pecos we give to manners 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.720
 They must maintain 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.290
 This can weaken the rubber and cause 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
 its breaking however in this 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.870
 experiment is going to eat just like how 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.950
 can have a balloon near the flame 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.950
 without breaking it 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.320
 this experiment we need 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 several by forums or a lighter 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 and do 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.250
 we throw the 60 milliliters of water 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 second balloon 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.310
 that does not have water we proceed to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 come closer 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 next step we take the balloon that 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.939
 has water and 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.939
 good 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.960
 then the most he did was color 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.450
 black 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.540
 the flame coming out at what was approaching 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.220
 she the case of global without water it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.550
 it gets so hot that it gets too hot 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.400
 of how to withstand the pressure of 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.400
 air inside the balloon because the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.180
 balloon with a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.730
 with water does not break the water is a big 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.579
 Absorbent heat when the water 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.280
 half again it is placed over the flame 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.420
 absorb more heat from the fire than the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 rubber so the balloon rubber heats up 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.290
 -7 does not break
