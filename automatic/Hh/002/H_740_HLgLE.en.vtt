than<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.539> before<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.620> more<00:00:46.739> path

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
than the one before but it's more path

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
than the one before but it's more path
to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> under<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.610> sentry<00:00:47.940> horsepower<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to do under the sentry horsepower and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
to do under the sentry horsepower and
gives<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> bigger<00:00:49.320> ol<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> 1280

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

kilos anyway let's find out more about
it<00:00:52.410> from<00:00:52.440> Christian<00:00:53.250> juice<00:00:53.430> Agana<00:00:53.820> owns

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it from Christian juice Agana owns

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.600 
it from Christian juice Agana owns
diamond<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> Christian<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> engine<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
diamond so Christian the engine is a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
diamond so Christian the engine is a
little<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.000> heavier<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.570> modifications<00:00:57.960> if

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little bit heavier what modifications if

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
little bit heavier what modifications if
you<00:00:58.620> had<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> DA<00:00:59.789> 40<00:01:00.239> mg<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you had to make to the DA 40 mg it's the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
you had to make to the DA 40 mg it's the
biggest<00:01:01.530> project<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
biggest project first was the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390 
biggest project first was the
development<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> engine<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:05.010> has<00:01:05.220> now

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
development of the engine which has now

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.670 
development of the engine which has now
170<00:01:06.360> horsepower<00:01:07.070> fuelled<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.159> jet<00:01:08.700> a1<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
170 horsepower fuelled by jet a1 and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
170 horsepower fuelled by jet a1 and
because<00:01:10.680> his<00:01:10.890> engine<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.820> developed

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
because his engine which we developed

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
because his engine which we developed
was<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.720> heavier<00:01:13.290> than<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
was a little bit heavier than the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
was a little bit heavier than the
previous<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.670> had<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> redesign<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
previous one we had to redesign the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
previous one we had to redesign the
airplane<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
airplane and we had also to do all the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
airplane and we had also to do all the
testing<00:01:19.140> again<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.460> increase

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
testing again because we also increase

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.109 
testing again because we also increase
the<00:01:21.090> takeoff<00:01:21.450> weight<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:22.549> 1150<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.820> twelve

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the takeoff weight from 1150 to twelve

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
the takeoff weight from 1150 to twelve
hundred<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.540> eighty<00:01:24.720> kilograms<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
hundred and eighty kilograms so all this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.140 
hundred and eighty kilograms so all this
together

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
together

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
together
was<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.750> big<00:01:27.900> project<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.310> reason

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
was a very big project but the reason

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
was a very big project but the reason
why<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.000> did<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:31.020> sure<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.619> all

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
why we did it was to make sure that all

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.580 
why we did it was to make sure that all
our<00:01:32.040> customers<00:01:32.790> who<00:01:33.180> already<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.229> da

projects already the airplane will go

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.400 
projects already the airplane will go
from<00:02:36.780> 270<00:02:37.709> horsepower<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.819> third<00:02:39.000> version

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
from 270 horsepower and a third version

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.890 
from 270 horsepower and a third version
also<00:02:40.410> maybe<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:41.040> 380<00:02:41.820> horsepower<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.690> all

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
also maybe with 380 horsepower but all

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.979 
also maybe with 380 horsepower but all
on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.350> diesel<00:02:43.560> range<00:02:43.829> where<00:02:44.820> G<00:02:45.030> C<00:02:45.209> dominant<00:02:45.450> 5

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
on the diesel range where G C dominant 5

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.790 
on the diesel range where G C dominant 5
or<00:02:46.260> 10<00:02:46.440> years<00:02:46.470> time

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
or 10 years time

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.040 
or 10 years time
yeah<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> good<00:02:50.960> question<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:52.490> want<00:02:53.050> to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
yeah that is a good question we want to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.540 
yeah that is a good question we want to
stabilize<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.450> expand<00:02:56.450> at<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> same<00:02:57.110> time<00:02:57.550> so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
stabilize and expand at the same time so

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.340 
stabilize and expand at the same time so
at<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> moment<00:02:58.880> we<00:02:59.150> have<00:02:59.360> invested<00:02:59.870> heavily

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
at the moment we have invested heavily

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.800 
at the moment we have invested heavily
in<00:03:00.650> all<00:03:00.890> kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.190> new<00:03:01.340> projects<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.540> want<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
in all kind of new projects we want to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.020 
in all kind of new projects we want to
finish<00:03:03.110> these<00:03:03.290> ones<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.490> we<00:03:04.640> are<00:03:04.730> already

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
finish these ones but we are already

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.270 
finish these ones but we are already
working<00:03:05.270> on<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.990> so-called<00:03:06.350> future<00:03:06.800> small

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
working on the so-called future small

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.820 
working on the so-called future small
aircraft<00:03:07.760> which<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.630> an<00:03:08.750> aircraft<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.560> course

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
aircraft which is an aircraft of course

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.470 
aircraft which is an aircraft of course
with<00:03:09.980> diesel<00:03:10.190> engines<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.760> completely<00:03:11.300> new

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
with diesel engines a completely new

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.620 
with diesel engines a completely new

and of course long-range easy to

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.900 
and of course long-range easy to
maintain<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.050> program<00:03:21.590> might<00:03:22.160> come<00:03:22.700> on

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
maintain so this program might come on

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.350 
maintain so this program might come on
the<00:03:23.030> market<00:03:24.160> 2014-2015

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.860 
the market 2014-2015
it<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.640> comparison<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.150> projected

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
it is a comparison to this projected

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.650 
it is a comparison to this projected

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
aircraft that already exists is there so

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.309 
aircraft that already exists is there so
similar<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.260> da<00:03:33.410> 24<00:03:34.190> ago<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:34.959> imagine<00:03:35.959> the

then<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.680> are<00:03:40.770> getting<00:03:40.830> close<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.630> about

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
then we are getting close to it about

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.360 
then we are getting close to it about
