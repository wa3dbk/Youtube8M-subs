00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.410
 Hello friends with you now he is 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.480
 55th graduation master on all tanks 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.730
 heading in which I get a mark 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.890
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.930
 today we will talk again about the Soviet 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.529
 heavy tank this time the eighth 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.180
 level and it is called apt-4 it seems it's time 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 for some time to remove the Soviet 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.960
 tanks from voting because i have 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.879
 it seems that if 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.649
 There is a Soviet tank in question 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.989
 it is for him I have to do 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.519
 the video so this time among 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.069
 candidates for the next release 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.510
 Soviet technology will not be but a link 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.059
 to vote you as always can 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.479
 found in the description for this video and now 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.670
 let's move on to our coval 4 not 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.100
 so what can we say about the dynamics of this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.329
 heavy principle she is a very good tank 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.879
 quickly gaining its maximum 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.190
 speed of 30 kilometers per hour and can 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.510
 easily maintain it the truth is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.640
 certain speed problems 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.620
 reversing with us leaving only 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.380
 11 kilometers per hour so fast 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.360
 crawl away ask you fail me 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.250
 I really like these tanks because I 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.410
 very often uses the technique rolled out 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 shot and quickly rolled back at 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.030
 this without taking damage on anyone 4 to 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.920
 Unfortunately, this can not be done 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.870
 our duty is spinning very slowly 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.270
 so any medium and light tank 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.610
 easily you twist the truth they always 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.560
 will punch 4 because he has 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 very good booking on it 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.430
 Now let's talk 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.680
 first of all the tower is very good 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.860
 the sides are armored there 150 millimeters 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 and they need to tank if you 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.700
 correctly set and not you board 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680
 strikes even the most serious weapon but 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.950
 with the exception of probably podeshek 10 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.800
 level frontal booking for tanks 8 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.600
 level is also very good at 160 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.479
 top bar where the devices are located 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.520
 180 millimeter observations and exactly 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.950
 same booking 180 millimeters 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.650
 has a turret commander machine gun 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.750
 turret and gun mask when staging 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.189
 a tank in the forehead case often 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.290
 keeps kicks from sevens 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.990
 and most eights as long as 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.780
 they are not for 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 goes premium shells and if to 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 the tower is worth a diamond then its much easier 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.020
 punch her into the hull a in the tower in 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.390
 ground in the cheeks and in a small area 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 around the gun because there behind the mask 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.460
 no main armor 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.710
 as for tanks 9 and 10 level they 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.140
 Our heavy in the forehead punch with virtually no 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.810
 problems so if there is a possibility of them 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.460
 best to tank overboard 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 I also want to mention two more 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.270
 moment of the first this randomness 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.520
 commander machine gun turret here 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.890
 for example when I shoot him more often 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.290
 just hear ricochet or no penetration 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.510
 at the same time when he rode on someone 4 then 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.240
 Most of the time she was bombarded with shells 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.280
 damage and the second point is fuel 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.290
 tanks which are located in our tank 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.230
 in the front of the hull along the sides 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.940
 because of these fuel tanks to the tower is very 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.580
 It often burns and not only when 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.130
 piercing a large-caliber gun 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.860
 can also set fire through the right roller and 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.870
 if punches in nld and vld closer to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.730
 right track in this case the projectile 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.490
 flies inside the tank to the fuel 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.590
 tanks and can cause a fire therefore 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.990
 I highly recommend them to carry a fire extinguisher 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.680
 before the spider I somehow tried to ride with 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.990
 doppike 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.200
 and you know what, then he somehow puts out a bad 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.510
 fire and now a few words about the gun 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.310
 Honestly, I expected a little of him 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.430
 no more breaking through of course 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.630
 good 227 millimeters in a mouse this 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.940
 enough to punch 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.050
 and nine and tens according to zones 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.970
 I'll keep silence 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.270
 even more break through and accordingly 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.090
 problems less one-time damage 320 units 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.400
 they are standard for Soviet tyazhy 390 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.050
 but it is at least compensated a little better 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.530
 rate of fire compared to the same 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.050
 IS-3 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.090
 but that's what I was not particularly pleased 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.680
 in this gun this is a very long time 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.170
 data almost three and a half seconds 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.990
 which is again characteristic of the same 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.110
 is off I somehow thought that if alpha 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.060
 not 392 information should be less than three 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.580
 seconds but no here came out small 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.140
 bummer pleases at least what is accurate 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.490
 guns normally spread over 100 meters 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.890
 038 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.910
 vertical alignment angles in principle 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.920
 normal 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.500
 but for me personally these six degrees down 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.560
 and 12 degrees up were not very 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.900
 comfortable on this with characteristics 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.060
 finish and let's figure out how to get 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.390
 masters on our Soviet gravity 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.370
 for this you need to earn about 1200 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.640
 net experience bar is not so high 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.800
 so make it easy being 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.480
 top of the list must go to 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.060
 direction where usually meet 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.590
 heavy tanks and crush it well or defit 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.300
 depending on how much is there 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.470
 opponents 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.630
 understandably need to try 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.850
 damage tank and highlight 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.860
 for allies the truth is with the last y to 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.990
 the tower will have some problems because 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.880
 that the survey is only 350 meters and 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.790
 highlight it will turn out that 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.500
 near or middle distance and if 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.150
 you are in a fight with nines and 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.280
 dozens then everything is standard 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.110
 especially not to go ahead and help 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.360
 allies shooting from behind their backs 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.820
 never need don't forget to leave 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.410
 forward take damage and tank and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.570
 as I said in tank better 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.480
 just so less likely that you 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.280
 who punch 4 in the top with a small 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.410
 support allies can create 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.840
 incredible things and perform the most 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.360
 challenging personal combat missions for heavy 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.970
 tanks so play for someone fourth 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.580
 I wish you strong armor precise weapons and 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.740
 may the master be with you on this on 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.600
 today everyone thanks for your attention with 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.730
 you were now on subscribe to 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.710
 channel here's a fan and forget to look at 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.160
 my channel there is also a lot of different 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.060
 masters 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.060
 to new meetings
