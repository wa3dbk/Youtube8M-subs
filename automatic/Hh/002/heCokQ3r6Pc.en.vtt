 I 'm staying there 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.380
 Weight think Umama 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.069
 It is quite heavy compared to this 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.930
 It is my likely 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.769
 This is the power supply 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.920
 And now the tactical question really shines 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.690
 I think just because I so so good at are using another gold Tteyuu not from day 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.900

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.810
 3rd place 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.639
