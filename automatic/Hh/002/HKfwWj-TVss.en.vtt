here at triathlon experts com and what I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.319 
here at triathlon experts com and what I
mean<00:00:34.469> by<00:00:34.620> different<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.670> only<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.149> put

mean by different is not only do we put

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090 
mean by different is not only do we put
balance<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> every<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> our<00:00:37.829> meals

balance and every one of our meals
including<00:00:38.760> our<00:00:38.969> shake<00:00:39.329> recipe<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> have

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
including our shake recipe but we have

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.440 
including our shake recipe but we have
some<00:00:40.829> super<00:00:41.399> special<00:00:41.790> ingredients<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.360> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
some super special ingredients that I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
some super special ingredients that I
want<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> share<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.170> too<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:44.250> worry

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160 
want to share with you too don't worry
about<00:00:44.789> writing<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.360> down<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
about writing these down I'm going to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
about writing these down I'm going to
give<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> recipe<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.280> end<00:00:47.460> okay

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
give you the recipe at the very end okay

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.810 
give you the recipe at the very end okay
so<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> talk<00:00:49.530> about<00:00:49.559> balance<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.489> talking

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so when I talk about balance I'm talking

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
so when I talk about balance I'm talking
about<00:00:51.059> balancing<00:00:51.840> fats<00:00:52.289> proteins<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
about balancing fats proteins and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
about balancing fats proteins and
carbohydrates<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.969> each<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> every<00:00:54.600> meal<00:00:54.780> in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
carbohydrates at each and every meal in

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
carbohydrates at each and every meal in
the<00:00:55.170> shake<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.649> no<00:00:55.949> different<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.449> going

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the shake is no different so we're going

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
the shake is no different so we're going
to<00:00:57.660> start<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:58.140> protein<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> I<00:01:00.000> would

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to start with protein and I would

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
to start with protein and I would
recommend<00:01:00.719> cool<00:01:01.680> processed<00:01:02.430> whey<00:01:02.699> protein<00:01:03.270> or

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
recommend cool processed whey protein or

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.240 
recommend cool processed whey protein or
if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> dairy<00:01:04.379> problem<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.129> go

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
if you have a dairy problem you can go

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.270 
if you have a dairy problem you can go
with<00:01:05.430> rice<00:01:05.700> p<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> hemp<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:07.229> eat<00:01:07.500> soy<00:01:07.950> I'm

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
with rice p and hemp don't eat soy I'm

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700 
with rice p and hemp don't eat soy I'm
not<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.930> way<00:01:10.380> or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
not going to go into that now but way or

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
not going to go into that now but way or
rice<00:01:10.979> p<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.340> hemp<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:11.880> options<00:01:12.510> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rice p and hemp are my two options there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.050 
rice p and hemp are my two options there
we<00:01:13.140> already<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.670> plenty<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
we already know there's plenty of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
we already know there's plenty of
evidence<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.689> there<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.110> shows<00:01:16.439> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
evidence out there that shows that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.940 
evidence out there that shows that
whenever<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.670> add<00:01:17.939> protein<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:19.110> carbohydrate

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
whenever we add protein to carbohydrate

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
whenever we add protein to carbohydrate
that<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.520> actually<00:01:20.759> enhance<00:01:21.630> protein

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that we actually enhance protein

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
that we actually enhance protein
synthesis<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:23.159> sure<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.460> got

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
synthesis so we want to make sure we got

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
synthesis so we want to make sure we got
that<00:01:23.790> protein<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.390> shake<00:01:24.630> mix<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.350> next

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that protein in your shake mix the next

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
that protein in your shake mix the next
thing<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.549> add<00:01:26.850> your

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
thing we want to do is add your

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
thing we want to do is add your
carbohydrate<00:01:27.840> source<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> people

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
carbohydrate source now a lot of people

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
carbohydrate source now a lot of people
use<00:01:29.790> fruit<00:01:30.090> juice<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
use fruit juice not me I don't like it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590 
use fruit juice not me I don't like it
and<00:01:32.280> I'll<00:01:32.490> tell<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.000> don't<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and I'll tell you why I don't like it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.130 
and I'll tell you why I don't like it
it's<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.619> high<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.920> sugar<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's because it's high in sugar and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's because it's high in sugar and
unless<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> hard

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
unless you're going out for a hard

unless you're going out for a hard
training<00:01:38.310> effort<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:38.939> coming

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
training effort or you're just coming

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
training effort or you're just coming
back<00:01:39.540> from<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> don't<00:01:40.259> need<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
back from one you don't need all that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
back from one you don't need all that
sugar<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.610> we're<00:01:41.759> looking<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.810> meal

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
sugar what we're looking for in a meal

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.100 
sugar what we're looking for in a meal
is<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:44.060> slow-burning<00:01:45.060> long<00:01:45.509> lasting

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
is a slow-burning long lasting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.800 
is a slow-burning long lasting
carbohydrate<00:01:46.860> source<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.509> whole

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
carbohydrate source and that is whole

with<00:03:00.269> recovery<00:03:00.950> yeah<00:03:01.950> let's<00:03:02.549> use<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.790> too<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
with recovery yeah let's use it too and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.170 
with recovery yeah let's use it too and
so<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.200> say<00:03:04.860> put<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.580> scoop<00:03:05.790> or<00:03:05.910> two<00:03:05.970> of

so I say put in a scoop or two of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.150 
so I say put in a scoop or two of
l-glutamine<00:03:06.930> it's<00:03:07.110> also<00:03:07.260> great<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.739> protein

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
l-glutamine it's also great for protein

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.780 
l-glutamine it's also great for protein
synthesis<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.709> real<00:03:10.890> power<00:03:11.130> food<00:03:11.489> for

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
synthesis but it's a real power food for

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.809 
synthesis but it's a real power food for
bolstering<00:03:12.480> your<00:03:12.720> immune<00:03:12.989> system<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
speeding up recovery so throw that in

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.580 
speeding up recovery so throw that in
there<00:03:16.500> throw<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.000> packet<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.930> either

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
there throw in a packet of either

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.940 
there throw in a packet of either
emergency<00:03:20.489> or<00:03:20.730> ol<00:03:21.090> Aloha<00:03:21.570> Aloha<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.440> my<00:03:22.650> choice

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
emergency or ol Aloha Aloha is my choice

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.759 
emergency or ol Aloha Aloha is my choice
but<00:03:23.459> either<00:03:23.730> one<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.329> fine<00:03:24.590> basically<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.739> I

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
but either one is fine basically what I

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.610 
but either one is fine basically what I
like<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.310> those<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.450> vitamin<00:03:27.989> B's<00:03:28.230> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
cellular energy secondly a lot of times

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.210 
cellular energy secondly a lot of times
under<00:03:35.970> stress<00:03:36.420> our<00:03:36.870> bodies<00:03:37.560> whether<00:03:37.739> it's
