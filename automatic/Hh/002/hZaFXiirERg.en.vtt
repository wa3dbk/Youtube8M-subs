00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.669 

so<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.780> device<00:01:43.110> i<00:01:43.409> use

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
so what we have here is the device i use

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.370 
so what we have here is the device i use
to<00:01:44.009> convert<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> power<00:01:44.969> pads<00:01:45.240> signals<00:01:45.869> into

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to convert the power pads signals into

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.429 
to convert the power pads signals into
MIDI<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:48.929> what<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.979> read<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
MIDI so what I do is I read in the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.959 
MIDI so what I do is I read in the
Nintendo<00:01:52.439> controller<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:53.159> serially

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
Nintendo controller here serially

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.669 
Nintendo controller here serially
there's<00:01:54.179> two<00:01:54.360> lines<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.899> power<00:01:55.200> pad<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
there's two lines for the power pad and

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.740 
there's two lines for the power pad and
one<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.429> separate<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.090> controller

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one that's separate for the controller

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.010 
one that's separate for the controller
and<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.819> the<00:02:00.319> arduino<00:02:01.319> here<00:02:01.819> to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
and then i use the arduino here to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.179 
and then i use the arduino here to
convert<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> signals<00:02:04.619> read<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.039> way<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
convert the signals read the way to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.630 
convert the signals read the way to
convert<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.970> then<00:02:06.119> output<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
convert them and then output them to a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.199 
convert them and then output them to a
midi<00:02:08.640> jack<00:02:10.009> which<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.340> communicates<00:02:12.030> with

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
midi jack which then communicates with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.970 
midi jack which then communicates with
my<00:02:12.660> keyboard<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.140> generate<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> sounds

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
my keyboard to generate the sounds

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
my keyboard to generate the sounds
they're<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.519> hearing<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> real

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
they're that you're hearing so a real

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.960 
they're that you're hearing so a real
simple<00:02:16.349> project<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.099> post<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.640> code<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:17.940> line

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
simple project I post the code on line

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.539 
simple project I post the code on line
and<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.769> could<00:02:19.950> follow<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> directions

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
and so you could follow the directions

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.039 
and so you could follow the directions
in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> schematics<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.720> put<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:21.989> together

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
in the schematics and put it together

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.849 
in the schematics and put it together
for<00:02:22.410> yourself<00:02:22.680> alright<00:02:23.670> cool
