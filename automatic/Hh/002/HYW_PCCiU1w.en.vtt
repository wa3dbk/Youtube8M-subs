00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.420 
well she's a crown tail she could see on
the<00:02:25.870> tips<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.200> her<00:02:26.320> tail<00:02:26.530> they're<00:02:27.040> white<00:02:27.220> now

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the tips of her tail they're white now

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
the tips of her tail they're white now
but<00:02:28.150> when<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.270> first<00:02:28.330> got<00:02:28.630> her<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.990> was<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
but when I first got her it was like the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
but when I first got her it was like the
bullet<00:02:29.830> dark<00:02:30.010> blue<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:30.430> black<00:02:30.760> color<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
bullet dark blue or black color so I

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.570 
bullet dark blue or black color so I
think<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.380> she's<00:02:35.560> matured<00:02:36.070> or<00:02:36.220> grown<00:02:36.459> or

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
think I think she's matured or grown or

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.449 
think I think she's matured or grown or
whatever<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:39.600> there<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.620> tank<00:02:42.130> or<00:02:42.400> a

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
whatever and then there is a tank or a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
whatever and then there is a tank or a
point<00:02:42.700> right<00:02:42.820> there<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.810> lot<00:02:44.020> like<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
point right there it's a lot like a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.270 
point right there it's a lot like a
thicker<00:02:44.830> plant<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:47.770> pretty<00:02:48.040> sharp

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
thicker plant but this it's pretty sharp

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.790 
thicker plant but this it's pretty sharp
right<00:02:48.550> there<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:50.020> could<00:02:50.260> tear<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.620> mouse

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
right there so it could tear the mouse

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.270 
right there so it could tear the mouse
pins

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
pins

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.940 
pins
so<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.030> put<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.930> female<00:02:53.350> side<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.830> was

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
so I put it on the female side I was

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.610 
so I put it on the female side I was
thinking<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.700> would<00:02:55.300> tear<00:02:55.540> fins<00:02:55.780> cuz

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
thinking that would tear fins cuz

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.470 
thinking that would tear fins cuz
they're<00:02:56.770> shorter<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.430> there's<00:02:58.300> just<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
they're shorter and there's just a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.580 
they're shorter and there's just a
cocktail<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.290> was<00:02:59.560> thinking<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.220> went<00:03:00.370> tears

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
cocktail so I was thinking it went tears

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.990 
cocktail so I was thinking it went tears
and<00:03:02.590> then<00:03:02.800> head<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.430> rock<00:03:04.200> um<00:03:05.200> also<00:03:06.100> plant<00:03:06.640> just

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
and then head of rock um also plant just

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.790 
and then head of rock um also plant just
what's<00:03:07.180> know<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> eat<00:03:07.510> then<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.290> one<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.620> also
