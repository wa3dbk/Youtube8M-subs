00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
to come from behind against the Bulls

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900 
to come from behind against the Bulls
because<00:03:45.230> they<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.859> guys<00:03:46.069> step<00:03:46.400> up<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.730> make

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
shots late and the magic really didn't

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.860 
shots late and the magic really didn't
and<00:03:49.609> also<00:03:50.000> you're<00:03:50.150> talking<00:03:50.359> about<00:03:50.420> Dennis

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
Rodman even making shots that's a real

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.140
