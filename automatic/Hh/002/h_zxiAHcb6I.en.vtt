00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.549
 brand new video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 today we are on the tonto glass or a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.900
 intelligence test that you will try to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.549
 pray with the strangest pitfalls 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 that exist in the world ok 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.480
 let's leave immediately then we play alone 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 this is easy now 20 seconds well 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 a bear passes in front of a house by 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.800
 rectangular shape with all the data that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.800
 they look at the challenge of color is to the bone 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.809
 not all the data looking south 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 perfect polar red white and the first one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 she's gone 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 ok this is easy then you know the seconds 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
 22nd the twenty-fourth president 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.320
 of the united states they had the same 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270
 parents 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 however they were not brothers as it is 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.289
 possible 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.769
 they were half brothers it was grover cleveland 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.170
 they were foster children that fuck while 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 I read the time is up 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 ok ok so we have seconds then 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.750
 let's explain a hen must new 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.460
 right on the border between france and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 portugal on the wind comes from the north west 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.909
 to which side should fall again 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.680
 which fuck I know neither one 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.340
 the protocol will be a homework between 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.710
 their 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 spain is still a problem 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 perfect ok so throwing yourself at random yes 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.759
 learn a new proverb then 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.229
 this is much more than 50 seconds 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.040
 then in history to go to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.700
 fair 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.950
 I met 7 jugglers and a rough man 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.439
 each juggler had six cats each 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.170
 cat had 5 duplicates after he had 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.079
 four houses each house had three rats 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 every rappa vera two drivers and every more 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.159
 from which he had a wife 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 how many people went to the fair or cazz e 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.990
 then in the street 7 jugglers though if 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.739
 he says people may mean men 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.739
 but there are seven in all yesterday the trio 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.580
 yes more than 14 thousand I think it is impossible 8 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:27.340
 no because they are always one I can only 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:30.519
 that one but you give 16 then this is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.030
 easy only eight seconds good color 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:39.930
 described the green image that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 fucking his ass st ass but then 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 this is a little difficult 30 than i 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.660
 birthdays say sica and that has one 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.480
 average person how many birthdays 1 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.840
 is not that one already 12 birthdays in a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.060
 year that is how many times enasco oh well 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.720
 this was bullshit this is a bit 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.630
 hard 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.120
 ok a plane crashes on the border between 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.640
 Mongolia and China all passengers have 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.860
 lost their documents where it is 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 they bury the survivors 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.079
 then if a plane crashes 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.980
 that is why they should where to bury the 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.340
 survivors 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.390
 the survivors are alive, yes not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.010
 bury see ok right then ie 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.310
 if a little difficult three women go into 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.319
 fair on a sidewalk is only one 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.630
 he has a handsome one which of the three does not 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.359
 wets the women full up on a 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.870
 pavement is only one has a 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:44.139
 umbrella is the one and a half that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.790
 at the umbrella theoretically none of the 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.790
 three so I put it to anyone 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.239
 ok my reasoning had no 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.170
 sense however for ass we got it right 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.349
 so what did we do seven answers 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.329

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.400
 quite satisfied 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.409
 ok I would say that for today we have arrived 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.269
