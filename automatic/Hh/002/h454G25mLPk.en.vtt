we've got the 9.7 inch retina display of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.400 
we've got the 9.7 inch retina display of
the<00:00:20.820> ipad<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.080> we've<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the ipad here and then we've got the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
the ipad here and then we've got the
10.1<00:00:23.189> inch<00:00:23.340> display<00:00:23.760> from<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> sony<00:00:24.330> tablet

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
10.1 inch display from the sony tablet

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.960 
10.1 inch display from the sony tablet
that's<00:00:25.289> only<00:00:25.760> 1920<00:00:26.760> x<00:00:26.880> 1200<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> wuxga

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
that's only 1920 x 1200 this is wuxga

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.919 
that's only 1920 x 1200 this is wuxga
obviously<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> won't<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> better

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
obviously we won't have the better

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
obviously we won't have the better
resolution<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.920> sony<00:00:32.160> tablet<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
again there are some benefits this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
again there are some benefits this
tablet<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.399> find<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
phone calls with it aside from the fact

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
expandable storage here you don't on the
iPad<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> other

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
options for example II have a 5

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
options for example II have a 5
megapixel<00:01:00.030> camera<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> iPad<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.500> an

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
8 megapixel camera here and even though

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.640 
8 megapixel camera here and even though
it's<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.619> through

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's really hard to go through

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's really hard to go through
specifications<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> tell<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> example

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
specifications and tell you for example

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.840 
specifications and tell you for example
but<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> Snapdragon<00:01:07.830> 801<00:01:08.040> processor<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
but this Snapdragon 801 processor is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
but this Snapdragon 801 processor is
better<00:01:09.210> than<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> a7<00:01:10.170> 64-bit<00:01:10.260> chip<00:01:10.950> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
better than the a7 64-bit chip it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
better than the a7 64-bit chip it's
really<00:01:11.580> hard<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.030> compare<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.450> yet<00:01:12.750> because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really hard to compare that yet because

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
really hard to compare that yet because
the<00:01:13.110> ipad<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.130> taking<00:01:14.310> advantage

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the ipad is not really taking advantage

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
the ipad is not really taking advantage
of<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.030> feature<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.350> will

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
of that feature now one thing I will

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950 
of that feature now one thing I will
tell<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.610> submergible<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.659> water

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
tell you is this is submergible in water

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.100 
tell you is this is submergible in water
this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.159> ip55<00:01:20.880> IV<00:01:21.180> 58<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this is not this is ip55 IV 58 so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
this is not this is ip55 IV 58 so
certified<00:01:22.830> whereas<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> iPad<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.180> cannot

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
certified whereas on the iPad you cannot

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
certified whereas on the iPad you cannot
submerge<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.409> tablet<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.520> question<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
submerge the tablet so the question is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
submerge the tablet so the question is
what<00:01:27.390> exactly<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:28.140> best<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> android<00:01:29.610> iOS

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what exactly is best for you android iOS

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
what exactly is best for you android iOS
it<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.630> depends<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.409> I'll<00:01:31.560> tell<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it really depends on you I'll tell you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
it really depends on you I'll tell you
this<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> best<00:01:33.750> build

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this much this is one of the best build
