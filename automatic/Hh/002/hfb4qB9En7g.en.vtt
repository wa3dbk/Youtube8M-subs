there<00:00:49.620> were<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> lot<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> times<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> started

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there were a lot of times when I started

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.350 
there were a lot of times when I started
out<00:00:52.550> running<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.820> doing<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> running

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
out running when I was doing the running

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
out running when I was doing the running
raw<00:00:54.539> project<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> those<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.469> few<00:00:55.620> years

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
raw project in those first few years

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
raw project in those first few years
where<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.520> doubted<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.210> was

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
where I really doubted that I was

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.930 
where I really doubted that I was
getting<00:00:57.719> enough<00:00:57.930> protein<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.640> wasn't<00:00:59.640> sure

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
getting enough protein I wasn't sure

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
getting enough protein I wasn't sure
because<00:01:00.930> I've<00:01:01.230> been<00:01:01.469> part<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.949> cultural

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
because I've been part of that cultural

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.179 
because I've been part of that cultural
brainwashing<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.710> back<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.070> an

doubts were still there and they those
doubts<00:01:37.110> stayed<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> couple<00:01:37.890> years

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
doubts stayed there for a couple years

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
doubts stayed there for a couple years
it's<00:01:39.479> only<00:01:39.600> maybe<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> past<00:01:40.320> three<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:40.950> four

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it's only maybe the past three or four

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.889 
it's only maybe the past three or four
years<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.030> confident<00:01:42.659> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
years that I'm really confident with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.219 
years that I'm really confident with
this<00:01:43.560> diet<00:01:44.630> even<00:01:45.630> though<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> data

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
this diet even though I had the data

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
this diet even though I had the data
even<00:01:46.680> though<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> data<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.280> right<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
even though the data was right there I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.730 
even though the data was right there I
still<00:01:47.970> had<00:01:48.149> doubts<00:01:48.360> well<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> doesn't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
still had doubts well what if it doesn't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.200 
still had doubts well what if it doesn't
work<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:49.860> me<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:50.909> different

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
work for me what if I'm different

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.190 
work for me what if I'm different
somehow<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.210> about<00:01:54.390> overcoming

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
somehow so it's really about overcoming

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.190 
somehow so it's really about overcoming
your<00:01:55.350> own<00:01:56.030> cultural<00:01:57.030> brainwashing<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.960> then

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
your own cultural brainwashing and then

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.959 
your own cultural brainwashing and then
dealing<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:59.610> friends<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> family<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
any evidence to support it but it's this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.430 
any evidence to support it but it's this
like<00:02:56.350> cultural<00:02:56.920> virus<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.640> everybody<00:02:57.970> has

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
like cultural virus that everybody has

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520 
like cultural virus that everybody has
that<00:02:59.440> they're<00:02:59.680> eating<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.220> deficient<00:03:00.640> diet

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that they're eating the deficient diet

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.260 
that they're eating the deficient diet
but<00:03:02.530> clearly<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.400> vegans<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> raw

but clearly the vegans and the raw

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.060 
but clearly the vegans and the raw
foodist<00:03:04.720> those<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.410> people<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:05.950> are

foodist those are the people that are

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.120 
foodist those are the people that are
deficient<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.850> smokers<00:03:08.130> telling

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
deficient it's like smokers telling

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
people that they're deficient in oxygen

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.350 
people that they're deficient in oxygen
because<00:03:10.900> they're<00:03:11.050> breathing<00:03:11.200> clean<00:03:11.590> air<00:03:12.360> it's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
because they're breathing clean air it's

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.790 
because they're breathing clean air it's
like<00:03:13.390> how<00:03:13.600> could<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.840> get<00:03:13.960> enough<00:03:14.170> oxygen<00:03:14.350> and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
like how could you get enough oxygen and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.380 
like how could you get enough oxygen and
breathing<00:03:15.040> clean<00:03:15.280> air<00:03:15.460> you<00:03:15.700> need<00:03:15.880> cigarettes

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
breathing clean air you need cigarettes

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.370 
breathing clean air you need cigarettes
to<00:03:16.540> get<00:03:16.660> oxygen<00:03:18.630> kind<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.990> know<00:03:20.080> what's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
to get oxygen kind of you know what's

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.780 
to get oxygen kind of you know what's
going<00:03:20.590> on<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.130> know<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> get<00:03:21.550> all<00:03:21.580> these

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
going on you know you get all these

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.490 
going on you know you get all these
people<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.240> are<00:03:22.360> eating<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.630> horrible<00:03:23.290> diet

people that are eating a horrible diet
which<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.340> heavily<00:03:24.930> supplemented<00:03:25.930> they're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
which is heavily supplemented they're

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.960 
which is heavily supplemented they're
like<00:03:26.920> oh<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.070> can't<00:03:27.340> be<00:03:27.430> vegan<00:03:27.550> because<00:03:27.910> you

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
like oh you can't be vegan because you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.400 
like oh you can't be vegan because you
need<00:03:28.120> b12<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.080> shows<00:03:29.260> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
need b12 and that just shows the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.290 
need b12 and that just shows the
veganism<00:03:29.740> doesn't<00:03:30.130> work<00:03:30.280> well<00:03:31.120> that's

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
veganism doesn't work well that's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.550 
veganism doesn't work well that's
interesting<00:03:31.480> because<00:03:31.810> your<00:03:32.170> milk<00:03:32.380> has
