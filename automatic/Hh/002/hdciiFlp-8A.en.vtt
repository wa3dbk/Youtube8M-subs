00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.650
 gameplay is on advanced and warfare 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.940

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.760
 so went tonight to detroit go 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.620
 oppose 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 we are in the combes with 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.879
 hypnosis his little thresher the app 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.160
 tech which really starts 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.260
 gently aiming laser etc this is a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.390
 1.3815 year-round trekking gameplay 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.610
 domination this is really small gameplay 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.870
 g am I mean project a 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.369
 started here I invite you tonight 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 we have been hiding for a long time 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.140
 27 this is a little bit the ball 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.820
 akamusic is there frankly we see 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.800
 gameplay at the threshing machine more veiled 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.320
 rush well he felt he's in 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.789
 the more he is solo these creams 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.190
 frankly I just told you these 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.229
 creams so for this little world we 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.460
 cordon de liga I saw these times 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.450
 because here I was long 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 inactive on the snow 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.600
 there were a lot of videos and so on 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.630
 people who were complaining about the river 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.560
 so that's it so I do not have you hide 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.830
 I came a little bit my opinion 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.150
 above their winter this boost is less 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.229
 start of the tenacious that 's because 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.330
 I did not know at all I heard 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.560
 people talked about blues emanation 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.479
 erogenous people from the parties kill the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.820
 1/8 actually I actually see that's it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.920
 simply st stadium tube to see 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.540
 from big series against two to 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780
 willing players with one with a down 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.580
 level 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.320
 I do not see at all what is there 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.689
 disturbing guys do not see at all 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.170
 so the merit not he does not make 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.090
 bullshit 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 i he does not call an era that 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.770
 company 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.049
 here he has seen twice people this is 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.399
 what's the concern guys at iv online 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.340
 guys but wait you do not have 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.660
 at the al alem club dearly frankly a dnm 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.280
 nuclear at the same 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.470
 wait for the guys a minimum an app 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.560
 overwhelm him keep certeau in decerto 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.480
 without camping and in full rush or not your 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.379
 people of your exact level 15 master 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.629
 right it's impossible 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.060
 I say it's impossible because we 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.920
 to the most angry community on the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.160
 of all the fps it is the players call 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.269
 of 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.810
 so basically a day that one 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.819
 experienced you will come precisely to 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.620

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.880
 do everything I reassure you a gain I you 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.450
 reassure I 'm playing call of since very 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.340
 long time 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 I am almost I am I am almost 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.180
 at all the precise max or almost all 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.129
 the sofade 27 warfare collectives and I 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.170
 can you guys tell you that 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.519
 on all call of that's what so what 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.110
 happens it's a big series you 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.000
 will you do this all along the game 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.400
 toulon of the game and already to kill 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 so the sweet river if the game is not 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.680
 as if I pronounce badly there's nothing 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.480
 nasty guys frankly there is a 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.489
 naughty after there are people they have 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.380
 their point of view is people who are 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.209
 strong enough to be able to make big 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.700
 Gameplay against fat Jacques lostk 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.319
 for them anyway guys do not blame 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.970
 what they did in any case 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.560
 answer in any case I understand that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.640
 you're a little upset but be 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.460
 not still 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.930
 havard it's not like if the guy he 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.580
 boost what it's really 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.290
 a beautiful stars to propose the lot 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 because he has the pressure so just that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.459
 you can respect that so today 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.750
 finally the little return on the chain the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.970
 villette I'm sorry guys when 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.400
 I'm sorry me because you are 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.690
 guys from Cairo so rabies under the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.920
 clothes of the rally frankly I 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.410
 stunned because in fact they are you 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.400
 bring back a little bit of my story 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.690
 it was really a rage 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.160
 heart me you like to see me find 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.540
 like your life frankly I always 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.610
 wanted to be bogus but turns out that when 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.850
 I was in I got to the wrong 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.610
 moment 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.140
 that's why I'm giving back glh 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.030
 will have quite slipped 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.680
 I have not got it but 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 morning builders in front of my house at 20 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.340
 meal time but the guards frankly 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.380
 if it's a little hot and the weekend 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.760
 I do not have time at all 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.500
 frankly I can do you some 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.120
 nice little things back with all 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.980
 the commentators that these sails to the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.780
 rage it's the killer's family what and 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.430
 so here I apologize for the absence 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.720
 so for this little comment s wanted 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.340
 speak a little bit into the facts that 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.239
 I see every day that they who me 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.750
 passionate it's just our 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.670
 generation 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.620
 because he spoke to me precisely with 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.419
 be it my mother nails people 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.609
 and old-fashioned jeans 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.740
 I see that in fact more generations 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.700
 advance and more actually the guys we are 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.460
 with technology 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.770
 I tell you this is that I notice 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.570
 that video games that are the games 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.110
 videos whether it's the computer that this 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.290
 oneself 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.220
 all that is defied cars 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.150
 per month of all energies 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.070
 renewable etc. 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.990
 everything changes everything that our 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.060
 generation precisely it is the generation 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.710
 of development have not yet 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.510
 we grew up with everything that is 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.070
 IT etc. field while the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.919
 guy I talked about the mach of my 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.540
 aunts and here you are 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.940
 tata one has necessarily tents or 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.340
 uncles or family who do not know themselves 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.960
 serve just a computer or 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.250
 an example console twice I 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.570
 played with a house that guys he has 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.070
 the quarantine he can say it's 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.570
 actually it's funny 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.590
 that I see people colovic and with him 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.270
 because it was worth it was not going out to 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.979
 send the joysticks not even 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
 how to aim that it was there it was 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.300
 funny but as you go 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.380
 I realized that I am 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.330
 really realized that our 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.490
 generation makes one is a trick will have to 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.020
 we are a little feigned but here we go 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.460
 I am the example themselves we have a little 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.990
 lazybones 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.470
 here we are we are less and less 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.940
 work but that does not prevent the 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.530
 technology it advances we can do 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.900
 nice stuff with and that's a trick 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.300
 really that I like to see that the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.310
 Generation is a lot of information at 10 years 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.289
 putting a little too much but otherwise it's okay 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.240
 really pleases me and to come back 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.020
 little bit of that I see you're up and down 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.330
 measured 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.130
 if you've noticed TV or at all 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.660
 case the computer all stream 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.000
 all the videos offline 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.220
 youtube the platforms and the twitch 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.600
 the acronyms and gamer connection and so on 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.450
 all really all these platforms and 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.520
 of beemotion are that little by little the 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.590
 telly she's starting to get some 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.950
 tired of TV I saw people 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.870
 downright who actually looks at but the 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.730
 string and all offline videos 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.010
 it's slowly starting to replace the 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.210
 telly so me already I notice here it is 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.920
 are there TV there is a program that me 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.730
 please do not fight and what am I 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.170
 me bar what am I going to do I 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.820
 sense my computer go on my 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.040
 computer I have the choice is seen as a 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.840
 choice that makes you favor 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.770
 automatically 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.860
 exactly everything that happens in stream 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.730
 and on the internet on TV is good I 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.169
 launches a small debate it's in the 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.480
 comments I would like to have necessarily 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.880
 your opinion strongly rather so 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.710
 are you for or against the stream or the 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.690
 does that just videos on 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.940
 internet replaces just the tale 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.470
 more visuals that's the question of 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.540
 ends so here I leave you on this 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.070
 Very very beautiful gameplay of both 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.660
 hypnosis do not hesitate to click its 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.890
 chain if you liked this comment 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.480
 do not hesitate on you leave you 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.680
 felt in the comments that will make 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.290
 pleasure in any case the return
