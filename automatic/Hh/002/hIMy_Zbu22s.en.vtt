00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.869
 title is how to win a lot of 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.930
 bells 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.670
 so I'm in the company of patches 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.240
 so yes to win a lot of 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.480
 bells 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.070
 you have to be two because there is 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.690
 several techniques yes it's catching 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.760
 insects on the heavenly by 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.220

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.629
 like that it refers not to bad because 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.790
 the end of the video I will show you 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.870
 some pictures because I do not want 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.610
 to go capture insects it's for 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.899
 that I have already taken pears for 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.809
 go sell them at russie so yes 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.340
 why sell them at a friend's house and well 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.079
 because when we sell them in his 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 city â€‹â€‹and for the perfect free it costs 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.440
 than 500 bell 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.199

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.190
 worth 3000 bell the fruit so yes 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.190
 it's enormous 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.340
 so as you want to found behind 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.640
 this is the castle so the castle the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.159
 jelly pay back a week after the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.740
 video that I did simply 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.810
 thanks to this technique of having full 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.130
 finally to have the fruits and touffah at 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.600
 early i was doing that with insects 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.010
 and then I realized that 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
 I wanted finally I wanted to leave the 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.189
 russia city i wanted to sell some 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.990
 fruits and finally new pear 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.729
 perfect like when I had on me 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.830
 and then georgia counts 3 me and I 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.689
 I'm told it's huge the price I have 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.680
 looked at one and it cost 3 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.720
 that's why I'm doing this 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.720
 now so I'll see family 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.950
 so it's super practical finally it's 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.040
 not that these kits and we'll say that's 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 finally what is simple what is it a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.100
 kind of bonus if you want it's great 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.750
 practice there since me 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.830
 I'm just telling you how I won 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.080
 more than 200000 cloche 288 clutch is 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.250
 so there I am not how much I earn 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.770
 because age and that charges before 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.150
 the end I may finally be playing between 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.140
 inventory like that when I'm going 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.970
 pass the time because that's 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 really so we end up after the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.840
 pause and has all chic 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.070
 so here you go walk faster 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:05.540
 Come on we swallowed the family 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:23.990

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:25.730
 here or there milan here go 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.110
 let's move on I do not want this video 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:38.300
 lasts an eternity that's why it 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:42.260
 is going to be right on that so go on then I 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.060

00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:02.980
 tortuous attention downtown we did 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.349
 not much this time it's already 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.680
