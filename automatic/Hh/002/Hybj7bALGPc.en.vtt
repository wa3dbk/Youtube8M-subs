stack here on our card base okay so it's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.290 
stack here on our card base okay so it's
just<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.230> matter<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.100> picking<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.790> the

color tones that you want and I've got
the<00:00:58.469> four<00:00:58.710> different<00:00:58.890> patterns<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.059> all

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
the four different patterns and so all

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.549 
the four different patterns and so all
of<00:01:00.840> mine<00:01:01.050> will<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:02.210> no<00:01:03.210> variegated<00:01:04.110> look<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of mine will have no variegated look and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.379 
of mine will have no variegated look and
then<00:01:04.680> I'll<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.979> repeat<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.460> pattern<00:01:08.389> I

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389 
then I'll just repeat that pattern I

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.739 
then I'll just repeat that pattern I
might<00:01:10.139> not<00:01:10.289> have<00:01:10.939> something<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.149> that'll

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:12.749 
might not have something then that'll

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.889 
might not have something then that'll
look<00:01:12.899> like<00:01:12.959> this<00:01:13.469> when<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.729> stacked<00:01:15.659> up

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
look like this when it's all stacked up

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.559

this<00:02:53.720> video<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.290> taking<00:02:54.709> me<00:02:55.150> even<00:02:56.150> though<00:02:56.270> it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
this video is taking me even though it's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.840 
this video is taking me even though it's
going<00:02:57.290> pretty<00:02:57.709> fast<00:02:58.010> probably<00:02:58.370> as<00:02:58.640> you're

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
going pretty fast probably as you're

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.720 
going pretty fast probably as you're
watching<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.420> just<00:03:00.290> having<00:03:01.280> one<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.580> those

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
watching it just having one of those

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.020 
watching it just having one of those
nights<00:03:02.030> where<00:03:02.470> lots<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.670> interruptions<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
nights where lots of interruptions so it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.850 
nights where lots of interruptions so it
seems<00:03:05.270> like<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.630> projects<00:03:06.260> taken<00:03:06.620> forever

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
seems like this projects taken forever

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.760 
seems like this projects taken forever
but<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.520> just<00:03:07.730> because<00:03:07.970> I'm<00:03:08.810> having<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.350> stop

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
but it's just because I'm having to stop

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.680 
but it's just because I'm having to stop
and<00:03:09.800> go<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.370> bit<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.270> that's

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
and go a little bit but I think that's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.960 
and go a little bit but I think that's
crafting<00:03:12.380> when<00:03:12.800> you're<00:03:12.980> around<00:03:13.130> other<00:03:13.430> people

crafting when you're around other people

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.670 
crafting when you're around other people
isn't<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.420> when<00:03:14.570> you've<00:03:14.720> got<00:03:14.900> families<00:03:15.440> and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
at 2 and 2 and 3/4 by 2 and 1/4 and then

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
at 2 and 2 and 3/4 by 2 and 1/4 and then
I<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:15.890> put<00:04:16.670> it<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.970> some<00:04:17.650> soft<00:04:18.650> suede<00:04:18.950> Brown

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.610

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
and then just slightly trimmed around

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.500 
and then just slightly trimmed around
cut<00:04:22.250> around<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.820> don't<00:04:23.030> even<00:04:23.120> have<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
cut around it so I don't even have the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.020 
cut around it so I don't even have the
exact<00:04:23.840> dimensions<00:04:24.410> for<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.740> brown<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.250> again<00:04:26.000> I

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
exact dimensions for the brown I again I

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.220 
exact dimensions for the brown I again I
trimmed<00:04:26.480> around<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.190> designer<00:04:28.520> paper

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
trimmed around that the designer paper

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.990 
trimmed around that the designer paper
measurements<00:04:31.120> it's<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.330> snail<00:04:32.750> on<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.820> is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
measurements it's a snail on it this is

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:49.050 
measurements it's a snail on it this is
going<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.300> be<00:04:35.420> our<00:04:35.630> top<00:04:35.990> section<00:04:36.890> here<00:04:45.670> I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.540 

probably<00:04:50.060> would<00:04:50.390> decorate<00:04:50.920> these<00:04:51.920> components

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
probably would decorate these components

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.760 
probably would decorate these components
before<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.910> put<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.300> pocket<00:04:53.510> on<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:53.930> put<00:04:54.560> the

before I put the pocket on it put the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.880 
before I put the pocket on it put the
layers<00:04:55.640> on<00:04:55.970> shore<00:04:56.600> hand<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.230> I<00:04:57.440> thought<00:04:57.860> I

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
layers on shore hand that I thought I

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.640 
layers on shore hand that I thought I
just<00:04:58.010> would<00:04:58.430> we<00:04:59.030> create<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.570> pocket<00:04:59.810> on

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
just would we create the pocket on

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.640 
just would we create the pocket on
section<00:05:01.280> first<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:02.390> then<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.810> bottom<00:05:03.080> strip

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
here this is 3 by 2 and 3/4 and again

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.020 
here this is 3 by 2 and 3/4 and again
just<00:05:07.670> trimmed<00:05:08.150> out<00:05:08.450> with<00:05:09.170> early<00:05:09.730> or<00:05:10.730> soft
