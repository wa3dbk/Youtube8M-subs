and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.960> effects<00:02:08.709> some<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.950> them<00:02:09.070> are<00:02:09.220> pretty

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
and the effects some of them are pretty

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.070 
and the effects some of them are pretty
bad<00:02:09.640> especially<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.209> fire<00:02:10.450> when<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:11.050> a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
bad especially to fire when you have a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.900 
bad especially to fire when you have a
game<00:02:11.320> about<00:02:11.500> hell<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.490> got<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> work

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
game about hell you really got to work

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.150 
game about hell you really got to work
on<00:02:13.060> fire<00:02:13.360> here<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> fire<00:02:14.110> looked<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.980> was

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
on fire here the fire looked like it was

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.940 
on fire here the fire looked like it was
cardboard<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.350> that's<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.800> main

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
cardboard and that's really my main

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.160 
cardboard and that's really my main
complaints<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> graphics<00:02:19.090> oh<00:02:19.330> yeah<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
complaints on the graphics oh yeah and I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.780 
complaints on the graphics oh yeah and I
agree<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.739> guess<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.100> shows<00:02:21.340> its<00:02:21.610> age

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
agree and I guess that shows its age

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.250 
agree and I guess that shows its age
being<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.510> an<00:02:22.630> older<00:02:22.780> game<00:02:23.020> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
being that it is an older game and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.560 
being that it is an older game and
basically<00:02:23.560> ported<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.250> did<00:02:24.820> really<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.209> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
basically ported I did really like the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.720 
basically ported I did really like the
environments<00:02:26.260> though<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:27.070> also<00:02:27.340> really

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.150 
environments though and I also really
liked<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.120> beginning<00:02:28.650> level<00:02:29.650> where<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.040> was

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
liked the beginning level where it was

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.620 
liked the beginning level where it was
kind<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> snow<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.239> kind<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.480> gave

kind of like in the snow it kind of gave
me<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.840> resonable<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.560> vibe<00:02:32.830> in<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.700> way<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
way they they they voice match to their

way they they they voice match to their
voice<00:02:45.910> everything<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.570> combined<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.240 

this<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.850> third-person<00:03:00.450> shooter<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.530> what

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
this is a third-person shooter so what

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.890 
this is a third-person shooter so what
you're<00:03:02.400> watching<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.850> what<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.270> this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
you're watching is what you get this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.080 
you're watching is what you get this
isn't<00:03:04.230> resonable<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:05.010> though<00:03:05.220> or<00:03:05.520> at<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> game

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
isn't resonable for though or at a game

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.020 
isn't resonable for though or at a game
like<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.560> feels<00:03:08.160> clunky<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.910> my

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
like that it is a it feels clunky in my

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.940 
like that it is a it feels clunky in my
opinion<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.570> shooting<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.140> basically<00:03:10.920> just

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
opinion the shooting is basically just

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.970 
opinion the shooting is basically just
shoot<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:11.940> just<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.390> main<00:03:12.570> gameplay<00:03:12.980> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
shoot that's just the main gameplay it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
shoot that's just the main gameplay it
doesn't<00:03:14.370> work<00:03:14.520> particularly<00:03:15.390> well<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.110> feel

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
doesn't work particularly well I feel

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
doesn't work particularly well I feel
like<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.980> aiming<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.490> off<00:03:17.790> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.510> like

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
like the aiming is off kind of like

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.290 
like the aiming is off kind of like
turning<00:03:19.080> point<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.620> way<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.030> guess

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
turning point in a way and I guess

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.090 
turning point in a way and I guess
that's<00:03:21.510> due<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.990> stiff<00:03:22.230> animation<00:03:22.770> also

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
that's due to the stiff animation also

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.680 
that's due to the stiff animation also
feel<00:03:23.340> when<00:03:23.610> you're<00:03:23.730> aiming<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.210> just<00:03:24.390> goes<00:03:24.540> out

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
feel when you're aiming it just goes out

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.260 
feel when you're aiming it just goes out
of<00:03:24.750> control<00:03:24.870> at<00:03:25.350> times<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.190> uh<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.240> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
of control at times but uh what I what I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.570 
of control at times but uh what I what I
did<00:03:27.540> kind<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.100> kill<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> guy

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
did kind of like is when you kill a guy

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.120 
did kind of like is when you kill a guy
you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.330> pick<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.630> his<00:03:30.690> soul<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.410> my<00:03:31.560> drain<00:03:31.950> it

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you can pick up his soul and my drain it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.590 
you can pick up his soul and my drain it
and<00:03:32.250> you'll<00:03:32.490> get<00:03:32.640> health<00:03:32.910> back<00:03:33.120> from<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and you'll get health back from that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.860 
and you'll get health back from that
yeah<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.470> unfortunately<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:36.510> pick<00:03:36.690> up

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
yeah but unfortunately to pick up

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.560 
yeah but unfortunately to pick up
bullets<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.800> do<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.040> same<00:03:38.310> thing<00:03:38.790> so

bullets not have to suck their soul get
bullets<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.580> doesn't<00:03:59.760> make<00:04:00.030> any<00:04:00.090> sense

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
bullets it just doesn't make any sense

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.680 
bullets it just doesn't make any sense
and<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.250> leads<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.580> very<00:04:02.730> many<00:04:02.970> frustrating

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
and it leads to very many frustrating

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.030 
and it leads to very many frustrating
parts<00:04:03.989> where<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.230> jump<00:04:04.440> out<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:04.890> you're

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
parts where you jump out then you're

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.350 
parts where you jump out then you're

trying to get bolts and you get killed

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.500 
trying to get bolts and you get killed
in<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.660> process<00:04:07.220> also<00:04:08.220> there's<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
in the process also there's the the the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.330 
in the process also there's the the the
powers<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.050> game<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.800> could<00:04:10.830> have

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
powers in the game and it could have

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.770 
powers in the game and it could have
been<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.610> neat<00:04:11.910> probably<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> most

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
been really neat probably the most

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.120 
been really neat probably the most
useful<00:04:13.019> one<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.440> one<00:04:13.590> where<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:13.830> kind<00:04:14.010> of

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
useful one is one where you can kind of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.190 
useful one is one where you can kind of
supercharge<00:04:14.880> your<00:04:14.970> bullets<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.630> it's<00:04:16.019> kind

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
supercharge your bullets and it's kind

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.960 
supercharge your bullets and it's kind
of<00:04:16.229> your<00:04:16.350> shooting<00:04:16.650> flame<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:17.220> your<00:04:17.400> with

of your shooting flame with your with
your<00:04:18.000> bullets<00:04:18.540> but<00:04:19.250> still<00:04:20.250> aside<00:04:20.609> from<00:04:20.729> that

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
your bullets but still aside from that

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.400 
your bullets but still aside from that
there's<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.299> where<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.540> like<00:04:21.720> teleport

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
there's one where you can like teleport

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.990 
there's one where you can like teleport
for<00:04:22.590> puzzles<00:04:22.979> you're<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.250> teleport<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> can

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
for puzzles you're like teleport you can

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.690 
for puzzles you're like teleport you can
turn<00:04:24.600> around<00:04:24.750> quickly<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.500> like<00:04:25.680> access<00:04:26.669> a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
turn around quickly and like access a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.430 
turn around quickly and like access a
control<00:04:27.150> panel<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.780> then<00:04:27.930> it'll<00:04:28.080> warp<00:04:28.320> your

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
control panel and then it'll warp your

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.260 
control panel and then it'll warp your
back<00:04:28.590> or<00:04:28.800> click<00:04:28.979> but<00:04:29.190> it's<00:04:29.669> kind<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.030> clunky

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
back or click but it's kind of clunky

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.790 
back or click but it's kind of clunky
because<00:04:30.750> wherever<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.080> warp<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.620> doesn't

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
because wherever you warp to it doesn't

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.680 
because wherever you warp to it doesn't
it<00:04:31.979> warps<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.400> facing<00:04:32.640> away<00:04:32.940> from<00:04:33.150> what

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
it warps you facing away from what

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.750 
it warps you facing away from what
you're<00:04:33.720> looking<00:04:34.169> at<00:04:34.290> also<00:04:35.010> annoying<00:04:35.310> as<00:04:35.550> hell

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
you're looking at also annoying as hell

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.850 
you're looking at also annoying as hell
yeah<00:04:36.240> also<00:04:36.600> kind<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.900> just<00:04:37.050> mention<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.530> it's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
yeah also kind of just mention that it's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.680 
yeah also kind of just mention that it's
not<00:04:38.010> really<00:04:38.310> teleporting<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.330> more<00:04:39.630> like

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
not really teleporting it's more like

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.780 
not really teleporting it's more like
making<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.530> double<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.130> yourself<00:04:41.520> because

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
making a double of yourself because

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.460 
making a double of yourself because
you're<00:04:41.970> not<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:42.540> there<00:04:42.720> forever<00:04:43.200> you're

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
you're not going there forever you're

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.590 
you're not going there forever you're
just<00:04:43.650> kind<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:43.979> putting<00:04:44.250> yourself<00:04:45.210> there<00:04:45.390> for

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
just kind of putting yourself there for

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.180 
just kind of putting yourself there for
a<00:04:45.630> second<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.260> then<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.500> teleport<00:04:47.040> back

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
a second and then you teleport back

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.020 
a second and then you teleport back
that's<00:04:47.460> kind<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:47.910> retarded<00:04:48.120> if<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.760> uh

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that's kind of retarded if I is and uh

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.900 
that's kind of retarded if I is and uh
and<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:52.020> then<00:04:52.260> meanwhile<00:04:52.650> there's<00:04:53.520> also<00:04:53.700> when

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
and and then meanwhile there's also when

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.310 
and and then meanwhile there's also when
we<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.180> like<00:04:54.300> take<00:04:54.630> an<00:04:54.750> item<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.169> can

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
we can like take an item you can

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.600 
we can like take an item you can
teleport<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.160> get<00:04:56.310> kind<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.520> like

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
teleport it and you get kind of like

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.580 
teleport it and you get kind of like
this<00:04:56.760> visual<00:04:57.150> look<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.510> like<00:04:58.110> if<00:04:58.229> you<00:04:58.290> pick<00:04:58.440> up

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
this visual look of like if you pick up

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
this visual look of like if you pick up
a<00:04:58.680> box<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.130> can<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> or<00:04:59.850> of<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.390> box

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
a box you can get like a or of the box

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.850 
a box you can get like a or of the box
and<00:05:00.900> then<00:05:00.990> if<00:05:01.080> wherever<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.380> put<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.680> or

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
and then if wherever you put that or

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.980 
and then if wherever you put that or
that<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.280> instantly<00:05:02.910> warp<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.510> then<00:05:03.840> use

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
that you instantly warp it and then use

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.240 
that you instantly warp it and then use
that<00:05:04.020> for<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.410> few<00:05:04.530> parts<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.890> had<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.039> climb

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
that for a few parts you had to climb

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.730 
that for a few parts you had to climb
over<00:05:05.310> things<00:05:05.820> but<00:05:06.030> all<00:05:06.870> in<00:05:07.110> all<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.410> powers

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
over things but all in all the powers

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.140 
over things but all in all the powers
just<00:05:07.919> weren't<00:05:08.070> use<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.520> often<00:05:08.760> or<00:05:09.030> for

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
just weren't use that often or for

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.070 
just weren't use that often or for
anything<00:05:09.330> good<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.810> there

anything good and there

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.260 
anything good and there
not<00:05:10.259> that<00:05:10.500> great<00:05:10.919> also<00:05:11.639> in<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.879> gameplay

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
not that great also in the gameplay

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.820 
not that great also in the gameplay
there's<00:05:12.479> just<00:05:12.659> very<00:05:12.689> typical<00:05:13.349> things<00:05:13.620> like

there might be a ladder or something up
above<00:05:16.319> you<00:05:16.500> just<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.770> shoot<00:05:16.919> a<00:05:17.009> lock<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.280> bring
