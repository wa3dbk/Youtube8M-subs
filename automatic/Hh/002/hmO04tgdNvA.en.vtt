you<00:02:03.359> throw<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.719> kick<00:02:04.109> okay<00:02:05.039> so<00:02:05.609> right<00:02:05.819> now<00:02:05.849> we

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you throw the kick okay so right now we

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.300 
you throw the kick okay so right now we
can<00:02:06.419> focus<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.989> the<00:02:07.289> strengths<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310

midsection the muscles that flex towards
the<00:02:11.069> kick<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.300> part<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the kick that's just one part of the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.360 
the kick that's just one part of the
equation<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.560> focus<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.160> right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
equation if we can focus on that right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.160

midsection flexing the body sideways or
lateral<00:03:13.410> flexion<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.340> from<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.880> you're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
lateral flexion so from here you're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.250 
lateral flexion so from here you're
bring<00:03:15.930> both<00:03:16.140> legs<00:03:16.170> up<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.120> down<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.140> not

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
bring both legs up and down this is not

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.380 
bring both legs up and down this is not
to<00:03:19.319> say<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.739> your<00:03:20.069> abductors<00:03:20.819> or<00:03:21.239> your

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
to say that your abductors or your

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.570 
to say that your abductors or your
adductors<00:03:21.569> are<00:03:22.110> not<00:03:22.230> working<00:03:22.470> they<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.950> but

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
adductors are not working they up but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.160 
adductors are not working they up but
you<00:03:23.700> also<00:03:23.880> work<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> midsection<00:03:24.840> okay<00:03:27.170> if

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
you also work in the midsection okay if

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.349 
you also work in the midsection okay if
you<00:03:28.320> can<00:03:28.620> looks<00:03:28.859> upper<00:03:29.190> body<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.150> better

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
you can looks upper body this is better

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.340 
you can looks upper body this is better
option<00:03:31.790> then<00:03:32.790> demonstrate<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.510> now<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> here

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
option then demonstrate it now so here

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:49.410 
option then demonstrate it now so here
I'm<00:03:37.620> using<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:39.030> hold<00:03:39.209> my<00:03:39.420> legs<00:03:39.660> down

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.050 

it<00:03:49.990> is<00:03:50.260> better<00:03:50.500> carry<00:03:50.950> over<00:03:51.190> into<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.730> actual

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
it is better carry over into the actual

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.020 
it is better carry over into the actual
kick<00:03:53.250> once<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.520> worked<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
kick once you have worked in the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.760 
kick once you have worked in the
exercise<00:03:55.330> its<00:03:55.720> lying<00:03:55.959> down<00:03:56.200> on<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.470> side<00:03:56.739> of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
exercise its lying down on the side of

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.130 
exercise its lying down on the side of
the<00:03:56.980> body<00:03:57.160> now<00:03:57.940> we<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.270> actually<00:03:58.420> take<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> real

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
the body now we can actually take a real

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.960 
the body now we can actually take a real
exercise<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.980> carry<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.370> over<00:04:00.489> into<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
exercise and carry it over into the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.140 
exercise and carry it over into the
actual<00:04:01.330> kick<00:04:01.599> okay<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:03.099> basic<00:04:03.520> exercise<00:04:03.910> is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
actual kick okay the basic exercise is

line and then you laterally flex in it

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.219 
line and then you laterally flex in it
okay<00:04:20.010> if<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.340> too<00:04:21.549> easy<00:04:21.579> for<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.540> do
