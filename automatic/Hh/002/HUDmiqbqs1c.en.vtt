00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.640
 Y 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.650
 hi sallars and welcome today we are 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.510
 the Huawei stand we are going to make a 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.510
 presentation of 6 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.119
 here we have the unpresentable now 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.669
 same barcelona I'm fine 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.439
 saying and that those 36 or what is it 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.149
 we want to transmit with the 36 good 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.099
 really what we want is to continue 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.899
 with the history of astepe 6 the year 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.000
 past we present until you start with a 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.430
 historic phone for us in what 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.640
 that manufacturing by design themes and 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.559
 materials used were finished 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.300
 metallic a pretty iconic design 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.120
 but because that essence we want 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.399
 keep up the c6 we'll see it 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.469
 some surprise like connectivity and 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.020
 all this as we have gotten it from 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.450
 device a price very much 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.680
 that's the goal of doing it like that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.060
 way when we are left with a 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
 phone 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.920
 that keeps in the same design lines the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.580
 curved lower part is the same as the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.750
 of the 36 the metallic finishes are 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.660
 both national for a toboggan touch 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.970
 or 4 5 inch screen is believed to be HD 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.130
 how are we teaching terminal a 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.940
 quad-core processor is a young 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.500
 from ram 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.510
 8 gigas of expandable memory through 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.890
 microsd but mainly the phone 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.810
 is based on two interesting aspects 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.570
 a a proposal of cameras that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.000
 maintains the same line as this one 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.520
 on rear cameras with a sensor 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.830
 high quality only 8 megapixels and the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.830
 5 megapixel front camera 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 came to the other differentiating element is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 in a new media of which we are 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.680
 talking about price incorporate the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680
 connectivity 4g category 4 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:55.080
 seconds and that's a little bit 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.100
 differentiating elements of the team more 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.100
 beyond that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.340
 incorporates a new stage of Huawei 2.0 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.649
 and what advantages or characteristics 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.909
 mainly the political layers 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.530
 previous are the previous versions 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.060
 of the center layer of the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.900
 customization now we're going to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 focus on a control right now we're going 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.860
 to be able to follow 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.569
 and here we have it eating a manager of the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.099
 device can use the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.530
 team performance can optimize 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.260
 the battery and also some 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.390
 characteristics like us of the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.730
 permits that are also those of 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 permissions or access control 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.980
 they find remains predications by a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:49.240
 battery of 25 results adding 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.400
 energy details 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.610
 we use taking advantage of knowledge 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.380
 to use the algorithms that 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.510
 we talked and we implemented them in 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.319
 our devices that optimize the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.200
 standby time 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.910
 it's how it is 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.250
 for example one of them is called power 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.420
 controls and what it does is feed the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.420
 computer transmission circuit 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:20.370
 that is to say that I am still alive but on 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.370
 that guy get ahead of that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.910
 of time 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 so with a 2000 battery we're going to 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.090
 can use it 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 the house on the back cover was if that was not 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.760
 it comes like this not because the new 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.860
 you exchange but because there is a 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.660
 accessory that is the housing is your remover 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.120
 and you put the case so that it does not bully you 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.120
 more and it's a housing that covers everything 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.340
 here I leave you away that will be available 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.629
 in May around about 249 euros 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.629
 to the person kids
