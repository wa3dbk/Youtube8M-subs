 almost all with vocal control 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 they allow a disabled person not only 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:32.550
 to live better but to be certain 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:38.310
 even self-sufficient video cases

 an accident in the car are originating 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.500
 of a mountain village in the province of

 verbania and I was rehabilitated here 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.180
 in the hospital morelli di sondalo by nine 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.010
 years and a half ago they didn't exist 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 yet 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.560
 we say ideas all this did not exist 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.259
 as a story the usefulness of an apartment 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.110
 of the kind only imaginable if not yes 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.460
 just try to imagine why you don't 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.350
 even maybe he can believe that 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.330
 may be such a thing 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.130
 the usefulness of having everything 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.220
 electronic however controlled 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.520
 locally thanks this device 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.040
 here and have the opportunity to be able to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.190
 manage the house independently 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.000
 without the help of any person who 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.830
 do assistance too or that anyway 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.490
 he always had the fixed presence of 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.170
 some of them all serve for 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.600
 make even more free to make people feel 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.289
 a person better because he feels 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.289
 independent 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.770
 the initiative started two years ago 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.190
 easy home as it's called is a project 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.860
 European a very important project that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.560
 It has allowed us to see a house 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.560
 completely computerized I dare say 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 alien but given you when the computer 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.800
 fails to manage all functions 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 which are useful for a disabled person 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.420
 this lift system was 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 invented invented has been tried 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.250
 so as to allow thanks to gods 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 rails that are placed on the roof on 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.120
 ceiling of the house 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.640
 here these tracks can be 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.690
 arranged throughout the entire house and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.220
 let's be investigated once 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.680
 harnessed with the lift system 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.420
 you can reach all corners 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.160
 of the house where it clearly was 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 prepared track 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.610
 experimentation during this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.560
 week made these felt 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.810
 subjects generally freer more 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.690
 autonomous and made even the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 assistants of these freer subjects 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:18.190
 and and less workloads to give 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.190
 assistance to the patient himself fast 2 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.190
 switched on 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.430
 the usefulness of a house with modified 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.239
 so is that also to take knowledge 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.130
 of how he is actually at home until 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.680
 we are in the wards there are nurses there 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.959
 they are the engineers there is always assisted 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.940
 there are no problems, even the family member 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.970
 the department assist, but there isn't 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.360
 worker must go to heart anyway not 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.799
 may you know how you became 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.170
 actually then the utility of 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.780
 this is the possibility of being able to star 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.700
 inside with the person they then live 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.670
 bad that you will still be a family member 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.959
 or at least just to see with 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.610
 friends 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.530
 anyway to see oneself as one is 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.380
 actually out we have 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.840
 worked on a prototype and I'd say i 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.419
 Grandma prototypes can not have a 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.190
 precise economic reference we say 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.260
 that with the walls included with the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.690
 constructions including cost cost a 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.930
 we 400 million is not that we should 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.880
 clone 100 square meters of home yes 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.910
 clone only the environments of 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.090
 interest is only the telematic part 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.310
 which is the real novelty of this house the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 cost could be indicatively 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:52.229
 from 20 to 25 million 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.229
 the word lowers
