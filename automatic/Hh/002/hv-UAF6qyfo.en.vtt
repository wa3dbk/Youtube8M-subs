Penny's<00:01:11.640> neighborhood<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.409> what

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
Penny's neighborhood up down to what

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.320 
Penny's neighborhood up down to what
precedes<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.350> ghetto<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.460> the

precedes as the ghetto and I think the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
precedes as the ghetto and I think the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
culture in the media so a lot of what

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
culture in the media so a lot of what
people<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.930> what's<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
different from the people who lived here

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.270 
different from the people who lived here
their<00:01:27.720> perspective<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.530 

I<00:02:14.980> mean<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.040> guess<00:02:16.189> I'm<00:02:16.310> used<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.090> diversity

I mean I guess I'm used to the diversity

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.539 
I mean I guess I'm used to the diversity
so<00:02:17.930> if<00:02:18.290> I'm<00:02:18.650> looking<00:02:18.769> at<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.040> picture<00:02:19.280> alkyl

oh well it's a very diverse looking
picture<00:02:21.499> I<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:21.889> think<00:02:22.010> oh<00:02:22.159> that's<00:02:22.280> some
