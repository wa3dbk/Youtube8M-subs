00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:11.809
 so hello to everyone in this video I tell you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.179
 I will tell you how to mine clay minecraft 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.039
 See there is a campaign lava source so 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.949
 for clay mining you first 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.369
 need water find any place where 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 there is up to preferably such a swamp 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 similar to this and more to you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 need a boat so do a boat so 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.390
 wood is not enough for me 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 oak boards 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 many of you probably know best 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.489
 immediately make a couple of boats because 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 usually and rather on the boat and break easily and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.620
 you can be right on the water i 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.649
 traveled before this village and gathered up 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.590
 all goodies do not pay attention 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.680
 they are not needed for the extraction of clay and so 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.859
 we go to extract clay clay always 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.000
 practically under water she 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.900
 has specificity 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 oh guys see here she see this one 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.700
 substance though not along the way they yes yes yes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 here she is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.100
 take a shovel and and get mined 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 usually shovel and start clay usually 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 it takes quite a lot so here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 greed does not hurt need to collect all 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 that is, so now I'll show you how it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.869
 it looks like clay bokeh if their 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.960
 you break it here is clay 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.579
 these are the pieces 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.390
 they need a lot of clay used 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.670
 for mainly for brick production 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 so let's have some more clay, let's see 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 denim everything so look at the water she 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.840
 must be distinguished see here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.920
 clearly show this is the land of the year 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.810
 black schA I tear from the boat 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 look vodka do not swim away 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.160
 here it is sand than even his people here 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 this land and this is black so dark 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.510
 stone-like this clay 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.390
 here we begin to extract it from clay 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.780
 It turns out beautiful bricks 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.510
 more precisely brick blocks how do I do 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 I will show in the next lesson so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.410
 let 's see my he is there too 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.410
 a piece of clay to put your boat 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.640
 yes yes yes here, too, along the wedge 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.160
 cut off the boat and get some clay 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.160
 for the next lesson until the next video 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 then were mined mined 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:04.840
 Soon we drown out the boat in winter so 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.840
 my work bench I think he broke the boat there 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:17.130
 so nishtyak but when all clay I you 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:20.620
 showed here I got 64 and 45 clay 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.220
 so now admire and very easy 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.830
 to mine 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.500
 but the problem is that its usually 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.950
 a lot and need a lot more necessary 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.890
 to mine 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.690
 so everybody thanks for watching everyone bye 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.850
