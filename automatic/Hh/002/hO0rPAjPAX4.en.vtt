00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
that's just a real letter they rarely

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.990 
that's just a real letter they rarely
attack<00:05:02.810> groups<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.710> people<00:05:03.889> but<00:05:04.669> if<00:05:04.819> you're

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
attack groups of people but if you're

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.649 
attack groups of people but if you're

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
alone

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:15.159 
alone
watch<00:05:05.990> us<00:05:13.180> look<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.360> still<00:05:14.690> waiting<00:05:14.930> for<00:05:14.960> some

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
watch us look in still waiting for some

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.839 
watch us look in still waiting for some
action<00:05:15.500> looks<00:05:15.680> really<00:05:15.830> trippy<00:05:16.159> in<00:05:16.220> here<00:05:16.400> in

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
action looks really trippy in here in

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.249 
action looks really trippy in here in
about<00:05:16.970> thirty<00:05:17.300> thirty-one<00:05:17.780> frames<00:05:18.050> per

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
about thirty thirty-one frames per

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.210 
about thirty thirty-one frames per
second<00:05:18.620> inside<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:19.009> here

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
second inside of here

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.379 
second inside of here
seems<00:05:22.220> like<00:05:22.370> frames<00:05:22.639> per<00:05:22.789> second<00:05:23.030> would<00:05:23.150> slow

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
seems like frames per second would slow

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.939 
seems like frames per second would slow
down<00:05:23.419> up<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.780> get<00:05:23.870> multiple<00:05:24.349> objects<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:24.889> the
