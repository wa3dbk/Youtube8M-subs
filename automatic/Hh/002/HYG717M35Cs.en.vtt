most beautiful purple flowers so you

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.270 
most beautiful purple flowers so you

think liberally across the surface of
the<00:00:53.739> soil<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.250> then<00:00:54.429> lightly<00:00:54.789> just<00:00:55.149> tease<00:00:55.359> the

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
the soil and then lightly just tease the

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.479 
the soil and then lightly just tease the
soil<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.109> just<00:00:56.379> sits<00:00:56.649> on<00:00:56.859> top<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.250> seed

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
soil so it just sits on top of the seed

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.279 
soil so it just sits on top of the seed
give<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.300> water<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.750> that's<00:00:58.870> all<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.170> have

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
give it a water and that's all you have

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.069 
give it a water and that's all you have
to<00:00:59.410> do<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.829> cannot<00:01:00.429> fail<00:01:00.820> with<00:01:01.329> this<00:01:01.510> blonde

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
to do you cannot fail with this blonde

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.569 
to do you cannot fail with this blonde
there's<00:01:02.440> no<00:01:02.589> way<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.890> won't<00:01:03.219> get<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.489> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
important thing to think about is also

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.280 
important thing to think about is also
it's<00:02:22.549> not<00:02:22.819> just<00:02:22.879> bees<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.959> want<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.260> your
