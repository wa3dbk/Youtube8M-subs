00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.519
 hello today in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 explain how to draw a fish from a 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.890
 Very fast and simple way 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.430
 we would start by drawing an eye 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.430
 here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.780
 doing it 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.090
 this part inside 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.710
 and now we would go to make it the way 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.590
 body 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.590
 it would be something like that the smile 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.809
 would come here and here there would be a fin 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.809
 we wanted so 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.840
 and so and drawing him some lines between 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.530
 socks 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.170
 and around here another suitcase 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.110
 to continue we would in fact leave the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.710
 eyes that there would be another here and we would give 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 same 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.280
 leaving a small white dot inside the eye 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.939
 then to continue we would do here this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.939
 part to finish 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.210
 and this one that would come here 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.490
 here we will draw the tail that would be 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.490
 A) Yes 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.000
 we ate and we make it like two others 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.480
 fins of these 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.760
 here 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.180
 and another one here and we would give it to him 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.200
 A) Yes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 and so 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.659
 and we would lack the flap of the back 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:01.990
 and make some flakes we had rented 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 and a few scales for being like that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.240
 and so and we would have a fish drawn 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.040
 in a very fast and very simple way 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.620
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.620
 and we would see each other in my next video
