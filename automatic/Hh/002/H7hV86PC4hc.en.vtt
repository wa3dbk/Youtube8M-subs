we<00:00:09.480> decided<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.050> really<00:00:10.230> exciting

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
we decided to the really exciting

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.870 
we decided to the really exciting
subject<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.160> brings<00:00:11.309> together<00:00:11.490> maths

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
subject that brings together maths

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.200 
subject that brings together maths
physics<00:00:12.269> engineering<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.259> even<00:00:13.349> psychology

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
physics engineering and even psychology

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.320 
physics engineering and even psychology
normally<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.929> 15<00:00:16.859> lectures<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.760> week<00:00:17.820> ish

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
normally about 15 lectures a week ish

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.560 
normally about 15 lectures a week ish
and<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:19.320> 1<00:00:19.949> supervision<00:00:20.609> per<00:00:20.970> module<00:00:21.390> every

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and about 1 supervision per module every

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.620 
and about 1 supervision per module every
week<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.109> two<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> five

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
week or two so you can have up to five

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900 
week or two so you can have up to five
sufficiently<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:26.099> start<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.550> broadly<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sufficiently we start very broadly a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.009 
sufficiently we start very broadly a
little<00:00:27.150> unusual<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.930> actually

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
little unusual in that we actually

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870 
little unusual in that we actually
encourage<00:00:28.590> students<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.279> another<00:00:29.609> subject

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
encourage students to do another subject

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.519 
encourage students to do another subject
outside<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> computer<00:00:30.929> science<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.349> their

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
outside of computer science in their

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.319 
outside of computer science in their
first<00:00:31.740> year<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.790> spend<00:00:33.059> half

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
first year so they actually spend half

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.970 
first year so they actually spend half
of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> year<00:00:33.870> doing<00:00:34.110> computer<00:00:34.440> science<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
of the year doing computer science a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
of the year doing computer science a
quarter<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> year<00:00:35.880> doing<00:00:36.149> mathematics

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
quarter of the year doing mathematics

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
quarter of the year doing mathematics
and<00:00:36.989> usually<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> quarter<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> adding

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and usually a quarter of the adding

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
and usually a quarter of the adding
something<00:00:38.489> else<00:00:38.700> such<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.239> physics

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 

so<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> Cambridge<00:00:44.850> course<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so the Cambridge course is one of the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119 
so the Cambridge course is one of the
best<00:00:45.780> regarded<00:00:46.230> computer<00:00:46.559> science<00:00:46.860> courses

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
best regarded computer science courses

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.979 
best regarded computer science courses
in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> world<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.180> stems<00:00:48.420> from<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.780> course

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
in the world and it stems from a course

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
in the world and it stems from a course
in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> 1950s<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:50.699> computer

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
in the 1950s it was the first computer

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
in the 1950s it was the first computer
science<00:00:51.059> course<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> world<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.290> really

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
science course in the world I really

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.549 
science course in the world I really
like<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> supervision<00:00:53.850> system<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:55.260> going

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like the supervision system just going

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
like the supervision system just going
by<00:00:55.739> lectures<00:00:56.339> there<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.059> always<00:00:57.210> things

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
by lectures there are always things

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
by lectures there are always things

things<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> talk<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> supervision

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
things to talk about and a supervision

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
fighting over our graduates so I'd like

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
if possible to stay and do the master's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
if possible to stay and do the master's
program<00:01:56.910> but<00:01:57.600> eventually<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.740> thinking<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
program but eventually I'm thinking of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
program but eventually I'm thinking of
