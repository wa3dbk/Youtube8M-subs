00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.609 
main thing we see from these two is that
we<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.159> also<00:02:05.869> connectors<00:02:06.869> although<00:02:07.409> they

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
we do have also connectors although they

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.950 
we do have also connectors although they
are<00:02:07.770> different<00:02:08.179> that's<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.450> even<00:02:09.720> though

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
are different that's right even though

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.880 
are different that's right even though
these<00:02:10.110> almost<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.039> identical<00:02:11.940> chargers<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
these almost have identical chargers the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.250 
these almost have identical chargers the
gear<00:02:14.190> live<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.000> middle<00:02:15.300> whereas<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
gear live is in the middle whereas the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
gear live is in the middle whereas the
gear<00:02:16.560> 2<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.280> side

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
gear 2 is on the side

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
gear 2 is on the side
this<00:02:18.540> did<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.780> need<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> occur<00:02:19.650> whatsoever

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
this did not need to occur whatsoever

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.640 
this did not need to occur whatsoever
but<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.090> made<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.660> Samsung<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.290> make<00:02:22.410> two

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
but this made it so Samsung can make two

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
but this made it so Samsung can make two
separate<00:02:23.040> chargers<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.060> would<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.300> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
separate chargers that you would have to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.490 
separate chargers that you would have to
buy<00:02:24.600> separately<00:02:25.760> Thank<00:02:26.760> You<00:02:26.970> Samsung<00:02:27.500> but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
that is going to be the main design

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.790 
that is going to be the main design
choices<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.640> differentiate<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:33.630> two<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
choices that differentiate these two so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.250 
choices that differentiate these two so
