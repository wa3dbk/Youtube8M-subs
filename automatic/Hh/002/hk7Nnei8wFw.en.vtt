00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.819 
into this so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.399> basically<00:00:33.030> dig<00:00:33.809> down<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.350> blocks

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
do is basically dig down by two blocks

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.979 
do is basically dig down by two blocks
right<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.750> want

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
right here as you can see then you want

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
right here as you can see then you want
to<00:00:37.200> dig<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.710> block<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to dig a block right there because you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.290 
to dig a block right there because you
want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> put<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.809> dispenser<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
want to put a dispenser right here and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.700 
want to put a dispenser right here and
inside<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> dispenser<00:00:43.079> you're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
inside of the dispenser you're going to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.799 
inside of the dispenser you're going to
want<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> put<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.280> fire<00:00:44.670> charge<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.600> go

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
want to put a fire charge there we go

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.119 
want to put a fire charge there we go
and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and then I'm just going to get out of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
and then I'm just going to get out of
here<00:00:47.280> by<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.579> digging<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.719> as

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
here by just digging out right here as

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
here by just digging out right here as
you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> next<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you can see and then the next thing you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840 
you can see and then the next thing you
need<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.660> basically<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.980> place<00:00:53.670> some

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
need to do is basically just place some

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
need to do is basically just place some
rails<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.360> right<00:00:54.570> here<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:55.800> some

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
rails down right here and then put some

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
rails down right here and then put some
dirt<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.210> you're<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
dirt around it because you're going to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
dirt around it because you're going to
need<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> push<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.649> minecart<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.609> TNT

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
need to push the minecart with TNT

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.930 
need to push the minecart with TNT
inside<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> hole<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
inside of the hole right here and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.359 
inside of the hole right here and
basically<00:01:03.809> once<00:01:04.110> you've<00:01:04.260> done<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.189> can

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
basically once you've done that you can

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.969 
basically once you've done that you can
then<00:01:05.610> remove<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.390> dirt<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> then

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
then remove the dirt right here and then

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
then remove the dirt right here and then
just<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.369> rid<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> rails<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.229> as

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
just get rid of the rails right here as

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
just get rid of the rails right here as
you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.060> basically<00:01:12.270> just

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you can see and then you basically just

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.410 
you can see and then you basically just
cover<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> hopefully<00:01:14.420> eventually

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
cover this up and hopefully eventually

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
cover this up and hopefully eventually
the<00:01:15.780> dirt<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.770> turn<00:01:17.009> into<00:01:17.159> grass<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the dirt will turn into grass so it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
the dirt will turn into grass so it
won't<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.450> obvious<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.229> there's<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> trap

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
won't be obvious that there's a trap

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
won't be obvious that there's a trap
here<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> basically<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.330> place

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
here and then you basically just place

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
here and then you basically just place
the<00:01:22.380> pressure<00:01:22.680> plate<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> can

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the pressure plate right here as you can

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.660 
the pressure plate right here as you can
see<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.659> someone<00:01:24.990> walks<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
see and if someone walks over to it and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
see and if someone walks over to it and
sees<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> chest<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> diamonds<00:01:28.409> inside

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
sees there's a chest of diamonds inside

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
sees there's a chest of diamonds inside
a<00:01:28.740> bit<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.670> some<00:01:29.880> diamonds

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
a bit right here you know some diamonds

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
a bit right here you know some diamonds
inside<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> chest<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.590> person<00:01:32.040> should<00:01:32.640> walk

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
inside of a chest the person should walk

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
inside of a chest the person should walk
over<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> pressure<00:01:33.450> plate<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
over the pressure plate if you make it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.170 
over the pressure plate if you make it
you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.250> less<00:01:35.970> obvious

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you know a little bit less obvious

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
you know a little bit less obvious
that's<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> trap<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> could<00:01:37.619> kind<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that's a trap you know you could kind of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
that's a trap you know you could kind of
design<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.329> obvious<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
design it so it's not obvious that it's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.819 
design it so it's not obvious that it's
going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> trap<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.530> yeah<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
going to be a trap but yeah you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
going to be a trap but yeah you
basically<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.460> walk<00:01:41.610> over<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> pressure

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
basically just walk over the pressure

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359 
basically just walk over the pressure
plate<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.259> should<00:01:43.500> explode<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
plate and then it should explode and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.600 
plate and then it should explode and
hopefully<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:46.079> will<00:01:46.200> kill<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> basically

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
hopefully it will kill you and basically

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.630 
hopefully it will kill you and basically
it's<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.750> mine<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.770> landmine<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's just kind of a mine a landmine and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's just kind of a mine a landmine and
you<00:01:50.970> could<00:01:51.119> probably<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:51.780> lava<00:01:51.990> under

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you could probably put some lava under

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
you could probably put some lava under
here<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> person<00:01:53.729> just

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
here or something so the person just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.389 
here or something so the person just
falls<00:01:54.030> into<00:01:54.240> lava<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.950> yeah<00:01:55.950> that'd<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
falls into lava and yeah that'd be a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
falls into lava and yeah that'd be a
pretty<00:01:56.610> awesome<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
pretty awesome thing to do but this is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.760 
pretty awesome thing to do but this is
basically<00:01:58.350> how<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.030> working

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
basically how you make a working

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
basically how you make a working
