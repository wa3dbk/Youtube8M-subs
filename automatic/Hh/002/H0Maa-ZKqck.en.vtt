00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello and welcome to the premiere 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.230
 brigitte's writing capsule 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.139
 today we are going to address a topic 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.170
 really topical and I named them 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.440
 sidewalks 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.560
 allard let's see together how 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.170
 use this tool that you find 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.279
 often in your notebooks to help 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.369
 write well so let's look at the screen the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.699
 sidewalk the other you it's the part 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.180
 central which is currently highlighted 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.940
 in yellow to recognize it 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.559
 you will see that it is bordered by two 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.540
 continuous lines straight lines 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.720
 so the sidewalk is the place the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.070
 safer to walk then 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.879
 when you walked had shared with me 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.549
 normally you walk on the sidewalk 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.549
 now on each side of the sidewalk 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:05.479
 sees lines that one a man's 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:09.430
 dotted lines and that represents the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.940
 street arts there are some down and up 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:17.840
 so in the street it's the cars 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.600
 who are walking 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.990
 except that sometimes it happens that some 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.969
 letters are formed in the sidewalk 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.479
 but outdated go out in the street at the top 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.539
 or down 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.020
 so let's see together how 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:40.909
 behave the letters because if I 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.840
 trace there you see that there train to 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.710
 inside the sidewalk a little trick 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.499
 to remind you of this kind of letter 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.600
 they are said to be letters 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:57.079
 ladybug because they are good 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 wise and she still remains in the 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.670
 sidewalk now look at the letter 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.730
 which is written to the naughty she goes out 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.720
 in the street 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:14.590
 she goes in water here is the tea so this 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 type of letter 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.170
 we will name them the letters 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.710
 giraffes because they have a long stroke and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:30.060
 she world and go out in the street duo 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.310
 finally let's look at the last letter 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.300
 who she always starts in the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.460
 sidewalk but oh 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.780
 the naughty she goes out on the street then 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.750
 this type of letter 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 we will call it the monkey letters 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.710
 because of the great that comes out at the bottom 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 sidewalk in the street we have them 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.200
 ladybugs the giraffe letters and the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.630
 letters seats 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.270
 let's see now how 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.910
 divide the alphabet according to the type of 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.830
 letter 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.280
 then we will find them our roof 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.250
 relay to renounce in yellow so that you 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.900
 see where they are 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.530
 arte sees itself appear a small 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.530
 car to remind you that this is the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.050
 street where there is a dotted line and that 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.560
 sometimes naughty letters come out of the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.120
 pavement 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.150
 they will go for a walk in the street 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.520
 allard what are the letters ladybug 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.520
 here they have the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:59.250
 the cee the i the m 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:05.010
 n the top 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.010
 the r le 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.430
 the u 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.820
 v 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.090
 w the x and z 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.130
 now the giraffe letters these are 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:38.630
 the letters coming out in the street from 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:38.630
 up we got up we got the d 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.200
 h 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.820
 the case 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.930
 the l 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.280
 tea 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.040

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.800
 naughty shots coming out on the street 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.800

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.590
 the y 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:43.010
 here is our monkey here is something for 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.620
 to write better you can incline your notebook 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.220
 located right handed tulle incline 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.400

 wise ladybug letters and giraffes 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.860
 and we saw how inclined our notebook 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.850
 depending on whether we are right-handed 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.600
 or left-handed 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.600
