00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.320
 From this time on, I will look at the Chubu region 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:15.119
 The first one is Niigata Prefecture, which is shown here 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:21.390
 Well , the pubs in Niigata Prefecture are supposed to image the yukkii 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:27.240
 Yuuki Yuuki going to Niigata Prefecture will be the region with the highest amount of snowfall in Japan 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 It feels likely to get off a lot of snow species Hokkaido videos in the northeast of the north as a softening image 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 I want to explain where I am married 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.240
 this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.520
 The Sea of ​​Japan side has negative seasonal effects 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.550
 This is a lot of snow bath and I will introduce it later in Niigata later 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 There is a mountain range called the Chuo Central Mountain Range 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.329
 Just because clouds are stopped in this Echigo mountain range, this Niigata is really a lot of snow 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.230
 It falls 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:01:02.540
 It will be the largest region in Japan 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:06.979
 Such Niigata something but first prefectural office location confirmation Chunhua materials material city is that bean in the easy pattern 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:13.670
 It becomes prefectural office location Niigata city ​​of Niigata prefecture 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.220
 Even Niigata can be divided into three areas in fact as large as Fukushima we saw in the past 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.030
 It is blocked 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.830
 In the past, Niigata was called Echigo 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:31.430
 Let's explain this a little important for getting Niigata understanding 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:38.840
 Or if say So originally What does it mean I this edge child long ago eh O in this stone or Toyama 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.630
 Is now known as the country of the waist when viewed from the better of Kyoto's Tteyuu Niigata Toka Ne including Well after one and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.090
 The 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:51.119
 Is I was known as the country of Yue of Tteyuu now of chestnut outlet side 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:59.620
 Well , when I go from Kyoto to this Hokuriku region, I have to go over votes 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:02.620
 The whole Oh before when viewed from Kyoto among the countries of the waist that and was known as the country of Yue 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.070
 Say those who Echizen and 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:13.210
 So it was called now of Fukui Prefecture, and Kaga Echizen 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:18.370
 And now Toyama Prefecture is in the middle of Otsuke, the last 8 Niigata was called the British Governor 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.610
 Furthermore, this Echigo also has Joetsu City here. 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.080
 Same mechanism 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:29.810
 This Echigo Niigata can be divided into three major areas . 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.500
 One who is closest to Kyoto As a long time ago, a Muslim was a god and was good at it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 Joetsu from the south and then 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.160
 Zhou Wei 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.750
 The most northward one is coming to Shimotetsu 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.810
 From here I fellows this is that something you hear me Kaetsu there is an image such that the south 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:55.020
 It's not like Joetsu, Yue and Yue 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.290
 Have you ever heard even now as particularly critical is the Tteyuu this Joetsu In Toka Shinkansen Joetsu Shinkansen 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.830
 Even if 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.660
 remain 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:08.510
 Then, next time we look at the topography of Niigata Prefecture in detail 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:15.920
 It is Sado as soon as possible. There is an island called an island that operates 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.819
 Once upon a time is the US Sado Island Jinshan has been established gold hand a lot and clouds came out glanced a little while ago 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.560
 Damping 305 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:27.079
 It is Masu provisions from the old name of the Echigo 7 Niigata 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.079
 There is Echigo mountain range 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.300
 It is an after 300 and a big room including the Niigata city that is spreading here 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.470
 This is the Echigo Plain 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:48.600
 I can go if I learn this h language 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:52.470
 In I Ninen mean that flows through two large rivers in the Echigo Plain 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:04:00.770
 First of all, I want you to remember whether it 's here or here 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:00.770
 It is talk in this video to buy the longest time in Japan, and this is the Shinano river 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.880
 And I think that there is never here heard so much 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.880
 He is is called Agano 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.819
 Something 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.749
 Write this kind of Jo 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.749
 The video is 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:29.100
 Then if you say what kind of industry flourishes in this Niigata prefecture, this is also famous 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.100
 The right side is where a thriving rice farming rice 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:44.680
 The second is about this production Hokkaido of rice 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:49.320
 Especially in Niigata , as it was first, snow is so much winter that I got even during rice cultivation 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.320
 It is becoming a search single cropping area 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.800
 Well, the point is winter 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:05.190
 Because I can not make rice or eat other crops, I already have rice in spring and fall. 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:09.660
 The Echigo Plain but be made over a period of agriculture says I'm a child at the end with it Te search that sort of 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.190
 At the center Niigata is becoming a search area 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.940
 And among them, it is especially famous 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:22.270
 I think this has been heard because I 've never heard of Suganuma 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.440
 There is no movement in the name of the place, but Uonuma Koshihikari is already the highest grade in rice 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.840
 brand 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.960
 That's what it's been for over 20 years, where it's time to evaluate the taste of rice 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.180
 I have been taking top class evaluation 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.950
 Cho 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.390
 Let's take a look at the photo before the goal 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:44.900
 It looks delicious because I see it 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:48.400
 People who love to eat a little bit of rice just put in this fish and get fresh plump rice 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.400
