there's<00:02:01.259> definitely<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> learning<00:02:02.009> curve

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
there's definitely a learning curve

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.999 
there's definitely a learning curve
involved<00:02:02.729> I've<00:02:03.090> only<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.869> used<00:02:04.110> iOS<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Android tablets before and at times I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
Android tablets before and at times I
was<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> bit<00:02:07.979> lost<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.610> using<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.060> Dell<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
was a bit lost when using the Dell the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.110 
was a bit lost when using the Dell the
interface<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.530> extremely<00:02:11.250> gesture<00:02:11.849> heavy

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
interface is extremely gesture heavy

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.690 
interface is extremely gesture heavy
however<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.020> got<00:02:13.170> used<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
however as I got used to it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.699 
however as I got used to it
it<00:02:13.819> became<00:02:14.120> second<00:02:14.660> nature<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.590> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
it became second nature but this is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.680 
it became second nature but this is
definitely<00:02:16.069> something<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.940> think<00:02:17.060> about<00:02:17.330> when

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
definitely something to think about when

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.500 
definitely something to think about when
purchasing<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.260> tablet<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.390> probably<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
purchasing a tablet and probably the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030 
purchasing a tablet and probably the
biggest<00:02:20.720> difference<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.290> when<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.530> compare

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
biggest difference is when you compare

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.400 
biggest difference is when you compare
these<00:02:22.190> two<00:02:22.250> tablets<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:23.060> my<00:02:23.330> opinion<00:02:23.750> probably

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
these two tablets in my opinion probably

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.830 
these two tablets in my opinion probably
the<00:02:24.560> most<00:02:24.709> important<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.430> screen<00:02:26.239> clarity<00:02:26.720> as

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the most important is screen clarity as

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.290 
the most important is screen clarity as
well<00:02:27.019> as<00:02:27.140> contrast<00:02:27.800> when<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.519> got<00:02:28.700> down<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
well as contrast when you got down to it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.120 
well as contrast when you got down to it
I'm<00:02:29.420> pretty<00:02:29.930> sure<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.290> guys<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.680> see<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:30.980> in

I'm pretty sure you guys can see this in

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.250 
I'm pretty sure you guys can see this in
the<00:02:31.220> video<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.180> was<00:02:32.269> extremely<00:02:32.599> apparent

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the video but it was extremely apparent

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.170 
the video but it was extremely apparent
when<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.680> compare<00:02:34.099> these<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.489> side<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.970> side

of 1280 by 800 which is just

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.500
