00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
plug in this an tech try cool and see

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:57.330 
plug in this an tech try cool and see
how<00:03:45.720> they<00:03:45.870> compare

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.850 

important<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.000> note<00:03:58.180> my<00:03:58.330> treichel<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.020> on<00:03:59.530> the

even<00:04:09.640> close<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.360> exhales<00:04:11.200> way<00:04:12.300> way<00:04:13.300> more

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
even close the exhales way way more

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.949 
even close the exhales way way more
CFM's<00:04:14.470> by<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> lot<00:04:17.820> as<00:04:18.820> far<00:04:18.850> as<00:04:19.090> quietness<00:04:19.600> goes

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
CFM's by a lot as far as quietness goes

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.410 
CFM's by a lot as far as quietness goes
they're<00:04:20.350> pretty<00:04:20.590> much<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.769> same<00:04:20.950> exact<00:04:21.700> sound

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
they're pretty much the same exact sound

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.530 
they're pretty much the same exact sound
I<00:04:22.720> would<00:04:23.560> keep<00:04:23.830> this<00:04:23.980> try<00:04:24.310> cool<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.850> there<00:04:25.060> but

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
I would keep this try cool in there but

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.770 
I would keep this try cool in there but
it's<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.010> right<00:04:27.040> color<00:04:27.340> scheme<00:04:27.780> so

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
it's just not the right color scheme so

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.240 
it's just not the right color scheme so
this<00:04:28.870> one<00:04:29.050> doesn't<00:04:29.170> blow<00:04:29.500> itself<00:04:29.770> over<00:04:30.100> this

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this one doesn't blow itself over this

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.540 
this one doesn't blow itself over this
one<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:31.570> does<00:04:31.780> quite<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.260> bit<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.770> what<00:04:33.370> it's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
one it does quite a bit and what it's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.480 
one it does quite a bit and what it's
going<00:04:33.790> in<00:04:34.120> exactly<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:36.160> little

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
going in exactly is this this little

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.940 
going in exactly is this this little
wind<00:04:36.700> tunnel<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.330> path<00:04:37.990> comes<00:04:38.380> with<00:04:38.620> and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
wind tunnel that the path comes with and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.610 
wind tunnel that the path comes with and
what<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.669> does<00:04:39.990> I'm<00:04:40.990> sure<00:04:41.050> you've<00:04:41.350> seen<00:04:41.380> on

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
what it does I'm sure you've seen on

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.500 
what it does I'm sure you've seen on
other<00:04:41.830> videos<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.490> goes<00:04:42.669> right<00:04:42.940> here<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
other videos it goes right here and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.810 
other videos it goes right here and
there's<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.530> fan<00:04:44.740> in<00:04:44.770> here<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.580> blows

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
there's a fan in here and it blows

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.340 
there's a fan in here and it blows
across<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.270> graphics<00:04:46.810> cards<00:04:47.080> as<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.230> keep

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
across the graphics cards as it keep

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.970 
across the graphics cards as it keep
them<00:04:47.500> cool

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
them cool

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030 
them cool
and<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.840> has<00:04:49.990> more<00:04:50.140> CFM<00:04:50.560> so<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.740> should<00:04:50.919> get

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
and this has more CFM so I should get

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.830 
and this has more CFM so I should get
colder<00:04:51.430> results<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:55.180> yeah<00:04:55.270> that's<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.630> guys

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
colder results so yeah that's it guys

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.690 
colder results so yeah that's it guys
