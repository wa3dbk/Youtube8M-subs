energy normally something that returns a
lot<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> energy<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.809> hard<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
lot of energy is very hard we have a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
lot of energy is very hard we have a
unique<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.199> mousse<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
unique thing with this mousse to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
unique thing with this mousse to
technology<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.629> ultra<00:00:55.170> boost<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
technology so the ultra boost we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.849 
technology so the ultra boost we
introduced<00:00:56.309> boost<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.789> February<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> 2013<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
introduced boost in February of 2013 and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.270 
introduced boost in February of 2013 and
it<00:00:59.609> changed<00:01:00.149> everything<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:01.140> us<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.829> work

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it changed everything for us the work

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
it changed everything for us the work
the<00:01:02.460> world<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> deed<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.210> changed<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the world for a deed has changed in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.730 
the world for a deed has changed in
February<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> 2013<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.760> learned<00:01:06.740> just

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
February of 2013 and we learned just

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350 
February of 2013 and we learned just
like<00:01:07.890> adi<00:01:08.070> dassler<00:01:08.280> did<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> beginning

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
like adi dassler did from the beginning

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.590 
like adi dassler did from the beginning
of<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:10.170> great<00:01:10.409> company<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.670> learn<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of our great company is you learn you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
of our great company is you learn you
modify<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.750> what

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
modify and you and you make and so what

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
modify and you and you make and so what
we<00:01:16.700> learned<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:19.080> only<00:01:19.350> did

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
we learned from this was not only did

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.210 
we learned from this was not only did
this<00:01:19.820> material<00:01:20.820> absorb<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.570> energy<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
this material absorb more energy and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.440 
this material absorb more energy and
reabsorb<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.400> impact<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> return<00:01:24.270> more

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
reabsorb more impact and return more

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.929 
reabsorb more impact and return more
energy<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> difficult<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.670> never

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
energy which is difficult like never

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
energy which is difficult like never
before<00:01:27.330> done<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> also<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
before done like this but it also is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.899 
before done like this but it also is
very<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.720> flexible<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.100> normally<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.640> have

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
very very flexible so normally you have

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.300 
very very flexible so normally you have
to<00:01:33.060> cut<00:01:33.420> big<00:01:33.689> grooves<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> bottom<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to cut big grooves in the bottom of a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
to cut big grooves in the bottom of a
shoe<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.180> something<00:01:36.420> flexible<00:01:36.720> with

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
shoe to make something flexible with

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.130 
shoe to make something flexible with
boost<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.450> very

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
boost you don't have to it's just very

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.280 
boost you don't have to it's just very
very<00:01:40.320> flexible<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.939> foot<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.990> foot

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
very flexible your foot and my foot

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
very flexible your foot and my foot
might<00:01:43.680> measure<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.250> same<00:01:44.490> length<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
might measure the same length but we

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
might measure the same length but we
might<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.290> different<00:01:46.500> areas<00:01:47.040> where<00:01:47.250> our

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
might have different areas where our

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.270 
might have different areas where our
foot<00:01:47.640> flexes<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
foot flexes you know so we don't have to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
foot flexes you know so we don't have to
worry<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:50.700> does<00:01:51.240> our<00:01:51.360> flex<00:01:51.630> groove<00:01:51.869> match

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
worry about does our flex groove match

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.649 
worry about does our flex groove match
Silvio's<00:01:52.979> foot<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.520> foot<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.630> to

Silvio's foot in my foot it's going to
work<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:54.899> both<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.470> us<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.219> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
work for both of us because we have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.359 
work for both of us because we have
boost<00:01:56.640> underneath<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> entire<00:01:57.810> foot<00:01:58.369> the

look as you saw the Aramus machine where

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.160 
look as you saw the Aramus machine where
we<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:05.520> looked<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> deformation<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
we we looked at the deformation what is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
we we looked at the deformation what is
the<00:02:07.290> foot<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.860> sport<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> moves<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the foot do in sport it moves and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
the foot do in sport it moves and
expands<00:02:10.110> deforms<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.250> one<00:02:11.520> centimeter

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.170 
expands deforms up to one centimeter
during<00:02:12.850> sport<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.630> let's<00:02:14.640> harness<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.970> power

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
during sport so let's harness the power

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.480 
during sport so let's harness the power
of<00:02:16.360> boost<00:02:16.720> these<00:02:17.200> individual<00:02:18.069> energy

so<00:02:22.300> at<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.709> heart<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.220> boost<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.760> on

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so at the heart of it is boost and on

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.580 
so at the heart of it is boost and on
the<00:02:25.090> outsole<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> new<00:02:25.900> stretch<00:02:26.319> web
