that we are in the city of Pflugerville
Texas<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.629> have<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> project<00:00:13.170> today<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.070 

nice<00:00:17.550> garden<00:00:17.970> table<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:18.690> gonna<00:00:18.810> show

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
nice garden table that we're gonna show

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.050 
nice garden table that we're gonna show
you<00:00:19.110> here<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.890> jacuzzi<00:00:20.520> Tony's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you here it's like jacuzzi Tony's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.110 
you here it's like jacuzzi Tony's
gelatin<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.340> here's<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.700> problem

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
gelatin and so here's the problem

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.840 
gelatin and so here's the problem
the<00:00:24.540> homeowner<00:00:25.170> does<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.950> care<00:00:26.280> much<00:00:26.520> about

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
the homeowner does not care much about

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.200 
the homeowner does not care much about
having<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.020> resurfaced<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.700> you<00:00:29.850> look<00:00:30.030> at

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
having it resurfaced but if you look at

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.450 
having it resurfaced but if you look at
that<00:00:30.450> mean<00:00:30.869> crack<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.369> appeared<00:00:33.110> it's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
that mean crack that it appeared it's

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460 
that mean crack that it appeared it's
really<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.060> really<00:00:36.210> cracking<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> whole

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
really it's really cracking this whole

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.220 
really it's really cracking this whole
thing<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.310> the<00:00:39.090> bottom<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.840> strong

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
thing down so the bottom is very strong

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
thing down so the bottom is very strong
that's<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> problem<00:00:41.840> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.190> is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that's not a problem but it is that is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010 
that's not a problem but it is that is
cracking<00:00:44.880> because<00:00:45.270> there's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
cracking because there's a lot of a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
cracking because there's a lot of a
stress<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.860> must<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> gap<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
stress and there must be a gap in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
stress and there must be a gap in
between<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> shower<00:00:49.590> floor<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.550> top<00:00:50.760> floor

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
between the shower floor the top floor

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.740 
between the shower floor the top floor
and<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.829> bottom<00:00:53.220> underneath<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and the the bottom underneath and so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.940 
and the the bottom underneath and so
what<00:00:54.930> we're<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.200> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.410> we're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.569 
what we're going to do we're going to
create<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:58.110> going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> fill<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
create a we're going to fill that in the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.389 
create a we're going to fill that in the
space<00:00:59.880> in<00:01:00.120> between<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> it'll<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.219> very

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
space in between so it'll make it very

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
space in between so it'll make it very
strong<00:01:02.520> once<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> we're<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.649> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
strong once we have that we're going to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.699 
strong once we have that we're going to
be<00:01:04.890> able<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.189> apply<00:01:06.000> marine<00:01:06.600> filler<00:01:06.929> to<00:01:07.439> fix

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:07.709 
be able to apply marine filler to fix

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.370 
be able to apply marine filler to fix
those<00:01:07.950> cracks<00:01:08.340> once<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
those cracks once we have that we're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.529 
those cracks once we have that we're
gonna<00:01:10.560> refinish<00:01:10.950> we're<00:01:11.819> going<00:01:11.969> to<00:01:12.090> create<00:01:12.389> a

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
gonna refinish we're going to create a

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.359 
gonna refinish we're going to create a
line<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.259> about<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.780> get<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.039> hold<00:01:17.039> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
line just about what that get it hold is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
line just about what that get it hold is
all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:18.029> around<00:01:18.389> we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.959> blend

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
all the way around we're going to blend

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
all the way around we're going to blend
it<00:01:19.319> we're<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.859> mix<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> color<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.209> make

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it we're going to mix the color to make

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
it we're going to mix the color to make
it<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.689> close<00:01:21.959> as<00:01:22.020> possible<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.249> we're<00:01:23.490> going

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it as close as possible and we're going

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
it as close as possible and we're going
to<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.999> so<00:01:24.569> we're<00:01:24.929> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> show<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> how

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it looks after we're done so we're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620

let's<00:01:38.890> remember<00:01:39.340> as<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.240> remember<00:01:40.659> before

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
let's remember as you remember before

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.249 
let's remember as you remember before
there<00:01:41.920> was<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> big<00:01:42.460> crack<00:01:42.880> there<00:01:43.180> what<00:01:43.930> we<00:01:44.049> did

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
there was a big crack there what we did

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.219 
there was a big crack there what we did
we<00:01:44.470> did<00:01:44.650> seven<00:01:45.130> holes<00:01:45.400> in<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.570> bottom<00:01:46.900> three

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
we did seven holes in the bottom three

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.770 
we did seven holes in the bottom three
corner<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.650> twelves<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.340> we<00:01:49.000> apply<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.420> foam

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
corner in twelves and we apply the foam

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.310 
corner in twelves and we apply the foam
that<00:01:50.020> we<00:01:51.180> use<00:01:52.180> me<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:55.290> resurface<00:01:56.290> the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
that we use me and then we resurface the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.190 
that we use me and then we resurface the
bottom<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:57.520> make<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:57.970> even<00:01:58.270> there<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
bottom to make it all even there and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.810 
bottom to make it all even there and
make<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.560> repairs<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.250> make<00:02:00.399> all<00:02:00.670> those

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
make the repairs and make all those

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.980 
make the repairs and make all those
repairs<00:02:02.729> visible<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.570> area

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
repairs visible and so this is the area

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.910 
repairs visible and so this is the area
is<00:02:08.920> very<00:02:09.840> strong<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:11.530> that's<00:02:11.739> gonna

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
is very strong and I think that's gonna

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.340 
is very strong and I think that's gonna
hold<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.340> crack<00:02:12.670> from<00:02:12.910> coming<00:02:13.870> back<00:02:14.050> again

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
hold the crack from coming back again

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.880 
hold the crack from coming back again
thank<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.489> watching
