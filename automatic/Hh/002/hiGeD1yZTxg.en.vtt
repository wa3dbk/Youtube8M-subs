00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.369
 sneakers as a gift write to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.930
 comments and I will answer a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.149
 Today, the story of what you can for example 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.750
 get a gift or give to someone 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.550
 a gift for the previous one even for the future 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.520
 holidays are here after the new year already 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.350
 all words are forgotten and so can 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.280
 get for the coming holidays 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 namely on any there on February 23 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.489
 Christmas may be March 8 start 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.949
 story with the next modernized 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.719
 versions of classic sneakers remember yes 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.550
 that I have all the same to such sneakers 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.010
 but I like a certain passion 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.319
 classic silhouettes in penza 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.829
 new technologies urine 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:06.729
 for example on the example of these lunar 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.160
 89 year old pegasus 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.710
 the third year of the Pegasus is 30 years old 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.840
 Have you been sneakers for 30 years now ? 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.770
 still wear them still respect 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.960
 They still love sneakers in '89 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.090
 they certainly will sing a little not 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 but it is also very popular that to me 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.720
 liked what did he like 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.760
 just took and changed one sole on 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.480
 another one but I added some interesting ones 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.940
 details 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.920
 changed a bit about modern materials 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.420
 in general, sneakers honestly say yes 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.520
 when i first saw these 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.520
 I didn't even have sneakers 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.250
 of some question is this 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.170
 some pegasi 80th year did not say that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.170
 it 's something modern but understandable 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.480
 that everything new is well forgotten and slightly 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.400
 recycled old as happened to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.160
 these pegasi which in my opinion 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.120
 very suitable for early spring and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.240
 This is not really 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.370
 winter or snowy winter by the way about winter 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.400
 we got a huge amount of feedback 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.070
 On our issue dedicated precisely 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.570
 winter sneaker is understandable that once 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.789
 it's so popular why in this 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.920
 popular topic no further development 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.849
 and we decided to talk about the whole family 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.440
 running shoes called sneaker bus 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.990
 invented this idea was on 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.580
 right through to the very popular 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.650
 last year in winter 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.300
 air force one so booth remember these 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.130
 sneakers about which we have more than once 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 told this year they were 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.510
 reissued also in the snicker series will 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.250
 honestly we wanted to tell and 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.720
 about them but they were all sold out 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.720
 on juice they are popular 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.730
 even without my program them of course 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 but phenomenally well, we will tell 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.600
 little other models let's go what 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 called from the oldest sneaker 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.650
 when I even saw the whole series of snicker 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.950
 boots and saw there are these sneakers under 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.710
 called lunar l9 mid I immediately thought 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.870
 Klima invented what to reprint and 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.910
 rethinking old sneakers added 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.850
 some new model and what was 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.950
 my surprise when i remembered that ldv 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.620
 it 's such old old running 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.870
 sneakers since the 70s when they 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.480
 were transferred in 2000 and was 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.550
 The trail version from the sole is also transmitted. 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.020
 specifically for the crossed in version 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.330
 they were very popular 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.360
 even now the Internet can be found 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.950
 many reviews of old sneakers 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.080
 am spruce sneakers so they 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.850
 liked the people well and understandably that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.380
 once you liked it all, why not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.780
 make these sneakers 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.580
 also in the winter performance and here 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.880
 turned out such a wonderful winter 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.860
 Sneakers except for this enough 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.290
 warm performance we see here yet 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.580
 the soles of the lunarlon and and that too 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.760
 important for winter sneakers 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.130
 it is a trail sole that is such a sole 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.290
 to the most but slippery on uneven 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.300
 some surfaces and we go to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.700
 the following sneakers from the seventies 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.250
 jump immediately in the nineties namely in 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.370
 classic 90 airmaks in the winter 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.630
 performance but what's clear that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.300
 general silhouette 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.190
 these are classic 90 max and but they still 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.980
 equipped with such a warm neoprene 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.250
 sock in which your foot will be small 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.290
 that is convenient so still and warm and for 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.420
 winter is very important and of itself is 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.519
 the decision is also made from modern 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.040
 materials that are very well cleaned 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 very well washed honestly tell u 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.360
 I have such huge sneakers 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.520
 thanks to nike i go to them and not 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.220
 rejoice it is really very convenient 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.910
 very good sneaker like for those who 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.100
 does not want to change 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.810
 physical silhouette even in winter and 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.330
 Of course, too, such small details 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.610
 who make these sneakers 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.530
 more winter that the sole though drawing 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.930
 the soles seem almost the same as 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.000
 on the classic nineties max here 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.430
 there are small spikes which also 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.250
 perfectly responsible for grip 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.530
 unstable road in winter and 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.720
 such studded tires can be said 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.090
 demi-season theme sneaker in general 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.890
 she is very interesting very saturated in 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.080
 these sneakers really a lot 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.150
 interesting and do not want to tell 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.000
 much so we go back to the stories about 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.490
 them and in our next issue yet 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.330
 Thank you very much for your attention with you. 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.150
 Dmitry Egorov 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:16.120
