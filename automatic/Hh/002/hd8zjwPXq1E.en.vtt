so it's been three years now since I

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.450 
so it's been three years now since I
changed<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> motor<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.240> converted<00:00:09.690> by<00:00:10.460> 1979

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
changed the motor and converted by 1979

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.570 
changed the motor and converted by 1979

troubles I had with it over the three

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.029 
troubles I had with it over the three
years<00:00:26.449> few<00:00:27.449> things<00:00:27.689> well<00:00:28.380> first<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
years few things well first thing that

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
years few things well first thing that
went<00:00:29.189> wrong<00:00:29.400> after<00:00:29.670> less<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.330> year<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
went wrong after less than a year is the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.190 
went wrong after less than a year is the
togs<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.309> come<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.880> grab<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> starting

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
togs that come out and grab the starting

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260 
togs that come out and grab the starting
cup<00:00:34.410> weren't<00:00:35.190> getting<00:00:35.399> enough<00:00:35.489> friction<00:00:35.850> on

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
cup weren't getting enough friction on

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
cup weren't getting enough friction on
the<00:00:36.960> thing<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.469> ride<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.730> were

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the thing they ride on so they were

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
the thing they ride on so they were
slipping<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.870> yanked<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> thing

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
slipping and you just yanked the thing

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
slipping and you just yanked the thing
and<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> sudden<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.309> about<00:00:41.489> rip<00:00:41.700> your

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and all of a sudden just about rip your

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
and all of a sudden just about rip your
elbow<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> simple<00:00:43.710> fix<00:00:43.890> take

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
elbow out so that was a simple fix take

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.180 
elbow out so that was a simple fix take
it<00:00:44.250> apart<00:00:44.550> adjust<00:00:45.450> things<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.950> they

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it apart adjust things in there and they

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.619 
it apart adjust things in there and they
got<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.550> friction<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.360> come<00:00:48.570> out

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
got more friction so then they come out

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.139 
got more friction so then they come out
every<00:00:48.750> time<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> pull<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.370> wasn't<00:00:50.730> until<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
every time you pull it wasn't until this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
every time you pull it wasn't until this
year<00:00:51.210> three<00:00:51.660> years<00:00:51.870> later<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> string

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
year three years later that the string

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
year three years later that the string
finally<00:00:53.039> broke<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.420> poor<00:00:54.690> quality

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
finally broke they do have poor quality

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
finally broke they do have poor quality
string<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.250> thing<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.670> Chinese<00:00:57.180> stuff<00:00:57.539> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
string the thing with Chinese stuff that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
string the thing with Chinese stuff that
they<00:00:57.840> clone<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.890> looks<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> real

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they clone is it looks like the real

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.979 
they clone is it looks like the real
thing<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> looks<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
thing you know it looks like a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
thing you know it looks like a
motorcycle<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> looks<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.340> engine<00:01:02.699> it

motorcycle it looks like an engine it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
motorcycle it looks like an engine it
actually<00:01:03.239> runs<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> works<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.019> whatever<00:01:04.229> when

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
actually runs and works or whatever when

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
actually runs and works or whatever when
you<00:01:04.530> buy<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> everything's<00:01:06.450> made<00:01:06.720> thinner

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you buy it but everything's made thinner

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200 
you buy it but everything's made thinner
and<00:01:07.380> cheaper<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.790> poor<00:01:08.970> quality

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and cheaper or have poor quality

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
and cheaper or have poor quality
materials<00:01:09.930> when<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.650> supposed<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> have

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
materials when you're supposed to have

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.219 
materials when you're supposed to have
gaskets<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:11.820> tubes<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.420> whatever<00:01:12.810> made<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.140> of

like pull ropes and stuff they're just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
like pull ropes and stuff they're just
made<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.450> cheap<00:01:22.020> whatever<00:01:22.470> cotton<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.220> they

don't last long the metal on the casing
and<00:01:26.700> tank<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.330> frames<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.350> motorcycles<00:01:28.979> it's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and tank and frames on motorcycles it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.130 
and tank and frames on motorcycles it's
just<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.460> thin<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.390> carbon<00:01:30.869> steel

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
just so thin and it's not carbon steel

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.039 
just so thin and it's not carbon steel
or<00:01:31.799> doesn't<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.810> molybdenum<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.020> a

strong<00:01:34.710> additives<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.869> bend

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
strong additives to it so they just bend

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.280 
strong additives to it so they just bend
or<00:01:37.439> crack<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:40.079> like

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
or crack you know they just look like

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.749 
or crack you know they just look like
the<00:01:40.470> real<00:01:40.619> thing<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.070> they're<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.400> made<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the real thing but they're just made of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.300 
the real thing but they're just made of
at<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> lowest<00:01:42.270> quality<00:01:42.630> materials<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> they

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
at the lowest quality materials and they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.620 
at the lowest quality materials and they
just<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.270> designed

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
just they're you know they're designed

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
just they're you know they're designed
well<00:01:45.869> usually<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
well usually but if they just use a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.609 
well usually but if they just use a
little<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.479> better<00:01:48.630> calling<00:01:48.960> materials

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
little bit better calling materials

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
little bit better calling materials
the<00:01:50.250> Japanese<00:01:50.670> companies<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.299> some

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the Japanese companies would have some

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
the Japanese companies would have some
competition<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.250> subject<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
competition so on that subject the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630 
competition so on that subject the
rocker<00:01:54.990> cover<00:01:55.140> gasket<00:01:55.920> started<00:01:56.219> leaking<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
rocker cover gasket started leaking a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
rocker cover gasket started leaking a
lot<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.060> well<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.950> a<00:02:00.350> rubber<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
lot and well it was just a rubber a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.389 
lot and well it was just a rubber a
neoprene<00:02:02.070> seal<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.680> went<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> Honda

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
neoprene seal so I just went to a Honda

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
neoprene seal so I just went to a Honda
dealer<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> bought<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.390> part<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
dealer and bought the right part and it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
dealer and bought the right part and it
works<00:02:07.290> perfect<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.829> doesn't<00:02:08.069> leak<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.340> all

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
works perfect and doesn't leak at all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.479 
works perfect and doesn't leak at all
know<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.470> venting<00:02:11.009> tube<00:02:11.220> was

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
know this little venting tube was

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.640 
know this little venting tube was
collapsing<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> falling<00:02:12.390> apart

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
collapsing and falling apart

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
collapsing and falling apart
the<00:02:13.709> PCB<00:02:14.250> gasses<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.879> that's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> Honda<00:02:15.450> tube

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
the PCB gasses so that's a Honda tube

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.149 
the PCB gasses so that's a Honda tube
now<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.019> it's<00:02:16.140> fine<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.450> gasket<00:02:18.930> under<00:02:19.170> here

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.100 

all<00:02:23.159> fell<00:02:23.579> apart<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.090> tracked<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> bought<00:02:25.079> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
all fell apart and tracked so I bought a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.369 
all fell apart and tracked so I bought a
Honda<00:02:25.409> gasket<00:02:26.689> well<00:02:27.689> it<00:02:27.840> used<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.349> a

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
Honda gasket well it used to have a

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.349 
Honda gasket well it used to have a
little<00:02:28.620> window<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> little

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
little window in there with a little

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.729 
little window in there with a little
fuel<00:02:30.900> gauge<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.439> it

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
fuel gauge on it

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.789 
fuel gauge on it
well<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.430> plastic<00:02:33.000> only<00:02:33.390> held<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:34.560> only

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
well that plastic only held they only

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.500 
well that plastic only held they only
work<00:02:35.099> with<00:02:35.280> gastrea<00:02:35.819> but<00:02:35.939> a<00:02:35.970> couple<00:02:36.209> months

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
work with gastrea but a couple months

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
work with gastrea but a couple months
and<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> became<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.500> cloudy<00:02:37.799> you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and then it became so cloudy you

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.410 
and then it became so cloudy you
couldn't<00:02:38.340> see<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.819> formed<00:02:39.180> cracks

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
couldn't see it then it formed cracks

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.819 
couldn't see it then it formed cracks
and<00:02:39.689> started<00:02:39.900> leaking<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.379> then<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:40.650> day

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
and started leaking and then one day

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.059 
and started leaking and then one day
just<00:02:40.859> vibration<00:02:41.730> knocked<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> just

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
just vibration knocked it out so I just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.649 
just vibration knocked it out so I just
welded<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.579> up<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.970> third<00:02:48.239> year<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
welded it up on the third year the

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.390 
welded it up on the third year the
on/off<00:02:49.079> switch<00:02:49.109> just<00:02:49.650> disintegrated<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
on/off switch just disintegrated and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.750 
on/off switch just disintegrated and
fell<00:02:50.609> apart<00:02:50.879> just<00:02:51.060> by<00:02:51.239> vibration<00:02:52.489> every<00:02:53.489> year

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
fell apart just by vibration every year

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.759 
fell apart just by vibration every year
needs<00:02:54.090> its<00:02:54.329> two<00:02:54.599> rocker<00:02:54.840> arms<00:02:55.200> adjusted<00:02:55.650> or

needs its two rocker arms adjusted or

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.500 
needs its two rocker arms adjusted or
they<00:02:55.859> start<00:02:56.129> rattling<00:02:56.459> loud<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.359> don't

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
they start rattling loud if you don't

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.660 
they start rattling loud if you don't
adjust<00:02:57.659> them<00:02:58.019> eventually<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.530> little<00:02:58.739> push

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
adjust them eventually the little push

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.470 
adjust them eventually the little push
rods<00:02:59.909> pop<00:03:00.209> off<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.349> stops<00:03:01.560> running

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
rods pop off then it stops running

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.479 
rods pop off then it stops running
amazingly<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.840> doesn't<00:03:04.200> burn<00:03:04.349> any<00:03:04.620> oil<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
amazingly it doesn't burn any oil and it

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.550 
amazingly it doesn't burn any oil and it
gets<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.849> lot<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.209> use<00:03:06.689> cutting<00:03:07.170> my<00:03:07.290> five

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560

and<00:03:45.260> no<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.919> lot<00:03:47.190> smoother<00:03:47.609> running<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:48.120> lot

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
and no it's a lot smoother running a lot

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.119 
and no it's a lot smoother running a lot
less<00:03:48.599> vibration<00:03:49.199> so<00:03:49.379> less<00:03:49.560> fatigue<00:03:49.919> when

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
less vibration so less fatigue when

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.920 
less vibration so less fatigue when
you're<00:03:50.250> cutting<00:03:50.400> dress<00:03:50.760> now<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.629> most

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you're cutting dress now the most

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.770 
you're cutting dress now the most
problems<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:52.530> had<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.889> with<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.220> carburetor

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
problems I had is with the carburetor

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.619 
problems I had is with the carburetor
first<00:03:54.780> thing<00:03:55.079> is<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:56.609> little<00:03:56.849> filter<00:03:57.150> mesh<00:03:57.479> in

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
first thing is the little filter mesh in

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:58.909 
first thing is the little filter mesh in
the<00:03:57.720> bottom<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.109> gas<00:03:58.290> tank<00:03:58.590> where<00:03:58.799> the

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
the bottom of the gas tank where the

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.670 
the bottom of the gas tank where the
fuel<00:03:59.159> line<00:03:59.370> comes<00:03:59.669> out<00:03:59.930> allows<00:04:00.930> fine<00:04:01.349> pieces

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
fuel line comes out allows fine pieces

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.009 
fuel line comes out allows fine pieces
of<00:04:01.919> dirt<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.250> grass<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.669> come<00:04:02.879> through<00:04:03.150> they

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
of dirt and grass to come through they

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.689 
of dirt and grass to come through they
get<00:04:04.229> stuck<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.739> needle<00:04:04.949> and<00:04:05.129> seat<00:04:05.370> and

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
get stuck in a needle and seat and

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.309 
get stuck in a needle and seat and
sometimes<00:04:06.120> when<00:04:06.329> you<00:04:06.419> park<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.109> just

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
sometimes when you park it it just

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.110 
sometimes when you park it it just
overflows<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:08.040> carb<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.549> don't<00:04:08.729> shut<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
overflows the carb if you don't shut the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.089 
overflows the carb if you don't shut the
gas<00:04:09.269> valve<00:04:09.599> off<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.319> fills<00:04:10.680> up<00:04:10.889> your

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
gas valve off and fills up your

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.300 
gas valve off and fills up your
crankcase<00:04:11.760> with<00:04:12.079> gas<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.709> if<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.949> took<00:04:14.129> off

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
crankcase with gas and if you took off

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.460 
crankcase with gas and if you took off
and<00:04:14.519> didn't<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.139> well<00:04:16.139> then<00:04:16.320> you've

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and didn't know that well then you've

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.250 
and didn't know that well then you've
got<00:04:16.620> gas<00:04:16.829> mixed<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:17.310> your<00:04:17.400> oil<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.260> you

got gas mixed with your oil and you
could<00:04:19.440> fry<00:04:19.680> your<00:04:19.919> motor<00:04:20.159> so<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.760> couple<00:04:21.000> times<00:04:21.269> I

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
could fry your motor so a couple times I

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.000 
could fry your motor so a couple times I
notice<00:04:21.779> and<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:21.989> had<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> change<00:04:22.469> the<00:04:22.529> oil<00:04:22.650> and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
notice and I had to change the oil and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.649 
notice and I had to change the oil and
blow<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.639> dirt<00:04:23.789> out<00:04:23.969> of<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> needle<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.419> seat

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
blow the dirt out of the needle and seat

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.470 
blow the dirt out of the needle and seat
back<00:04:25.469> to<00:04:25.500> poor<00:04:25.919> quality<00:04:26.250> materials

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
back to poor quality materials

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.670 
back to poor quality materials
in<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.080> car<00:04:28.290> vault<00:04:28.620> like<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> Honda<00:04:29.670> it's<00:04:30.090> got<00:04:30.240> a

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
in the car vault like a Honda it's got a

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.470 
in the car vault like a Honda it's got a
solid<00:04:31.680> plaster<00:04:32.280> well<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.640> solid<00:04:33.030> it's<00:04:33.330> got

solid plaster well not a solid it's got

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.520 
solid plaster well not a solid it's got
a<00:04:33.510> plastic<00:04:33.990> float

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
a plastic float

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.830 
a plastic float
well<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.370> plastic<00:04:35.790> float<00:04:36.090> distorts<00:04:36.720> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
well the plastic float distorts and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.540 
well the plastic float distorts and
changes<00:04:37.320> over<00:04:37.350> time<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.040> after<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> first

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
changes over time and after the first

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.820 
changes over time and after the first
year<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.030> half<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.960> thing<00:04:40.170> would<00:04:40.350> drive

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
year and a half the thing would drive

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.500 
year and a half the thing would drive
for<00:04:41.100> about<00:04:41.310> ten<00:04:41.580> minutes<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.180> run

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
for about ten minutes and then just run

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.970 
for about ten minutes and then just run
out<00:04:42.630> of<00:04:42.660> gas<00:04:42.780> every<00:04:43.110> time<00:04:43.440> let<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.710> sit<00:04:43.950> a

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
out of gas every time let it sit a

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.290 
out of gas every time let it sit a
couple<00:04:44.250> minutes<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.700> would<00:04:44.820> fire<00:04:45.060> right

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
couple minutes and it would fire right

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.450 
couple minutes and it would fire right
up<00:04:45.420> again<00:04:45.720> took<00:04:46.500> me<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> long<00:04:46.890> time<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.280> figure

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
up again took me a long time to figure

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.950 
up again took me a long time to figure
out<00:04:47.640> what<00:04:47.760> was<00:04:47.850> causing<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.300> cap<00:04:48.600> thought<00:04:48.810> it

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
out what was causing the cap thought it

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.380 
out what was causing the cap thought it
was<00:04:49.080> restriction<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.740> fuel<00:04:50.010> line<00:04:50.390> or

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
was restriction in the fuel line or

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.140 
was restriction in the fuel line or
grass<00:04:52.170> or<00:04:52.500> dirt<00:04:52.530> getting<00:04:52.890> caught<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
grass or dirt getting caught in the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.460 
grass or dirt getting caught in the
little<00:04:54.420> nipple<00:04:54.750> where<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:54.990> goes<00:04:55.080> into<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
little nipple where it goes into the

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.030 
little nipple where it goes into the
carb<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.720> turned<00:04:57.930> out<00:04:58.080> distortion<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.010> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
carb but it turned out distortion in the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.910 
carb but it turned out distortion in the
float<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.930> wasn't<00:05:01.110> allowing<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.710> float

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
float and it wasn't allowing the float

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.320 
float and it wasn't allowing the float
to<00:05:02.100> fall<00:05:02.280> down<00:05:02.460> all<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.790> way<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.090> little

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
to fall down all the way the little

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.090 
to fall down all the way the little
stopper<00:05:03.720> thing<00:05:03.930> that<00:05:04.080> lets<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.560> fall<00:05:04.740> down<00:05:04.950> as

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
stopper thing that lets it fall down as

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.160 
stopper thing that lets it fall down as
far<00:05:05.310> as<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:05.550> supposed<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.880> fall<00:05:06.120> down<00:05:06.170> it's

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
far as it's supposed to fall down it's

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.230 
far as it's supposed to fall down it's
just<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.470> little<00:05:07.740> piece<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.220> plastic<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.820> it

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
just a little piece of plastic and it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.930 
just a little piece of plastic and it
just<00:05:09.510> bends<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.260> wrong<00:05:10.410> way<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.950> stops<00:05:11.790> it

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
just bends the wrong way and stops it

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.520 
just bends the wrong way and stops it
from<00:05:11.970> falling<00:05:12.360> down<00:05:12.480> far<00:05:12.780> enough<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:13.020> let<00:05:13.260> fuel

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
from falling down far enough to let fuel

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.560 
from falling down far enough to let fuel
and<00:05:13.740> fast<00:05:13.980> enough<00:05:14.280> as<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.610> burning<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:15.090> with

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
and fast enough as it's burning it with

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.660 
and fast enough as it's burning it with
a<00:05:15.630> pair<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:15.870> side<00:05:16.170> cutters<00:05:16.200> that<00:05:17.070> cut<00:05:17.340> some<00:05:17.580> of

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
a pair of side cutters that cut some of

would fall back down to its normal level
that<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.530> falls<00:05:22.740> with<00:05:23.160> no<00:05:23.400> fuel<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:24.090> that

that it falls with no fuel and that
fixed<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.080> problem<00:05:25.400> like<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.430> said<00:05:26.730> it

that costs a lot less and seems to be

that costs a lot less and seems to be
better<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.150> every<00:06:15.390> way

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
better in every way

well<00:06:16.590> except<00:06:17.070> for<00:06:17.100> quality<00:06:17.880> of<00:06:17.970> materials<00:06:18.450> I'm

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
well except for quality of materials I'm

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.720 
well except for quality of materials I'm
happy

well<00:06:20.730> that's<00:06:20.940> which<00:06:21.150> fell<00:06:21.390> apart<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:22.070> that's

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
well that's which fell apart so that's

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.370 
well that's which fell apart so that's
my<00:06:23.280> on/off<00:06:23.640> switch<00:06:23.880> now<00:06:24.170> the<00:06:25.170> only

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
my on/off switch now the only

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.880 
my on/off switch now the only
modification<00:06:25.680> I<00:06:26.190> recommend<00:06:26.700> is<00:06:26.880> just<00:06:26.910> putting

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
modification I recommend is just putting

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.250 
modification I recommend is just putting
little<00:06:28.890> inline<00:06:29.310> filter<00:06:29.790> in<00:06:30.180> that<00:06:30.900> fuel<00:06:31.200> line

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
little inline filter in that fuel line

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.740 
little inline filter in that fuel line
if<00:06:32.220> you're<00:06:32.400> using<00:06:32.580> it<00:06:32.820> for<00:06:32.850> purposes<00:06:33.180> like<00:06:33.570> me

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
if you're using it for purposes like me

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
into the engine so you don't get those

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.060 
into the engine so you don't get those
fuel<00:06:36.720> leaks<00:06:36.960> which<00:06:37.170> could<00:06:37.350> possibly<00:06:37.530> kill

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
reinforce it with angle iron to support

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.140 
reinforce it with angle iron to support
itself<00:07:01.890> that<00:07:02.890> makes<00:07:03.160> it<00:07:03.340> really<00:07:03.730> good<00:07:04.030> at

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
itself that makes it really good at

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.720 
itself that makes it really good at
cutting<00:07:04.360> really<00:07:05.110> deep<00:07:05.320> grass<00:07:05.650> seems<00:07:06.250> crazy<00:07:06.520> to

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
cutting really deep grass seems crazy to

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.130 
cutting really deep grass seems crazy to
take<00:07:06.910> a<00:07:06.970> perfectly<00:07:07.180> good<00:07:07.450> TechEd<00:07:07.780> and<00:07:07.990> just

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
take a perfectly good TechEd and just

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.020 
take a perfectly good TechEd and just
cut<00:07:08.320> out<00:07:08.440> the<00:07:08.560> front<00:07:08.830> but<00:07:09.040> doesn't<00:07:09.730> bend<00:07:09.910> the

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
cut out the front but doesn't bend the

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.580 
cut out the front but doesn't bend the
grass<00:07:10.240> and<00:07:10.480> weeds<00:07:10.630> over<00:07:10.810> they<00:07:11.140> stand<00:07:11.440> up

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
grass and weeds over they stand up

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.500 
grass and weeds over they stand up
pretty<00:07:11.770> good<00:07:12.010> before<00:07:12.160> they<00:07:12.460> get<00:07:12.610> chopped<00:07:12.910> so

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
pretty good before they get chopped so

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.900 
pretty good before they get chopped so
it's<00:07:13.630> very<00:07:13.780> effective<00:07:14.400> and<00:07:15.400> since<00:07:15.670> I'm<00:07:15.760> not

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
it's very effective and since I'm not

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.800 
it's very effective and since I'm not
running<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.300> hood<00:07:16.450> on<00:07:16.630> it

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
running the hood on it

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.200 
running the hood on it
I<00:07:16.960> had<00:07:17.650> to<00:07:17.770> weld<00:07:17.950> this<00:07:18.130> washing<00:07:18.610> machine<00:07:18.670> back

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
I had to weld this washing machine back

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.360 
I had to weld this washing machine back
on<00:07:19.420> there<00:07:19.690> to<00:07:20.380> prevent<00:07:20.740> the<00:07:20.860> grass<00:07:21.100> that's

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
on there to prevent the grass that's

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.790 
on there to prevent the grass that's
flying<00:07:21.700> out<00:07:22.000> flying<00:07:22.870> all<00:07:23.080> over<00:07:23.110> the<00:07:23.260> place<00:07:23.530> now

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
flying out flying all over the place now

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.590 
flying out flying all over the place now
without<00:07:24.070> the<00:07:24.310> front<00:07:24.520> of<00:07:24.610> the<00:07:24.670> deck<00:07:24.820> on<00:07:25.000> from

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600 
without the front of the deck on from

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.690 
without the front of the deck on from
getting<00:07:25.840> sucked<00:07:26.110> into<00:07:26.320> the<00:07:26.530> pull<00:07:27.400> starter

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
getting sucked into the pull starter

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.650 
getting sucked into the pull starter
area<00:07:28.020> the<00:07:29.020> deck<00:07:29.230> where's<00:07:29.590> our<00:07:29.740> Sweetwater

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
area the deck where's our Sweetwater

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:40.119 
area the deck where's our Sweetwater
one-for-one

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:40.129 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:45.549 

I<00:07:42.939> always<00:07:43.939> cut<00:07:44.330> my<00:07:44.479> grass<00:07:44.539> at<00:07:45.050> full<00:07:45.289> speed

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:45.559 
I always cut my grass at full speed

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.499 
I always cut my grass at full speed
because<00:07:45.770> that<00:07:46.129> makes<00:07:46.369> better<00:07:46.699> cutting<00:07:47.179> more

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:47.509 
because that makes better cutting more

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.659 
because that makes better cutting more
efficient<00:07:48.080> and<00:07:48.199> less<00:07:48.409> hacking<00:07:49.189> of<00:07:49.309> the<00:07:49.429> grass

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669 
efficient and less hacking of the grass

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.509 
efficient and less hacking of the grass
spits<00:07:50.179> it<00:07:50.300> out<00:07:50.389> better<00:07:50.629> too<00:07:51.159> so<00:07:52.159> that's<00:07:52.339> the

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:52.519 
spits it out better too so that's the

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:56.979 
spits it out better too so that's the
best<00:07:52.699> way<00:07:52.819> to<00:07:52.849> cut<00:07:53.059> grass<00:07:53.360> is<00:07:53.569> about<00:07:53.809> 3,500<00:07:54.649> rpm
