00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.820
 of bad faith then the conclusion that I 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.160
 I just arrived talking to some 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.869
 generals of the Brazilian army is that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.570
 they came to the conclusion that it was a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.390
 little hasty decision 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.730
 it's not because some are missing you create a 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.520
 law to protect a legend an ordinance 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.140
 in the case that impedes the life of almost 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.320
 everyone who is the pa 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.720
 now also recognize that the example the 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.930
 engine that most people 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.190
 find the CAC40 have an income from home 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.640
 I including the calling campaign 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.590
 Ben, do you think I was going through January? 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.710
 hand over their weapons to the government and 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.320
 bums thanks is what I was saying 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.809
 clearly if there passed in the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.149
 referendum is to win so I would have 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.520
 a soul went with me my personal 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.350
 continue but Mr 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.390
 is preaching that he fails to speak 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.700
 that's because my life is worth a lot 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 more cooperating paper can be sure 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 that our example brazil in sao paulo 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.860
 by the Brazilian championship 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.930
 understand what is happening and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.220
 change in this ordinance will now 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.380
 fair very good 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.510
 I hope it's the same population I 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.610
 I ask the question are you what to pm inside 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.430
 of the military police since his 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 Vote you do not want it now if you have good 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.110

 still you want military police inside 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.250
 it is that people speak and had the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.860
 there military intervention he misses 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.900
 of the values of that time was not a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 for the daughter the military period does not have 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.770
 government wonder place in a world but in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.189
 comparison with that crap that's there 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.900
 today, even if you buy it, you can 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.490
 examples of a general who have 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.520
 enriched competition in which 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.700
