a surf cochin I wouldn't wish it on my
worst<00:01:02.129> enemy<00:01:02.519> I<00:01:02.790> was<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> bed<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:04.320> next

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
worst enemy I was just in a bed our next

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
worst enemy I was just in a bed our next
to<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.009> toilet<00:01:05.190> for<00:01:06.180> 10<00:01:06.690> days<00:01:06.899> and<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.840> put<00:01:10.020> two

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to a toilet for 10 days and I put two

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
to a toilet for 10 days and I put two
and<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.380> together<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.670> do

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and two together right what do we all do

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.719 
and two together right what do we all do
we<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.710> there<00:01:13.710> anything<00:01:13.890> else<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.250> linters

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we also there anything else that linters

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
we also there anything else that linters
all<00:01:14.880> together<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.560> let's<00:01:16.950> look

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
all together not really so let's look

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:35.710 
all together not really so let's look
for<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:17.340> science<00:01:17.880> behind<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.780 

15<00:01:36.720> years<00:01:36.960> ago<00:01:37.080> water<00:01:37.440> companies<00:01:37.980> before<00:01:38.220> SAS

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
15 years ago water companies before SAS

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
15 years ago water companies before SAS
came<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.160> general<00:01:41.400> practice

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
came about it was the general practice

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
came about it was the general practice
you<00:01:42.210> pump<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.140> dump<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> sea

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you pump it and you dump it into the sea

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
you pump it and you dump it into the sea
and<00:01:44.370> that's<00:01:44.790> fine<00:01:45.060> governments<00:01:45.720> were<00:01:45.810> saying

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and that's fine governments were saying

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.140 
and that's fine governments were saying
that<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.260> okay<00:01:46.620> it<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.850> water

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
that was okay it was what water

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.090 
that was okay it was what water
companies<00:01:48.810> were<00:01:48.960> doing<00:01:49.230> all<00:01:49.470> across<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
companies were doing all across the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.220 
companies were doing all across the
board<00:01:50.130> across<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.730> country<00:01:51.120> when<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.020> read

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
board across the country when you read

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.170 
board across the country when you read
up<00:01:52.650> on<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> science<00:01:53.670> behind<00:01:53.820> there

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
up on some of the science behind there

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
up on some of the science behind there
and<00:01:54.330> find<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> things<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> third<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and find that the things like a third of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.250 
and find that the things like a third of
all<00:01:56.520> male<00:01:56.760> fish<00:01:57.150> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> UK<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:57.990> Annie<00:01:58.230> a

all male fish in the UK I'm Annie a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.460 
all male fish in the UK I'm Annie a
study<00:01:59.060> showing<00:02:00.060> female<00:02:00.660> trait<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.230> you<00:02:01.320> got

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
study showing female trait so you got

you put them in the sea they look just

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
you put them in the sea they look just
like<00:02:14.010> jellyfish<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.880> you've<00:02:15.570> got<00:02:15.810> dolphins

about the answer come on you need to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.429 
about the answer come on you need to
step<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.420> make<00:03:35.540> sure<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.870> can<00:03:36.019> do<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.200> as
