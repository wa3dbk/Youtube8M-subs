just kind of let it drape drape down and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.800 
just kind of let it drape drape down and
I<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> moved<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
I kind of moved it around to kind of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
I kind of moved it around to kind of
give<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.520> flowing<00:01:29.810> effect<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
give it that flowing effect so I kind of

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.899 
give it that flowing effect so I kind of
played<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
played with it a little bit and I got it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
played with it a little bit and I got it
to<00:01:36.350> finally<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> where<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
to finally when I got it to where I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
to finally when I got it to where I
wanted<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:38.880> left<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
wanted it I just left it like that to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
wanted it I just left it like that to
dry<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.799> easy<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
dry so it was actually really easy to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
dry so it was actually really easy to
make<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.140> again<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.470> hundred<00:01:46.799> percent

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
make and again it's a hundred percent

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
make and again it's a hundred percent
edible<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.899> me<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.320> definitely<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> plus

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
edible so to me that's definitely a plus

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
edible so to me that's definitely a plus
like<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:51.000> i'm<00:01:51.149> making<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.540> figure<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
like when you when i'm making a figure I

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
like when you when i'm making a figure I
like<00:01:52.229> everything<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.979> edible<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.759> course

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like everything to be edible of course

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
like everything to be edible of course
in<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.689> particular<00:01:54.930> figure<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.770> candle<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
in this particular figure the candle is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.069 
in this particular figure the candle is
not<00:01:56.460> edible<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.369> just<00:02:00.060> didn't<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> use

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
not edible but I just didn't want to use

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
not edible but I just didn't want to use
the<00:02:01.290> paper<00:02:01.500> cupcake<00:02:01.799> wrapper<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.340> thought<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the paper cupcake wrapper I thought I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760 
the paper cupcake wrapper I thought I
could<00:02:02.939> try<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.570> my<00:02:03.719> own<00:02:03.750> skirt<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
could try to make my own skirt and I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
could try to make my own skirt and I
think<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.100> turned<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:06.500> again

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
think it turned out pretty good again

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
think it turned out pretty good again
it's<00:02:07.680> only<00:02:07.979> my<00:02:08.099> first<00:02:08.129> try<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.629> not

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it's only my first try so it's not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's only my first try so it's not
perfect<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
perfect but it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.059 
perfect but it
definitely<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.069> good<00:02:12.340> first<00:02:12.579> attempt<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:14.069> as

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
definitely a good first attempt and as

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.690 
definitely a good first attempt and as
for<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.579> hair<00:02:15.909> what<00:02:16.629> i<00:02:16.659> did<00:02:16.900> was<00:02:17.170> i<00:02:17.620> used<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
for the hair what i did was i used a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.300 
for the hair what i did was i used a
fondant<00:02:19.569> extruder<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:21.340> extruded<00:02:23.310> long

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
fondant extruder and I extruded long

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.610 
fondant extruder and I extruded long
sausages<00:02:25.060> long<00:02:25.360> thin<00:02:25.629> sausages<00:02:26.170> out<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
sausages long thin sausages out of the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
sausages long thin sausages out of the
gum<00:02:26.799> paste<00:02:27.010> black<00:02:27.370> gum<00:02:27.579> paste<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.120> then<00:02:28.209> I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
gum paste black gum paste and then I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.530 
gum paste black gum paste and then I
wrapped<00:02:29.409> each<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.459> those<00:02:30.579> sausages<00:02:31.090> around<00:02:31.150> a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
wrapped each of those sausages around a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.179 
wrapped each of those sausages around a
toothpick<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.109> give<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.500> spiral<00:02:32.950> curl

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
toothpick to give at the spiral curl

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.170 
toothpick to give at the spiral curl
effect<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:35.829> know<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.129> was<00:02:36.280> actually<00:02:36.579> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
effect you know this was actually a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.530 
effect you know this was actually a
premade<00:02:38.069> fondant<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.849> don't<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.269> if<00:02:40.420> it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
premade fondant and I don't know if it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.509 
premade fondant and I don't know if it
was<00:02:40.689> because<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.109> was<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.409> black<00:02:41.650> fondant<00:02:42.099> or

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
was because it was the black fondant or

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.399 
was because it was the black fondant or
or<00:02:42.970> maybe<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.450> particular<00:02:43.930> brand<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.349> I

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
or maybe the particular brand that I

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.270 
or maybe the particular brand that I
used<00:02:44.709> but<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:45.940> really<00:02:46.450> brittle<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
used but it was really brittle and it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.729 
used but it was really brittle and it
was<00:02:48.730> actually<00:02:49.150> very<00:02:49.180> crumbly<00:02:50.049> as<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.409> started

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
was actually very crumbly as it started

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.910 
was actually very crumbly as it started
drying<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.659> see<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.930> had<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.379> little<00:02:53.709> bit

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
drying so you can see I had a little bit

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.119 
drying so you can see I had a little bit
of<00:02:54.069> trouble<00:02:54.519> getting<00:02:55.379> some<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.560> pieces<00:02:56.739> to

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
of trouble getting some of the pieces to

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.339 
of trouble getting some of the pieces to
stay<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.810> I<00:03:00.510> don't<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.629> again<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.230> was

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
stay on so I don't know again if it was

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.229 
stay on so I don't know again if it was
because<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.769> was<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.069> black<00:03:03.280> or<00:03:03.700> because<00:03:04.120> it

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
because it was the black or because it

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.539 
because it was the black or because it
was<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.480> brand<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.930> use<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:05.530> if<00:03:06.250> you're

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
was the brand that I use but if you're

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.339 
was the brand that I use but if you're
going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> use<00:03:06.909> black<00:03:07.269> fondant<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.870> make<00:03:08.049> care

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
going to use black fondant to make care

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.740 
going to use black fondant to make care
like<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.040> just<00:03:09.579> keep<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.090> mind<00:03:10.389> that<00:03:10.629> it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
like this just keep that in mind that it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.780 
like this just keep that in mind that it
could<00:03:10.959> get<00:03:11.109> brittle<00:03:11.439> as<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.680> dries<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.650> I

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
could get brittle as it dries so I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.330 
could get brittle as it dries so I
actually<00:03:15.790> also<00:03:16.349> got<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.470> idea<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:17.889> add<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually also got the idea to add the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.360 
actually also got the idea to add the
candle<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:20.049> figure<00:03:20.319> just<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.040> kind<00:03:21.280> of

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
candle to this figure just to kind of

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.539 
candle to this figure just to kind of
make<00:03:21.549> her<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.120> little<00:03:22.359> bit<00:03:22.540> different<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.549> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
make her a little bit different and that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.210 
make her a little bit different and that
way<00:03:24.669> she'll<00:03:24.940> double<00:03:25.299> as<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:26.079> candle<00:03:26.889> on<00:03:27.129> top

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
way she'll double as the candle on top

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.409 
way she'll double as the candle on top
of<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.299> cake<00:03:28.510> as<00:03:28.720> well<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> what<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.060> did<00:03:31.269> for

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
of the cake as well so what I did for

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.020 
of the cake as well so what I did for
the<00:03:31.510> candle<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.980> candles<00:03:33.400> actually

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the candle is the candles actually

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.250 
the candle is the candles actually
embedded<00:03:34.690> into<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:36.159> part<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.909> skirt

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
embedded into the this part of the skirt

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.699 
embedded into the this part of the skirt
I<00:03:38.260> kind<00:03:38.859> of<00:03:38.980> made<00:03:39.879> like<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> hole<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
I kind of made like a hole that's the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.830 
I kind of made like a hole that's the
same<00:03:41.979> size<00:03:42.250> as<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.489> candle<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.299> put<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.720> in

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
same size as the candle and I put it in

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.159 
same size as the candle and I put it in
the<00:03:43.930> hole<00:03:44.109> but<00:03:44.829> then<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.599> made<00:03:46.599> sure<00:03:46.629> that<00:03:46.989> her

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
the hole but then I made sure that her

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.990 
the hole but then I made sure that her
hand<00:03:47.500> was<00:03:47.709> touching<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.220> candle<00:03:48.609> just<00:03:48.790> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
hand was touching the candle just to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.819 
hand was touching the candle just to
kind<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.780> give<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.049> illusion<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.500> she's

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
kind of give the illusion that she's

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.469 
kind of give the illusion that she's
holding<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.280> candle<00:03:51.489> herself<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.299> she's

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
holding the candle herself but she's

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.229 
holding the candle herself but she's
actually<00:03:52.659> not<00:03:53.049> its<00:03:53.319> resting<00:03:53.799> inside<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:55.030> hole

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
actually not its resting inside the hole

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.500 
actually not its resting inside the hole
in<00:03:55.449> the<00:03:55.569> skirt<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.909> there<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.989> go<00:04:00.120> again<00:04:01.120> she's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
in the skirt so there you go again she's

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.539 
in the skirt so there you go again she's
my<00:04:01.659> second<00:04:02.079> attempt<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.919> not<00:04:03.069> used<00:04:03.280> any

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
my second attempt I have not used any

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.180 
my second attempt I have not used any
tutorials<00:04:04.269> for<00:04:05.049> either<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.530> my<00:04:05.680> gumpaste

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
tutorials for either of my gumpaste

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.670 
tutorials for either of my gumpaste
figures<00:04:06.639> and<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.810> know<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.260> there<00:04:08.379> are<00:04:08.440> some

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
figures and I know that there are some

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.789 
figures and I know that there are some
really<00:04:08.859> good<00:04:09.129> tutorials<00:04:09.729> out<00:04:09.879> there<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:11.139> I

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
really good tutorials out there and I

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.289 
really good tutorials out there and I
was<00:04:11.979> actually<00:04:12.129> prepared<00:04:12.669> to<00:04:12.790> go<00:04:12.909> ahead<00:04:13.000> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
was actually prepared to go ahead and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.210 
was actually prepared to go ahead and
purchase<00:04:13.449> them<00:04:13.900> but<00:04:14.530> i<00:04:14.560> thought<00:04:14.799> i<00:04:14.859> would<00:04:15.099> give
