00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
stock level and I do have a gyro in here

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.740 
stock level and I do have a gyro in here
for<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.110> application<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:08.429> makes<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> lot

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
for this application it makes it a lot

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
for this application it makes it a lot
easier<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.200> drive<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.709> makes<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> lot<00:02:11.160> easier

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
easier to drive it makes it a lot easier

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.580 
easier to drive it makes it a lot easier
to<00:02:11.580> trip<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.209> able<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
to trip and be able to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.970 
to trip and be able to
show<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.379> back<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.769> get<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
show it and then in the back I get a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.570 
show it and then in the back I get a
all-aluminum<00:02:16.849> gearbox<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:18.620> really<00:02:19.220> awesome

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
all-aluminum gearbox it's really awesome

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.540 
all-aluminum gearbox it's really awesome
because<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.030> helps<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.390> cool<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.840> motor<00:02:20.989> uh

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
because it helps to cool the motor uh

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.460 
because it helps to cool the motor uh
really<00:02:22.550> really<00:02:22.940> well<00:02:23.150> unlike<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> stop<00:02:24.170> motor

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
really really well unlike the stop motor

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.190 
really really well unlike the stop motor
it<00:02:24.830> gets<00:02:25.129> luck<00:02:25.459> well<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.000> got<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> because<00:02:26.540> when

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
it gets luck well I got it because when

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.570 
it gets luck well I got it because when
I<00:02:27.230> had<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.590> stop<00:02:27.800> motor<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.220> there<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
I had to stop motor in there it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.479 
I had to stop motor in there it
overheats<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.450> time<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.349> this<00:02:31.069> was

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
overheats all the time and and this was

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.490 
overheats all the time and and this was
the<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.150> solution<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.660> fixing<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.349> ever

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the the solution to fixing it but ever

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.580 
the the solution to fixing it but ever
since<00:02:33.680> then<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.980> upgraded<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.730> Viper<00:02:35.590> 4000

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
since then I upgraded to the Viper 4000

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.850 
since then I upgraded to the Viper 4000
kV<00:02:37.060> 120<00:02:38.060> amp<00:02:38.209> combo<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> lot<00:02:39.650> more

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
kV 120 amp combo I like it a lot more

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.589 
kV 120 amp combo I like it a lot more
better<00:02:40.010> than<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> stock<00:02:40.489> system<00:02:40.730> because

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
better than the stock system because

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.750 
better than the stock system because
it's<00:02:41.780> got<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> lot<00:02:42.110> more<00:02:42.290> torque<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.830> actually

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
it's got a lot more torque and actually

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.670 
it's got a lot more torque and actually
for<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:43.940> same<00:02:44.150> pack<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.540> battery<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.319> got<00:02:45.500> more

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
for the same pack of battery it got more

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.870 
for the same pack of battery it got more
torque<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.390> more<00:02:47.390> runtime<00:02:47.840> as<00:02:48.019> well<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:49.760> you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
torque in more runtime as well so if you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.970 
torque in more runtime as well so if you
move<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.269> back<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.930> got<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.380> same<00:02:51.650> heart

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
move to the back we got the same heart

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.940 
move to the back we got the same heart
racing<00:02:52.250> big<00:02:52.430> fours<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> back<00:02:53.290> all<00:02:54.290> around

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
racing big fours in the back all around

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.059 
racing big fours in the back all around
get<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.489> thick<00:02:55.790> sway<00:02:56.090> bar<00:02:56.299> kit<00:02:56.329> and<00:02:57.170> there's<00:02:58.010> a

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
get a thick sway bar kit and there's a

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.420 
get a thick sway bar kit and there's a
lot<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.370> lumen<00:02:58.700> 'm<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.480> comes<00:02:59.750> with<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
lot of lumen 'm that comes with the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.520 
lot of lumen 'm that comes with the
motor<00:03:01.430> chassis<00:03:01.879> from<00:03:02.150> from<00:03:02.540> Chuck's<00:03:02.870> works<00:03:03.110> RC

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
motor chassis from from Chuck's works RC

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.640 
motor chassis from from Chuck's works RC
so<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.000> lot<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.629> I<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.500> for

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
so I like it a lot so I have it for

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.039 
so I like it a lot so I have it for

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
time to time I bring it out just to

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.520 
time to time I bring it out just to
drive<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.329> I'm<00:03:11.629> really<00:03:11.780> loving<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.260> truck

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
so today I'm just gonna run it for a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.599 
so today I'm just gonna run it for a
little<00:03:15.230> bit<00:03:15.319> here<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:16.220> hope<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.519> guys
