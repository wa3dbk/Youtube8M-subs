very small portion of the game logic ie
the<00:02:09.000> scoring<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.989> game<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.709> running<00:02:11.550> on

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the scoring in game actually running on

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.340 
the scoring in game actually running on
the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.610 
the
mission<00:02:12.590> master<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.790> playstation<00:02:14.720> 4<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
mission master one playstation 4 and the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.380 
mission master one playstation 4 and the
game<00:02:16.000> selected<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.810> its<00:02:18.110> connection<00:02:18.980> quality

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
game selected for its connection quality

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.210 
game selected for its connection quality
so<00:02:20.390> i<00:02:20.420> don't<00:02:20.660> know<00:02:20.810> how<00:02:20.990> everybody<00:02:21.560> else<00:02:21.770> read

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so i don't know how everybody else read

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.450 
so i don't know how everybody else read
it<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.550> way<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> read<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.690> that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
it but the way I read it is that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.920 
it but the way I read it is that
everything<00:02:25.460> happens<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.940> your<00:02:26.090> playstation<00:02:26.720> 4

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
everything happens on your playstation 4

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.620 
everything happens on your playstation 4
with<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:27.650> playstation<00:02:28.370> 4<00:02:28.580> being<00:02:28.850> selected<00:02:29.510> as

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
with one playstation 4 being selected as

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.380 
with one playstation 4 being selected as
the<00:02:29.830> top<00:02:30.830> one<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.850> its<00:02:31.970> connection

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
the top one because of its connection

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750 
the top one because of its connection
quality<00:02:32.570> now<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.590> doesn't<00:02:33.980> sound<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.370> this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
quality now it doesn't sound like this

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.840 
quality now it doesn't sound like this
is<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.330> strict<00:02:36.140> peer-to-peer<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.610> it's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
is a strict peer-to-peer so it's it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.820 
is a strict peer-to-peer so it's it's
technically<00:02:38.570> not<00:02:38.720> correct<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.320> call<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.740> a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
technically not correct to call it a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.400 
technically not correct to call it a
peer-to-peer<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.660> far<00:02:41.930> as<00:02:41.990> dedicated

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
peer-to-peer but as far as dedicated

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.010 
peer-to-peer but as far as dedicated
servers<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> way<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.580> gamers<00:02:44.120> usually

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
servers in the way that gamers usually

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.290 
servers in the way that gamers usually
talk<00:02:45.260> about<00:02:45.290> dedicated<00:02:46.100> servers<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:47.060> does

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
talk about dedicated servers this does

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.710 
talk about dedicated servers this does
not<00:02:47.330> appear<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.380> be<00:02:48.410> truly<00:02:49.250> dedicated<00:02:49.970> servers

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
not appear to be truly dedicated servers

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.930 
not appear to be truly dedicated servers
in<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.170> most<00:02:51.410> people<00:02:51.860> talk<00:02:52.070> about

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
in the way that most people talk about

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.880 
in the way that most people talk about
them<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.240> looks<00:02:53.480> more<00:02:53.690> like<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.110> hybrid<00:02:54.500> of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
them this looks more like a hybrid of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.550 
them this looks more like a hybrid of
sorts<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.600> game<00:02:56.810> continues<00:02:57.380> like

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
sorts so that your game continues like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.670 
sorts so that your game continues like
even<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.070> host<00:02:58.250> drops<00:02:58.640> out<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
even if the host drops out of the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.980 
even if the host drops out of the
dedicated<00:03:00.680> quote<00:03:01.280> server<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.660> talking

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
dedicated quote server that it's talking

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.140 
dedicated quote server that it's talking
to<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.590> will<00:03:03.920> then<00:03:04.100> switch<00:03:04.460> around<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.970> pick

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
to it will then switch around and pick

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.180 
to it will then switch around and pick
somebody<00:03:05.450> else<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.800> don't<00:03:06.980> lose

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
somebody else so that you don't lose

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.340 
somebody else so that you don't lose
connection<00:03:07.640> with<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.030> game<00:03:08.240> so<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.140> seems

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
connection with the game so this seems

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.830 
connection with the game so this seems
to<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.620> more<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> hybrid<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:11.720> mean

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
to be more like a hybrid and I mean

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.510 
to be more like a hybrid and I mean
that's<00:03:11.960> not<00:03:12.170> necessarily<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.890> bad<00:03:13.070> thing<00:03:13.130> they

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
that's not necessarily a bad thing they

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.790 
that's not necessarily a bad thing they
claim<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.060> devs<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:15.020> they've<00:03:15.500> pretty

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
claim the devs do that they've pretty

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.530 
claim the devs do that they've pretty
much<00:03:15.890> worked<00:03:16.340> out<00:03:16.520> all<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.790> lag<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.330> said

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
much worked out all the lag they said

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.170 
much worked out all the lag they said
that<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.960> really<00:03:18.430> clean<00:03:19.430> experience

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that it's a really clean experience

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.990 
that it's a really clean experience
online<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.200> know<00:03:21.500> if<00:03:22.160> it<00:03:22.400> works<00:03:22.700> that's

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
online so you know if it works that's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.390 
online so you know if it works that's
all<00:03:23.240> that<00:03:23.420> matters<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.960> end<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:24.620> before<00:03:25.250> I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
all that matters in the end and before I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.100 
all that matters in the end and before I
did<00:03:25.580> this<00:03:25.670> video<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.000> tried<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.630> do<00:03:26.900> some

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
did this video I tried to do some

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.780 
did this video I tried to do some
research<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.680> see<00:03:27.710> if<00:03:27.860> anybody<00:03:28.340> else<00:03:28.520> was

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
research to see if anybody else was

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.550 
research to see if anybody else was
reporting<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.870> actually<00:03:30.290> saying

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
reporting what this is actually saying

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.770 
reporting what this is actually saying
and<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.580> only<00:03:31.730> people<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.300> could<00:03:32.510> find

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and the only people that I could find

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.080 
and the only people that I could find
out<00:03:32.960> who<00:03:33.230> really<00:03:33.500> seemed<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.490> read<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
out who really seemed to have read the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.810 
out who really seemed to have read the
same<00:03:35.300> article<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> read<00:03:36.320> they<00:03:37.310> were<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
same article that I read they were the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.540 
same article that I read they were the
actual<00:03:38.030> killzone<00:03:38.960> community<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.800> if<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.370> go

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.190 
actual killzone community and if you go
in<00:03:40.760> there<00:03:40.940> there's<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.240> lot<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.450> threads<00:03:41.810> where

in there there's a lot of threads where
a<00:03:42.530> lot<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.070> hardcore<00:03:43.760> gamers<00:03:44.180> at<00:03:44.360> least

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
a lot of the hardcore gamers at least

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.480 
a lot of the hardcore gamers at least
are<00:03:45.230> complaining<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:45.800> they<00:03:46.040> usually<00:03:46.370> do

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
are complaining because they usually do

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.820 
are complaining because they usually do
clan<00:03:46.820> matches<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.510> course<00:03:47.690> they<00:03:47.990> want<00:03:48.230> the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
clan matches so of course they want the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.520 
clan matches so of course they want the
optimal<00:03:49.460> best<00:03:50.240> connection<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.350> can
