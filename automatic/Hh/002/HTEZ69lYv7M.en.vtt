00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the bar of the is also cold here 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.309
 hunger is dying frozen 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.730
 look at the chills mom as they are 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 nice the only way to get off is the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 leap of faith is activated bring me 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.750
 luck I did to the blues 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.480
 I'm pieces today I'm here for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.210
 to present you a new fashion the fashion of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.180
 today it is the free runners mod 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.550
 we start immediately usually I always have 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.010
 made fashions that introduced 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 news at the single player level but 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 let's say in the single player world then 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.460
 in playability 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 I do not know well the new new items 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 functions here now but I wanted to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.670
 review for you a mod that goes to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 modify useful aspects for 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 kustom map in parkour can be 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.570
 logically used also in the world 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.699
 single player normal and that's fine but 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.640
 I think this fashion introduced in 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.119
 some parkour maps really is 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 fantastic 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.650
 in a nutshell adds us the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 possibility of attacking us at the limit of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.560
 block 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 you know how to do in assassin's 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.549
 creed iii mirror and I still have all 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.590
 those parkour games where when there 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.170
 we launch we hold on to the block and then 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 we go up here this function comes 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.030
 introduced by fashion ok 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 there are many other fashions that they do 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.439
 this function for example the smart 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 moving is a different thing because with 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 this mode can also be skipped 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 backwards 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.020
 therefore it is a junta more than unfortunately 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.909
 the smart moving probably has not vi 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 I will also show the smart moving visa 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.200
 that many have asked me this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.500
 fashion how it works is a lot of fashion 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.290
 short but also very simple there 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.159
 introduces these three objects are the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 wedge stone age and ice tac with 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.750
 this you do stack that we would say the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.920
 straw block allows us not to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 take fall damage is practically 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.479
 let's call them in a simple way from i 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.729
 blocks of straw 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.580
 this is the fashion of assassin's creed 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.769
 just referred to written assisi 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.360
 let's just say big quotes 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.310
 like a house I show you which 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.860
 you will have to suffer blue funnel damage in the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.140
 block of italy and as you see it acts as 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.989
 spider web does not harm me 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.540
 ok so this is the specific function 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.330
 the stack then there are these 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.640
 blocks where we should do maybe 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.110
 of the very high jumps then we have 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.329
 so two objects I told you wood e 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 nagel stonehenge are blocks 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.989
 decorative then you will find them in the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.549
 decorative section and as you see not 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.540
 clash even that much with 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.430
 the environment 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.470
 probably would have been better 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 introduce a variant of this color 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.790
 because it looks more like i rom ok 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.019
 however it makes no difference 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.819
 I'll show you how it works then 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.890
 here and should have put a grate ok 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.970
 by pressing control you can set 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.030
 anyway all the keys here ok control 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.829
 I mean ctrl which would be the rate of the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.359
 automatic sprint because the sprint 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.120
 double is done with the automatic v 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.049
 it is done with the control and with this key 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.660
 control 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.419
 we can also say stick to it 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.359
 all look I climb the wall I press of 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.430
 new against and now the climb ok you have 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.319
 understood it works so I could too 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.940
 do it without having in mind the race on 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.010
 wall here look I make a short one 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.239
 run on the wall and then they can too 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.190
 throwing me back I will show you 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.780
 as a nanny so much 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.910
 have you seen I launched all 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.560
 back then this is the function 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.669
 main I show you how to get on 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.700
 to which we must take the times well 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.000
 no we were too high I have to do it here 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.099
 we do it go 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.730
 ok still control goes again control not 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.200
 I can get damn better I have to 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.359
 hold on here 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.669
 okay give us what we can do from not 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.139
 you can not go up no I would need a 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.720
 another damn block because this 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:09.739
 custom maps is done in another way 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.580
 so to do it exactly perfect ok 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.010
 maybe he did n't 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.820
 zero 1 should put two 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.110
 blocks 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:22.250
 ok so you can skip it look 0 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.680
 come here the line no I have to take good 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.630
 times 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.090
 ok ok okay shame salts not 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.870
 I can only jolie an incapable and too much 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.430
 hard 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.290
 I have absolutely not in the past this 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.410
 obstacle with the creative because they are not 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.570
 really good in parkour lopez no 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.970
 let's go ahead and see how it becomes or 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.220
 here it is said that we can resort to the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.890
 wall and it's true look we care 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.360
 towards the wall control and as you see now 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.310
 we managed to get there 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.820
 as always, however, this map is missing 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 the blocks know this ok so us 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.910
 we can't go up 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.770
 damn stuck no me 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.300
 forgot to show you the last one 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 object introduced by the fashion that is the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.390
 climbing love that practically there 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.910
 allows you to climb over the block 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.460
 automatically almost automatically ed 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.160
 it's very, very beautiful, it's a little slow 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.130
 I must say, however, it is really well done 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.380
 it makes no sense let's say I was split 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.650
 because I want to exit is now active 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.840
 the flai ok perfect I had to disconnect 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.370
 activate it because you go up with against 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.950
 space ok 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.230
 this was today's fad is a fashion 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.669
 very fast simple so i will put you 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.140
 definitely a video 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.600
 but since many have asked me 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.280
 of fashions has alternatives and what not 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.260
 always introduced the same things I have 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.550
 decided to bring you a fashion that could 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.740
 introduce a little more 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.770
 fun to use 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.500
 however it is the fantastic model you try 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.810
 you find the link in the description vi 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.550
 I invite advice indeed as always 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.530
 launch a good live that arrived at 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.060
 thousand will publish a new fashion 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.990
 subscribe to the channel if you don't already have it 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.300
 done and we do n't want in a neighbor 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.300
 video from patches all hello to everyone
