00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.279
 we started the fourth clinic of the month with the lutier marcelo leite obama soon 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.899
 al in this by de marcelo 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.059
 there 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.900
 different format dictate them and is that they do not see the business not the nolan day itself 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.810
 one goes and a lot of pictures of ETA members and that's why the characteristics 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 fundamentals that have the appointment starts with its format 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.009
 very good question steal 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.869
 ee 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.169
 basically 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.270
 percent there are two big trends that are the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.930
 par excellence the sounds time 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.350
 this one has to do 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100
 yes, it is offered by a guitar 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.480
 which contains a configuration of three simple microphones 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.940
 with a certain one under construction 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.370
 yes on the part of the command and the body 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.929
 i obviously 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.230
 is a determining factor when talking about sound 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.720
 the types of woods used in the instrument 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.990
 percent and we also have on the other hand a lottery a type instrument les 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.469
 paul 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.859
 without living only on brands 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:02.890
 of x 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 What do they offer us? 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800
 a sound 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.190
 the totally opposed what would be the one of a statute until then is thus 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460
 that we could deal with two major trends 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.680
 Sound 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.820
 but also a good reference of that club 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.229
 efe the artist that we like that we like 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 and that therefore in osorno the ear is sweetened with a characteristic sound 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 if we speak for example of eric clapton and we can not stop thinking about a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.109
 internal 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.130
 with this type of configuration 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.560
 just like we did talk about the pink floyd guitarist also 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.400
 we have to inevitably think of nothing and tarra this guy 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.760
 However 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.980
 by heaven 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.510
 oo we hear the guitarist of Iran are robberies 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.010
 and we will never see tarragona and vine of this type 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.520
 or the lead guitarist zeppelin percent 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.390
 we are not going to see it fight well with our destiny 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 we're going to see him play we'll hear him 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 no more with all the sound 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.020
 reads from today's microphone and nothing else or with more body 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.680
 then those would be the two major trends after an envelope of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.849
 diferent models 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.449
 there a kind of pocket before 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.109
 about super extra models 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.169
 that come equipped with sources that do not offer us stability in 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.379
 financing issue 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 yes to use the lever with more freedom 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.150
 in which it was agreed with another configuration in the equipment 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.559
 electronic 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.250
 per hundred with other availability in matters of comfort for 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.250
 a matter of in him as she in the mango and zara sada are more specific 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 for certain genres and certain musical styles 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.189
 valued marcelo omen there is a lot of variety you have to ask for advice 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.540
 with bravos in the 1st 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.210
 a block that we have made for the clinic so we do not find them in the 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.190
 next edition of the oscar guitar parts is that it seems very well 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.280
 lots of grace rob
