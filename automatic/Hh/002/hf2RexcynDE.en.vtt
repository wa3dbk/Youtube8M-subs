00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.189 
ridges like the regular food bag ridges
has<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.300> heat<00:00:42.300> seal<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.740 

all<00:00:51.010> right<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.280> when<00:00:51.850> you're<00:00:52.059> making<00:00:52.359> your

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
all right so when you're making your

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.099 
all right so when you're making your
your<00:00:53.760> FoodSaver<00:00:54.760> bag<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.600> want<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.839> just<00:00:56.019> you

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
your FoodSaver bag you want to just you

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.450 
your FoodSaver bag you want to just you
can<00:00:56.260> leave<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.469> sandwich<00:00:56.620> bag<00:00:56.949> over<00:00:57.159> the<00:00:57.250> top

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
can leave the sandwich bag over the top

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.040 
can leave the sandwich bag over the top
and<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:57.730> want<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.000> make<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.659> know<00:00:58.750> cut<00:00:59.019> it

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
and you want to make it you know cut it

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.020 
and you want to make it you know cut it
generously<00:00:59.440> because<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.789> will

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
generously because you you will

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.969 
generously because you you will
rehydrate<00:01:01.449> your<00:01:01.809> meal<00:01:01.989> inside<00:01:02.289> that<00:01:02.530> bag<00:01:02.739> and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
rehydrate your meal inside that bag and

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.139 
rehydrate your meal inside that bag and
you<00:01:03.100> want<00:01:03.219> to<00:01:03.280> have<00:01:03.370> enough<00:01:03.550> room<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.729> seal<00:01:04.000> it

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
you want to have enough room to seal it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.570 
you want to have enough room to seal it
so<00:01:04.930> I<00:01:05.500> usually<00:01:05.680> cut<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.130> right<00:01:06.369> around<00:01:06.549> there

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so I usually cut it right around there

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.690 
so I usually cut it right around there
and<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.799> end<00:01:11.890> up<00:01:11.950> with<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.100> bag<00:01:12.399> that's

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
and so you end up with a bag that's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.609 
and so you end up with a bag that's
probably<00:01:13.060> twinges<00:01:14.020> longer<00:01:14.409> than<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
probably twinges longer than the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.340 
probably twinges longer than the
original<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:15.759> you're<00:01:16.060> going<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.630> heat<00:01:17.049> seal

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
original and you're going to heat seal

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:38.000 
original and you're going to heat seal
the<00:01:17.619> base<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.550 

get<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.040> seal<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.700> now<00:01:40.170> prop<00:01:41.170> open<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
get a seal on there now prop open the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.460 
get a seal on there now prop open the

to actually rehydrate the meal in and
line<00:02:02.500> it<00:02:02.649> up

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.480 

all<00:02:29.770> right

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
all right

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.530 
all right
these<00:02:31.060> your<00:02:31.330> five<00:02:31.780> ounce<00:02:32.050> portion<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.980> Chile

the<00:02:34.540> napkin<00:02:35.050> allows<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.430> double<00:02:36.850> bag<00:02:37.180> it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
the napkin allows you to double bag it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.440 
the napkin allows you to double bag it
so<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.490> dry<00:02:39.490> chili<00:02:39.820> doesn't<00:02:40.000> penetrate

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so that the dry chili doesn't penetrate

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.320 
so that the dry chili doesn't penetrate
the<00:02:40.960> bag<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.860> had<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> few<00:02:42.340> issues<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:43.030> year

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the bag we had a few issues this year

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.660 
the bag we had a few issues this year
with<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> Chile<00:02:44.530> pain<00:02:44.830> penetrated<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.520> bag

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
with the Chile pain penetrated the bag

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.610 
with the Chile pain penetrated the bag
or<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> ground<00:02:46.180> beef<00:02:46.420> penetrate<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.470> bag

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
or the ground beef penetrate in the bag

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.800 
or the ground beef penetrate in the bag
so<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:50.350> had<00:02:50.740> seen<00:02:51.130> one<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.180> Babel<00:02:52.450> Fish<00:02:52.480> fives

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
so we had seen one of Babel Fish fives

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.290 
so we had seen one of Babel Fish fives
videos<00:02:53.230> where<00:02:53.470> he<00:02:53.500> actually<00:02:54.210> uses<00:02:55.210> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
videos where he actually uses this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.880 
videos where he actually uses this
method<00:02:55.690> uses<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.020> napkin<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.530> slides<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.800> in
