these symbols are both new set of drums

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.330 
these symbols are both new set of drums
of<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.960> treated<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> vibration<00:00:35.070> damper

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
of one treated with a vibration damper

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880 
of one treated with a vibration damper
the<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.850> treated<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.680> these<00:00:37.680> are

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the other not treated at all these are

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.319 
the other not treated at all these are
tuned<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> musical<00:00:38.700> frequencies<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> are

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tuned to musical frequencies that are

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.229 
tuned to musical frequencies that are
pleasant<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> ear<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.469> hit<00:00:40.590> one

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
pleasant to the ear so when you hit one

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.430 
pleasant to the ear so when you hit one
sounds<00:00:42.239> Pleasant<00:00:42.660> much<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> wind<00:00:43.260> chime

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sounds Pleasant much like a wind chime

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
sounds Pleasant much like a wind chime
in<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.010> car<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.670> panels<00:00:45.030> are<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> any

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
in your car the panels are not to any

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
in your car the panels are not to any
specific<00:00:46.010> frequency<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.789> don't<00:00:47.969> hear

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
specific frequency so you don't hear

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.610 
specific frequency so you don't hear
something<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.570> sounds<00:00:48.960> nice<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.440> end

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
something that sounds nice but you end

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
something that sounds nice but you end
up<00:00:49.710> hearing<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> road<00:00:50.460> noise<00:00:50.719> engine

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
up hearing of the road noise engine

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
up hearing of the road noise engine
noise<00:00:51.750> exhaust<00:00:52.379> things<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.579> if

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
noise exhaust things like that well if

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
noise exhaust things like that well if
you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.850> convert<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> vibrations<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you can convert the vibrations in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
you can convert the vibrations in the
heat<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.710> eliminate<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> vibrations

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
heat you can eliminate the vibrations

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
heat you can eliminate the vibrations
you<00:00:57.270> eliminate<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.719> majority<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.340> noise

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you eliminate the majority of the noise

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.990 
you eliminate the majority of the noise
so<00:01:00.390> here's<00:01:00.600> again<00:01:00.870> cymbal<00:01:01.879> sounds<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
so here's again cymbal sounds like a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.399 
so here's again cymbal sounds like a
regular<00:01:03.210> simple<00:01:03.690> no<00:01:03.840> matter<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
regular simple no matter what we do to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
regular simple no matter what we do to
this<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.119> dead<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> dead

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this one it's just dead it's just a dead

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
this one it's just dead it's just a dead
sound<00:01:07.619> Anthony<00:01:08.549> damp<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.540> fire<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.350> your

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
sound Anthony damp will fire and your

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
sound Anthony damp will fire and your
heat<00:01:10.740> map<00:01:11.000> tell<00:01:12.000> us<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.210> control<00:01:12.600> part<00:01:12.750> this

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
heat map tell us about control part this

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
heat map tell us about control part this
is<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> damping<00:01:13.439> fire<00:01:13.710> product<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.369> penis

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
is the damping fire product it's a penis

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
is the damping fire product it's a penis
stick<00:01:15.000> mat<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> converts<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.280> vibrations

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
stick mat that converts the vibrations

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
stick mat that converts the vibrations
into<00:01:17.490> heat<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.229> spectrum

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
into heat just like just like spectrum

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
into heat just like just like spectrum
here<00:01:19.860> doesn't<00:01:20.159> links<00:01:20.369> feeling<00:01:20.759> stick<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here doesn't links feeling stick so you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.460 
here doesn't links feeling stick so you
don't<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> spray<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.840> here's<00:01:22.380> your

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
don't have to spray it here's your

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
don't have to spray it here's your
typical<00:01:22.799> piece<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> aluminum<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
typical piece of aluminum we're going to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
typical piece of aluminum we're going to
drop<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.900> ground<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.409> going

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
drop this on the ground and we're going

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.450 
drop this on the ground and we're going
to<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> sounds<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:28.250> pretty<00:01:29.250> good

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
to see what it sounds like pretty good

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.149 
to see what it sounds like pretty good
display<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.810> we're<00:01:31.799> gonna<00:01:31.890> put

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
display right there now we're gonna put

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.530 
display right there now we're gonna put
a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> vibration<00:01:32.670> met<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
a little bit of vibration met on it this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.679 
a little bit of vibration met on it this
is<00:01:33.720> damp<00:01:33.960> afire<00:01:35.390> doesn't<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> hundred

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is damp afire doesn't have a hundred

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.420 
is damp afire doesn't have a hundred
percent<00:01:36.840> coverage<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.470> you'll<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.070> able<00:01:38.220> to
