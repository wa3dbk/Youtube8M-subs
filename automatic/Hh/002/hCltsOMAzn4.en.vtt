 we yes not the median segment of freckles has been renewed in the latter 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 12 months as it had rarely done in our country before 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.080
 that his generation was stranded as was the way to insert those that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.700
 they appeared for the first time that I had in the market as the stock market has indicated 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.130
 that if we need to approve a product that but appeared earlier this month 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.520
 from 2010 I am speaking p the new miss san frontis 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.090
 this product that reaches the importer of thailand does it with a needle marta 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.660
 quite to the side if we compare it with what its competitors arrived 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.060
 with a single engine version and also with a single level of 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.710
 equipment 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.590
 is what it has to do with the price lara canyon forty-one thousand 200 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.930
 dollars fig to 44 thousand 500 of the most equipped version seat with 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.850
 leather upholstery and well-equipped automatic box with a turbo diesel engine 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 of 2 thousand 500 cubic centimeters an engine of his life in the average of this 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.110
 segment since we have 2 liter engines with double turbo like that of the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.680
 tic to pamarot up to the three liter engines of the high end you are the one 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.740
 is in the average is fed up with this segment what has in the greatest 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.730
 power of its category this new nissan frontier this in cordoba the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
 172 horsepower engine 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 the average consumption in the city gave us in the order of 15 liters per 100 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.190
 kilometers let's say it is within the average of what we can expect from 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.580
 this engine and you also have to keep in mind that the course of the box 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.950
 automatic always 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.160
 go to a conflict the consumption values â€‹â€‹the mechanical part is completed with the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.380
 double traction system a conventional manual drive system 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.690
 electronic not the electronic couplings but the driver is the one 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.010
 decides when to attach the noble traction has double high that 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.480
 You can place with the vehicle in motion and also have low doublet 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.490
 for which the vehicle has to be 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.970
 obviously it was detected that it has to do with the behavior observed in the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.700
 case the frontier has the longest wheelbase of that time are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.860
 three thousand 200 millimeters pietro I'm going to lie with a body height 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.000
 that is not the highest either so the behavior roof robbed in 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 this west sense a little bit more penalized 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.020
 it has effects of course with the safety comfort but not all that 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.150
 we could extend in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.890
 a vehicle this price between the missing ones annotated for example you do not have 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.950
 a on-board computer notimex automatic central locking 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.750
 filming one has that the accuser automates saying we're talking about 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.750
 missing ones that do 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.109
 I remind you that you can read the full note through the triple double of 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.259
 points dead time two points
