on<00:00:26.370> the<00:00:26.460> website<00:00:26.790> if<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.630> you're<00:00:27.780> not<00:00:27.900> sure

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
on the website if if you're not sure

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.770 
on the website if if you're not sure
it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.770> very<00:00:28.950> simple<00:00:29.280> tuning<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> get<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.210> so

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
it's a very simple tuning to get to so

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.089 
it's a very simple tuning to get to so
what<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:31.620> by<00:00:31.770> doing<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
what we're going to start by doing is

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.209 
what we're going to start by doing is
tuning<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> low<00:00:32.850> E<00:00:33.120> string<00:00:33.320> down<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> D<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
tuning the low E string down to a D so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
tuning the low E string down to a D so
we<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:35.670> playing<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> open<00:00:36.510> D<00:00:36.660> string

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
we do that by playing the open D string

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.709 
we do that by playing the open D string
and<00:00:37.379> then<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> D<00:00:38.839> and<00:00:39.839> dropping<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.320> down

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
and then the D and dropping it down

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.959 
and then the D and dropping it down
doesn't<00:00:42.719> take<00:00:42.899> much<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.109> a<00:00:43.289> turn<00:00:43.499> that<00:00:43.679> one

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
doesn't take much of a turn that one

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.099 
doesn't take much of a turn that one
again<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:44.999> can<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> harmonic<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:46.019> the

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
again you can use the harmonic at the

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.290 
again you can use the harmonic at the
twelfth<00:00:46.469> fret<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:50.699> can<00:00:50.819> hear<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.089> it<00:00:51.120> goes

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
twelfth fret you can hear when it goes

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.279 
twelfth fret you can hear when it goes
out<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> tune<00:00:53.899> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.019> wobbles<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> bit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 

then<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.390> we've

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
then you get it and you're in now we've

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
then you get it and you're in now we've
got<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.870> tune<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> string<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.219> fifth

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
got to tune the a string the fifth

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.719 
got to tune the a string the fifth
string<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.510> G<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.589> play<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.100> open<00:01:05.549> g

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
string down to a G so we play the open g

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
string down to a G so we play the open g
string<00:01:05.759> which<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> third<00:01:06.689> string<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
string which is the third string and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.320 
string which is the third string and
they<00:01:09.799> tune<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.979> down

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.670 

you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.840 

again<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.830> can<00:01:17.950> use<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.130> harmonic<00:01:18.610> there<00:01:18.759> at

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
again you can use a harmonic there at

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.570 
again you can use a harmonic there at
the<00:01:18.909> 12th<00:01:19.270> fret

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.300 

to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.760> it<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.890> okay<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.160> we've

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to get it just right okay and now we've

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.100 
to get it just right okay and now we've
got<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> tune<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.940> thinnest<00:01:27.330> string<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
got to tune the thinnest string down a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
got to tune the thinnest string down a
tone<00:01:28.440> as<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.010> again<00:01:29.760> we're<00:01:29.910> using<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
tone as well so again we're using the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
tone as well so again we're using the
fourth<00:01:30.570> string<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.050> note<00:01:31.230> D<00:01:31.410> as<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> reference

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.600 

you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.520 

okay<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.670> can<00:01:42.880> use<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> harmonic<00:01:43.570> again<00:01:43.840> 12th

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
okay you can use a harmonic again 12th

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
okay you can use a harmonic again 12th
fret<00:01:44.680> of<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.860> fourth<00:01:45.190> string

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.160 

now<00:01:49.469> as<00:01:49.710> normal<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.880> open<00:01:51.539> tunings<00:01:51.929> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
now as normal with open tunings it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.779 
now as normal with open tunings it's
really<00:01:52.590> important<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.490> test

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
really important that you kind of test

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.010 
really important that you kind of test
it<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.240> very<00:01:54.450> likely<00:01:54.719> you're<00:01:54.899> going

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it because it's very likely you're going

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.719 
it because it's very likely you're going
to<00:01:55.109> have<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> tweak<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.679> little<00:01:55.799> bit<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.700> for

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to have to tweak a little bit now for

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
to have to tweak a little bit now for
open<00:01:57.359> G<00:01:57.659> tuning<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.319> just<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> remind<00:01:59.039> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
open G tuning I just want to remind you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.120 
open G tuning I just want to remind you
of<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> tuning<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.090> again<00:02:00.359> it<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.569> D<00:02:01.130> G

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
of what the tuning was again it was D G

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.509 
of what the tuning was again it was D G
D<00:02:02.939> G<00:02:03.869> B<00:02:04.109> and<00:02:05.039> D<00:02:05.100> okay<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.590> open<00:02:08.069> G<00:02:08.489> tuning

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
D G B and D okay now it's open G tuning

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.479 
D G B and D okay now it's open G tuning
so<00:02:09.209> G<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> note<00:02:10.019> we<00:02:10.200> want<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.920> G<00:02:11.190> was

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
so G is the note we want and the G was

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.910 
so G is the note we want and the G was
the<00:02:11.670> fifth<00:02:11.940> string<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.599> sixth<00:02:13.500> string<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the fifth string the sixth string the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160 
the fifth string the sixth string the
thickest<00:02:14.280> ring<00:02:14.459> was<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> note<00:02:14.910> D<00:02:15.209> now<00:02:15.840> any<00:02:16.019> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
thickest ring was the note D now any of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.449 
thickest ring was the note D now any of
you<00:02:16.260> guys<00:02:16.379> wondered<00:02:16.799> ever<00:02:16.890> why<00:02:17.129> Keith

in the way a lot of times in open G it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.410 
in the way a lot of times in open G it's
very<00:02:26.069> useful<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.519> well<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> lot<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.849> guys<00:02:27.030> use<00:02:27.299> it

very useful as well a lot of guys use it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.910 
very useful as well a lot of guys use it
really<00:02:27.599> well<00:02:27.720> at<00:02:27.959> particularly<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.470> acoustic

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
really well at particularly the acoustic

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
really well at particularly the acoustic
finger<00:02:29.190> style<00:02:29.400> guys<00:02:29.849> but<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.290> kind<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
finger style guys but in a kind of a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.020 
finger style guys but in a kind of a
rock<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:31.980> roll<00:02:32.130> context<00:02:32.610> you're<00:02:32.790> probably

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
rock and roll context you're probably

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.550 
rock and roll context you're probably
not<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.569> using<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.959> sixth<00:02:34.349> string

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
not going to be using that sixth string

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
not going to be using that sixth string
too<00:02:34.739> much<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.549> was<00:02:35.670> why<00:02:35.849> Keith<00:02:36.120> took<00:02:36.360> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
too much so that was why Keith took it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.330 
too much so that was why Keith took it
out<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.900> after<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> few<00:02:37.890> beers<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.220> guess

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
out you know after a few beers I guess

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.280 
out you know after a few beers I guess
it<00:02:38.459> was<00:02:38.579> just<00:02:38.610> easier<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.180> hit<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> guitar<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
it was just easier to hit the guitar and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
it was just easier to hit the guitar and
not<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.709> worry<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:41.010> missing<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
not have to worry about missing that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.819 
not have to worry about missing that
string<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.840> when<00:02:43.019> you're<00:02:43.170> doing<00:02:43.319> your<00:02:43.500> little

testing tuner or playing your riffs you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.809

fret of the fourth string that's where

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:09.430 
fret of the fourth string that's where
