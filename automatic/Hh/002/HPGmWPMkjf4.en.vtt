00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.940
 delighted with this here that it will go 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 definitely on our own 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.660
 inside then thanks martina and nothing 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.030
 This 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.380
 if this is this type of video 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.270
 you might not like it 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.520
 in case let me know if you want 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 send something it admits francesca 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.540
 find a link description that there 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 refers to a facebook page where in 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.650
 information you can find ours 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.030
 address because I did it that way because 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.130
 the people who want to see us 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 address could not find him immediately 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.899
 description sa is no too easy must 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.760
 go through a maze to find the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.920
 right direction looking for it and maybe then 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.750
 they will not find unseen even to say 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 that that address applies only to 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.710
 send us things because if we see here 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.380
 here under the house we throw you the buckets 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.020
 water really don't come visit us 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.940
 seriously it really is something there 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.130
 now I say it with a smile though it is 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 really a problem 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 in case someone comes to see us 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890
 we can't really afford at home 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.200
 so okay nothing this is here 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.520
 thanks again morning and congratulations 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 for your skill at the piano I we 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.250

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.550
