thousand calorie deficit that works out
to<00:01:54.780> roughly<00:01:54.990> should<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.799> about<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> pound<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
to roughly should be about a pound and a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.289 
to roughly should be about a pound and a
half<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.940> weight<00:01:57.180> loss<00:01:58.010> hopefully<00:01:59.010> all<00:01:59.040> fat<00:01:59.490> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
half of weight loss hopefully all fat to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.620 
half of weight loss hopefully all fat to
try<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.630> compensate<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.560> whole<00:02:02.360> concept<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
try and compensate the whole concept and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
try and compensate the whole concept and
people<00:02:03.869> say<00:02:03.960> you're<00:02:04.470> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.650> lose<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.979> your

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
people say you're going to lose all your

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.330 
people say you're going to lose all your
muscle<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.970> die<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.299> down<00:02:07.220> there's<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
muscle will you die it down there's a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.009 
muscle will you die it down there's a
lot<00:02:08.519> of<00:02:08.670> research<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.840> totally

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
lot of research on that and be totally

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.380 
lot of research on that and be totally
honest<00:02:10.500> one<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.610> lose<00:02:11.730> muscle<00:02:12.030> until

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
honest one you don't lose muscle until

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.260 
honest one you don't lose muscle until
you<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.900> get

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you really get

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.620 
you really get
the<00:02:13.420> extreme<00:02:13.720> low<00:02:13.990> body<00:02:14.200> fat<00:02:14.350> situations<00:02:15.250> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the extreme low body fat situations and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.610 
the extreme low body fat situations and
everybody's<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> have<00:02:17.020> different<00:02:17.260> set

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
everybody's going to have different set

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.350 
everybody's going to have different set
points<00:02:18.010> when<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.280> comes<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.640> wear<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.060> body

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
points when it comes to wear that body

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.540 
points when it comes to wear that body
fat<00:02:19.960> percentage<00:02:20.560> sort<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.860> kicks<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
fat percentage sort of kicks in and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.360 
fat percentage sort of kicks in and
starts<00:02:22.270> taking<00:02:22.630> muscle<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.950> know<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.280> me

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
starts taking muscle but you know for me

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.400 
starts taking muscle but you know for me
I<00:02:24.400> stay<00:02:24.910> around<00:02:25.180> eight<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.750> nine<00:02:25.900> percent<00:02:26.320> all

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
I stay around eight to nine percent all

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.020 
I stay around eight to nine percent all
year<00:02:26.620> round<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.340> me<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.520> get<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.700> lower

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
year round so for me to get to lower

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.870 
year round so for me to get to lower
body<00:02:28.360> fat<00:02:28.660> percentages<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.290> five<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.770> six<00:02:30.040> it

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
body fat percentages of five or six it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.820 
body fat percentages of five or six it
doesn't<00:02:31.270> really<00:02:31.420> sacrifice<00:02:32.170> too<00:02:32.380> much<00:02:32.410> muscle

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
doesn't really sacrifice too much muscle

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.800 
doesn't really sacrifice too much muscle
you<00:02:33.160> start<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.700> feel<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.450> start<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
you start to feel it and you start to

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.210 
you start to feel it and you start to
get<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:34.990> little<00:02:35.050> bit<00:02:35.290> low<00:02:35.410> energy<00:02:35.830> when<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.070> get

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
get a little bit low energy when we get

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.340 
get a little bit low energy when we get
down<00:02:36.400> there<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:37.150> I'm<00:02:37.360> not<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.750> affected<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
down there but I'm not as affected as a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.050 
down there but I'm not as affected as a
lot<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.650> other<00:02:38.770> people<00:02:38.980> are<00:02:39.340> because<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.970> know

when<00:02:44.770> they<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:44.980> under<00:02:45.190> 10<00:02:45.460> their<00:02:45.700> bodies<00:02:45.970> are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
when they get under 10 their bodies are

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.670 
when they get under 10 their bodies are
kind<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.330> like<00:02:46.420> yeah<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:47.230> are<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.350> doing<00:02:47.590> to

really don't go over ten percent ever so
it's<00:02:53.980> really<00:02:54.190> easy<00:02:54.460> for<00:02:54.760> me<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.810> rip<00:02:56.320> it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
it's really easy for me to just rip it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.890 
it's really easy for me to just rip it
down<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.460> I<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.270> good<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> other

changed<00:06:24.870> too<00:06:25.170> much<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.740> mean<00:06:26.240> technology<00:06:27.240> is

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
changed too much I mean technology is

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
technology it's not an exact thing so

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.220 
technology it's not an exact thing so
technically<00:06:30.480> I<00:06:30.570> should<00:06:30.780> have<00:06:30.870> lost<00:06:31.050> at<00:06:31.200> least
