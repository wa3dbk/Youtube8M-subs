construction<00:00:01.469> number<00:00:01.709> 22<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.970> orthocenter

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
construction number 22 the orthocenter

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.100 
construction number 22 the orthocenter
of<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.080> triangle<00:00:06.020> so<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> start<00:00:08.540> we're<00:00:09.540> taking<00:00:09.990> my

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
of a triangle so I start we're taking my

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.089 
of a triangle so I start we're taking my
compass<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:12.049> adjusting<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.920> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
compass and adjusting it so that it is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.670 
compass and adjusting it so that it is
to<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> length<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.900> BC<00:00:16.220> from<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.529> draw<00:00:19.529> an

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to the length of BC from here I draw an

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.340 
to the length of BC from here I draw an
arc<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> compass<00:00:20.490> point<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.350> through

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
arc with the compass point on be through

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
arc with the compass point on be through
a<00:00:22.529> B<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.570> change<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.750> compass<00:00:25.199> point<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
a B I change my compass point so that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740 
a B I change my compass point so that
it's<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.189> C<00:00:26.490> keeping<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> composite<00:00:27.480> same

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's on C keeping the composite same

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.179 
it's on C keeping the composite same
width<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.800> draw<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.160> arc<00:00:29.480> through<00:00:30.480> AC<00:00:31.189> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
width and I draw an arc through AC that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.229 
width and I draw an arc through AC that
gives<00:00:32.460> me<00:00:32.700> two<00:00:33.239> points<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:34.260> column<00:00:34.969> D<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.660> E

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
gives me two points as column D and E

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.900 
gives me two points as column D and E
kicks<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.629> take<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.739> compass<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.309> place<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> back

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
kicks I take my compass I place a back

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
kicks I take my compass I place a back
on<00:00:42.120> B<00:00:42.329> again<00:00:42.660> i<00:00:43.250> justed<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.789> greater

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
on B again i justed so that it's greater

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.069 
on B again i justed so that it's greater
than<00:00:46.050> half<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.530> width<00:00:46.710> between<00:00:46.950> B<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.399> D<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
than half the width between B and D I

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
than half the width between B and D I
draw<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.200> arc<00:00:50.000> outside<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.469> triangle<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.879> put

the compass point on D this time I make

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
the compass point on D this time I make
sure<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> keep<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> width<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.449> same<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
sure I keep the width the same and I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.360 
sure I keep the width the same and I
draw<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.430> arc<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.420> intersects<00:01:00.600> s<00:01:01.370> initial

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

between<00:01:12.390> E<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.689> F<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:13.979> compass<00:01:14.369> point

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
between E and F I put my compass point

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.859 
between E and F I put my compass point
on<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.420> draw<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.409> AK<00:01:17.030> outside<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.240> triangle

on see I draw an AK outside my triangle

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.160 
on see I draw an AK outside my triangle
I<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.100> compass<00:01:20.430> point<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.850> E<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> draw

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I put my compass point on E and draw

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.670 
I put my compass point on E and draw
another<00:01:22.229> earth<00:01:22.619> outside<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:24.000> triangle<00:01:24.680> let's

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
another earth outside my triangle let's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.110 
another earth outside my triangle let's
call<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.189> point<00:01:27.140> Jean

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
call this point Jean

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:38.650 
call this point Jean
I<00:01:29.180> join<00:01:32.110> f2c<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:37.130> what<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.520> guess<00:01:37.760> is<00:01:38.090> a

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
I join f2c and what I guess is a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.490 
I join f2c and what I guess is a
right-hand<00:01:39.350> girl<00:01:39.500> here<00:01:40.040> at<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.670> B<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.500> this

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
right-hand girl here at a B and this

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.360 
right-hand girl here at a B and this
line<00:01:42.830> from<00:01:43.460> C<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.750> B<00:01:44.870> is<00:01:45.590> what's<00:01:45.860> known<00:01:46.070> as<00:01:46.130> an

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
line from C to a B is what's known as an

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.080 
line from C to a B is what's known as an
altitude<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.510> triangle<00:01:48.340> again<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.730> joined

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
altitude of the triangle again I joined

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.990 
altitude of the triangle again I joined
B<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:51.530> G

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.630 

this<00:02:00.000> forms<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.420> right<00:02:00.570> angle<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> seat<00:02:02.370> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
this forms a right angle with a seat and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040 
this forms a right angle with a seat and
again<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.140> point<00:02:04.350> B<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> C<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:06.000> an<00:02:06.690> altitude

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
again the point B to a C is an altitude

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.020 
again the point B to a C is an altitude
and<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.190> point<00:02:08.460> at<00:02:08.610> which<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:08.970> two

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and the point at which these two

and the point at which these two
altitudes<00:02:09.780> meet<00:02:10.110> let's<00:02:10.530> call<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> o<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:12.000> the
