it didn't look like it was going to be
that<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> game<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.540> 25<00:00:43.530> minutes

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

Bradley hung in there they did I mean

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
they played well defensively most of the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
year so I thought they might be able to
get<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.090> early<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.719> I
