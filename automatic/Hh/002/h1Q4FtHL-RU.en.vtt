there's<00:01:21.750> no<00:01:21.960> perfect<00:01:22.710> security<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.100> someone

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there's no perfect security when someone

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
there's no perfect security when someone
says<00:01:23.460> secure<00:01:23.850> its<00:01:24.360> secure<00:01:25.049> compared<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.040> what

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
says secure its secure compared to what

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
says secure its secure compared to what
exactly<00:01:26.670> care<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.630> standard<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
exactly care to what standard and I

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.929 
exactly care to what standard and I
think<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> biggest<00:01:29.460> advantage<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
think that the biggest advantage that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.190 
think that the biggest advantage that
we're<00:01:30.119> gonna<00:01:30.210> bring<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> industry<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we're gonna bring to the industry is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560 
we're gonna bring to the industry is
that<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.040> close<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.520> any<00:01:32.759> vulnerability

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that we will close out any vulnerability

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.870 
that we will close out any vulnerability
that<00:01:34.170> we're<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.130> we've<00:01:35.280> become<00:01:35.460> aware<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that we're that we've become aware of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210 
that we're that we've become aware of
faster<00:01:36.659> than<00:01:36.810> anyone<00:01:37.049> else<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> think

smaller what do you have the battery to
two<00:03:09.530> thousand<00:03:09.920> milliamp<00:03:10.130> battery<00:03:10.310> wild<00:03:11.000> Oh

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
two thousand milliamp battery wild Oh

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.850 
two thousand milliamp battery wild Oh
fantastic<00:03:11.840> yeah<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.080> it's<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:12.680> bad

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
fantastic yeah so it's not it's not bad

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.620 
fantastic yeah so it's not it's not bad
we've<00:03:13.190> also<00:03:13.340> done<00:03:13.550> some<00:03:13.760> things<00:03:13.970> which<00:03:14.180> you

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
we've also done some things which you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.120 
we've also done some things which you
know<00:03:14.690> all<00:03:15.080> right<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.410> while<00:03:15.650> well<00:03:15.950> I'm<00:03:16.040> a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
know all right so while well I'm a

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.789 
know all right so while well I'm a
security<00:03:16.370> guy<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:17.660> love<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.200> technology

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
security guy and I love the technology

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.979 
security guy and I love the technology
probably<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.580> think<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.940> coolest<00:03:20.209> thing<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.630> me

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
probably I think the coolest thing to me

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.960 
probably I think the coolest thing to me
was<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.700> whole<00:03:22.970> part<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.519> right<00:03:25.760> now

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
was that this whole part of so right now

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.030 
was that this whole part of so right now
I<00:03:26.330> can<00:03:27.110> actually<00:03:27.140> because<00:03:27.530> it's<00:03:27.650> got<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.769> four

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
I can actually because it's got a four

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.570 
I can actually because it's got a four
core<00:03:28.250> processor<00:03:28.880> here<00:03:29.440> I'm<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:31.070> change<00:03:31.370> it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
core processor here I'm I can change it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.340 
core processor here I'm I can change it
to<00:03:31.700> where<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.209> want<00:03:32.630> my<00:03:32.660> back<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.170> change

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
to where I want my back I can change

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.560 
to where I want my back I can change
down<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.530> two<00:03:33.680> cores<00:03:33.920> oh<00:03:34.250> nice<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.330> can

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
down to two cores oh nice and so I can

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.970 
down to two cores oh nice and so I can
start<00:03:35.750> changing<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.230> settings<00:03:36.560> where<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.799> go

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
start changing the settings where I go

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.740 
start changing the settings where I go
completely<00:03:37.190> insane<00:03:37.640> mode<00:03:38.150> right<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.570> just

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
completely insane mode right I just

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870 
completely insane mode right I just
because<00:03:39.290> maybe<00:03:39.380> I'd<00:03:39.590> like<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.799> do<00:03:39.950> all<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
because maybe I'd like to do all the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.199 
because maybe I'd like to do all the
lovely<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.530> live<00:03:43.400> streaming<00:03:43.940> video<00:03:44.150> and

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
lovely you know live streaming video and

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.479 
lovely you know live streaming video and
audio<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.530> take<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.890> frequency<00:03:46.190> limit

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
audio so I can take the frequency limit

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.759 
audio so I can take the frequency limit
turn<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.880> off<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.480> unit<00:03:48.019> frames<00:03:48.200> per<00:03:48.380> second

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
turn it off the unit frames per second

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.070 
turn it off the unit frames per second
off<00:03:48.980> full<00:03:49.790> max<00:03:50.030> cores<00:03:50.360> or<00:03:50.630> anywhere<00:03:51.049> in

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
off full max cores or anywhere in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.170 
off full max cores or anywhere in
between
