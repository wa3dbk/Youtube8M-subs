 For a long time he still loves us 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.320
 you need a lot of explanation to both without 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.970
 fast playstation homeland we say 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.519
 the the one let's go with this being recorded 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.019
 with the mobile is late, it's twelve o'clock 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.789
 fourth I do not know when we will upload this 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.310
 I suppose we'll upload it there to the loga 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.249
 pl goes but see how you can see 15 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.499
 stained by and brownfield that also what 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.419
 I have in the xv orbÃ¡n but many friends 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.570
 they are going to buy it in the play so 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.610
 has given up the vertical support very 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 important because as you can see 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 of this black thing that there is that video vhs 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 and the little camera then to make range a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.930
 little while 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.780
 this is a both without professionals 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:06.760
 I totally go 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.760
 as the panthers would say six times more 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.450
 we have here the code of a position in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.450
 the table to change when we can 200 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 games 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.930
 here you do not need 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.250
 pretty 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.440
 the most important thing is the person 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.700
 first always the manuals that sell 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 very pretty they 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.170
 The damn 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.170
 with plastic 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 but now 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.670
 Hello 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.290
 to look for something 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.450
 the power cable 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.750
 this is like a micro usb very well this 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.290
 is the shabby current cable 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.290
 forever 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.330
 and an hdmi 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.849
 on the beach 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.870
 and neither do I 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.270
 Ok then I'm going to remove the plastic 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:32.049
 thanks to the jacket 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.440
 the unboxing although I have many dreams 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.440
 also take them out 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.569
 So far we have returned from the trip 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.019
 to throw the station box 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.019
 let's open 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.190
 so I need the knife 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.099
 so rajoy the annoying 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
 good 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.860
 it's barely broken by doing the same thing 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.860
 the gums 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.000
 Let's see 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.000
 another instruction paper and nothing else 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.620
 then I'm riding the video 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 so the sensor camera 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:55.650
 iphone splinter advances light 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.650
 but it is very small 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.520
 let's go for the vertical support one thing 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.520
 plus 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.159
 Y 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.020
 Let's see 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.020
 tension music or something here 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.560
 you are waiting, it is already 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.670
 in solutions for all 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.280
 Y 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.280
 or 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:49.780
 hey what 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.780
 also fit with the part let's see 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.550
 the instructions 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.830
 imposes 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.830
 I see absolutely nothing until the end 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.440
 well look, the nice one is already 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:16.639
 apart from me monolith has some jewels and 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.639
 three of weird but good 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.660
 had the length of the English court besides 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:31.490
 awareness 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.490
 if it 's good let's put here 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.400
 the study of dust the surface 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:55.940
 We will leave the 63rd I think it would be seen 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.940
 as a vertical support 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.240
 we have to start
