the map so my tip number one is if you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.350 
the map so my tip number one is if you
are<00:02:22.350> getting<00:02:22.800> killed<00:02:23.160> by<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> lot<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.580> BS<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
are getting killed by a lot of BS and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
killstreaks use support instead when you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.490 
killstreaks use support instead when you
die<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.540> support<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.110> doesn't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
you just keep going until you get your

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.370 
you just keep going until you get your
EMP<00:02:38.190> stealth<00:02:39.000> bomber<00:02:39.270> whatever<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.200> may<00:02:40.350> be

EMP stealth bomber whatever it may be

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.190 
EMP stealth bomber whatever it may be
and<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.580> may<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.000> as<00:02:42.240> fun<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.630> use<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.840> may

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and it may not be as fun to use and may

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.100 
and it may not be as fun to use and may
not<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.650> rewarding<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.450> least<00:02:45.840> you'll

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
not be as rewarding but at least you'll

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.230 
not be as rewarding but at least you'll
get<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.410> more<00:02:46.620> often<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.670> doesn't<00:02:47.970> mean<00:02:48.060> just

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
get it more often that doesn't mean just

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.330 
get it more often that doesn't mean just
go<00:02:48.450> ahead<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.720> throw<00:02:49.350> away<00:02:49.380> using<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.920> salt<00:02:50.220> all

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
go ahead and throw away using a salt all

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.980 
go ahead and throw away using a salt all
together<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.630> one<00:02:51.720> or<00:02:51.840> two

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
together just do it for one or two

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.770 
together just do it for one or two
Dame's<00:02:52.350> calm<00:02:53.190> down<00:02:53.220> relax<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.240> then<00:02:54.540> come

Dame's calm down relax and then come

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.330 
Dame's calm down relax and then come
back<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.560> course<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.040> always<00:02:56.130> use

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
back of course you can always use

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.590 
back of course you can always use
specialists<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.240> then<00:02:58.050> again<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.980> die

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
specialists but then again you do die

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000 
specialists but then again you do die
well<00:03:00.600> when<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.870> do<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.590> lose<00:03:01.620> your

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
streak so I recommend using support for

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.240 
streak so I recommend using support for
a<00:03:04.860> little<00:03:04.980> bit<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.520> relax<00:03:06.230> all<00:03:07.230> right<00:03:07.290> now

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
the most just putting down the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.040 
the most just putting down the
controller<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.389> going<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.690> do<00:05:06.810> something

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
way to relieve that stress before you

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.100 
way to relieve that stress before you
know<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.789> you'll<00:05:11.909> be<00:05:11.940> pumped<00:05:12.360> up<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:12.630> ready<00:05:12.690> to

know it you'll be pumped up and ready to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.870 
know it you'll be pumped up and ready to
play<00:05:13.470> again<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:14.250> when<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.400> take<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:14.639> break

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
play again so when you take this break

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.100 
play again so when you take this break
