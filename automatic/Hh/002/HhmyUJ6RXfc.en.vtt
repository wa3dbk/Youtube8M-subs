00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.459 

infiltration<00:06:12.029> try<00:06:13.029> disaster<00:06:13.719> and<00:06:13.929> aggression

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
infiltration try disaster and aggression

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.679 
infiltration try disaster and aggression
and<00:06:15.189> what<00:06:15.339> you<00:06:15.490> basically<00:06:15.669> do<00:06:16.179> is<00:06:16.209> when<00:06:16.569> you

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689 
and what you basically do is when you

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.009 
and what you basically do is when you
have<00:06:16.869> this<00:06:17.079> platinum<00:06:17.559> in<00:06:17.740> got<00:06:17.919> what<00:06:18.909> you<00:06:19.029> do<00:06:19.240> is

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:22.019 

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.199 

you<00:06:23.019> need<00:06:23.229> that<00:06:23.409> TP<00:06:23.860> again<00:06:24.159> so<00:06:24.579> what<00:06:24.849> i<00:06:24.879> did<00:06:24.999> was

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:25.209 
you need that TP again so what i did was

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:34.529 
you need that TP again so what i did was
i<00:06:25.800> equipped<00:06:26.800> faith<00:06:30.479> with<00:06:32.639> the<00:06:33.639> guests<00:06:34.089> guess

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
i equipped faith with the guests guess

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.239 
i equipped faith with the guests guess
so<00:06:34.749> I<00:06:35.050> don't<00:06:35.319> notice<00:06:35.409> pronounced<00:06:36.009> I<00:06:36.069> guess

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:36.249 
so I don't notice pronounced I guess

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.519 
so I don't notice pronounced I guess
I'll<00:06:36.399> TP<00:06:36.819> boost<00:06:37.119> so<00:06:37.300> every<00:06:37.569> time<00:06:37.779> you<00:06:38.050> hit<00:06:38.379> an

enemy<00:06:38.619> you<00:06:39.009> regenerate<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:39.579> bit<00:06:39.789> of<00:06:39.879> TP<00:06:40.300> and

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
enemy you regenerate a bit of TP and

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.019 
enemy you regenerate a bit of TP and
every<00:06:41.110> time<00:06:41.319> it<00:06:41.559> has<00:06:41.679> victory<00:06:42.189> TP<00:06:42.669> charge<00:06:42.909> so

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:43.029 
every time it has victory TP charge so

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.239 
every time it has victory TP charge so
every<00:06:43.149> time<00:06:43.269> you<00:06:43.419> kill<00:06:43.599> him<00:06:43.689> anyway<00:06:44.249> it
