00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.529 
going to be doing a EGR valve removal
which<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.109> exhaust<00:00:16.500> gas<00:00:17.539> recirculation

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
which is an exhaust gas recirculation

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
which is an exhaust gas recirculation

system for extra burning for this task
running<00:00:33.719> two<00:00:33.930> following<00:00:34.200> parts

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.250 

yes<00:00:56.980> steps<00:00:57.580> quite<00:00:57.790> easily<00:00:58.120> there's<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.630> pipe

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
yes steps quite easily there's the pipe

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.830 
yes steps quite easily there's the pipe
Li<00:00:59.500> after<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.830> place<00:01:00.070> on<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.400> top<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:01.600> there's

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
Li after a place on the top and there's

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.180 
Li after a place on the top and there's
just<00:01:01.990> the<00:01:02.110> blanking<00:01:02.500> plate<00:01:02.680> basically<00:01:03.070> we

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
just the blanking plate basically we

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.439 
just the blanking plate basically we
fall<00:01:03.400> to<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.610> nuts<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:03.880> bolts<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.210> fatigue

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
fall to the nuts and bolts the fatigue

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.990 
fall to the nuts and bolts the fatigue
of<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.570> gasket<00:01:04.980> EGR<00:01:05.980> or<00:01:06.220> exhaust<00:01:06.700> gas

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
of the gasket EGR or exhaust gas

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.330 
of the gasket EGR or exhaust gas
recirculation<00:01:07.600> allows<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> controlled<00:01:09.010> amount

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
recirculation allows a controlled amount

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760 
recirculation allows a controlled amount
of<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.730> exhaust<00:01:10.150> gasses<00:01:10.660> back<00:01:11.020> into<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> air

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
of the exhaust gasses back into the air

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.230 
of the exhaust gasses back into the air
intake<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.730> td5<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.690> 300tdi<00:01:14.620> engines<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
intake of the td5 and 300tdi engines the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.000 
intake of the td5 and 300tdi engines the
reason<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.200> reduce<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.740> amount

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
reason for this is to reduce the amount

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.980 
reason for this is to reduce the amount
of<00:01:18.130> nitrous<00:01:18.610> oxide<00:01:18.820> being<00:01:19.360> thrown<00:01:19.660> out<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
of nitrous oxide being thrown out the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.080 
of nitrous oxide being thrown out the
back<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.440> also<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.010> quieten<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.700> engine

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
back and also to quieten the engine

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.270 
back and also to quieten the engine
slightly<00:01:22.540> whilst<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:23.590> does<00:01:23.860> sound<00:01:24.130> like<00:01:24.220> a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
slightly whilst this does sound like a

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.110 
slightly whilst this does sound like a
good<00:01:24.550> idea<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:25.180> has<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> few<00:01:25.690> downsides<00:01:25.900> it

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
good idea it has a few downsides it

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.580 
good idea it has a few downsides it
reduces<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.300> combustion<00:01:28.690> temperature<00:01:29.380> which

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
reduces the combustion temperature which

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.830 
reduces the combustion temperature which
means<00:01:29.619> that<00:01:30.009> less<00:01:30.190> fuel<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.580> burned<00:01:30.820> off<00:01:31.030> this

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
means that less fuel is burned off this

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.540 
means that less fuel is burned off this
reduces<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.350> performance<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.009> your<00:01:33.040> engine

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
reduces the performance of your engine

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.120 
reduces the performance of your engine
these<00:01:34.390> days<00:01:34.690> we<00:01:34.930> can't<00:01:35.200> think<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.680> reason<00:01:35.890> to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
these days we can't think of a reason to

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.390 
these days we can't think of a reason to
not<00:01:36.520> remove<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.000> EGR<00:01:37.330> system<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.950> should<00:01:38.979> see

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
not remove the EGR system you should see

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.910 
not remove the EGR system you should see
an<00:01:39.520> increase<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:40.060> power<00:01:40.240> many<00:01:41.140> also<00:01:41.380> report

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
an increase in power many also report

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.790 
an increase in power many also report
higher<00:01:42.190> mpg<00:01:42.910> figures<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.540> over<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> life<00:01:44.650> of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
higher mpg figures and over the life of

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.230 
higher mpg figures and over the life of
your<00:01:44.860> engine<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.520> will<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:45.790> removed<00:01:46.119> some

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
your engine you will have removed some

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.090 
your engine you will have removed some
pretty<00:01:46.690> ugly<00:01:46.930> problems<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.800> may<00:01:47.979> occur

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
pretty ugly problems that may occur

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
pretty ugly problems that may occur
later<00:01:48.520> on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
redundant once the valves removed we

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.860 
redundant once the valves removed we
just<00:02:29.049> took<00:02:29.170> down<00:02:29.380> at<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.739> nicely
