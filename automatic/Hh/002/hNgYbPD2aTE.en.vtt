warehouse will control the atmosphere
pretty<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.409> believe<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.950> some

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
pretty much I don't believe it's some

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
pretty much I don't believe it's some
type<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.790> tower<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.600> babel<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.500> has

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
type of a tower of babel that has

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
type of a tower of babel that has
something<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> easter<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> like

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
something to do with the easter a like

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.089 
something to do with the easter a like
when<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.050> complete<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> easter<00:02:10.770> egg<00:02:10.890> this

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
when you complete the easter egg this

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.370 
when you complete the easter egg this
shines<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:12.300> Richthofen<00:02:12.989> has<00:02:13.140> had

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
shines because Richthofen has had

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.110 
shines because Richthofen has had
the<00:02:13.590> starting<00:02:13.950> pistol<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.550> game<00:02:14.760> so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the starting pistol of the game so

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.590 
the starting pistol of the game so
obviously<00:02:15.630> he's<00:02:15.900> very<00:02:16.800> early<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> in

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
obviously he's very early on in the in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.070 
obviously he's very early on in the in
the<00:02:18.660> games<00:02:19.230> very<00:02:20.220> early<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> levels<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the games very early on in the levels so

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.980 
the games very early on in the levels so
you<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.190> far<00:02:23.550> enough<00:02:23.730> far<00:02:24.480> enough<00:02:24.750> in

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
you want to be far enough far enough in

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.020 
you want to be far enough far enough in
the<00:02:25.170> game<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.800> completed<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.730> easter

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the game to have completed the easter

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.350 
the game to have completed the easter
egg<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:29.280> i<00:02:29.310> believe<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.820> tower<00:02:30.030> does

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
egg but what i believe this tower does

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
egg but what i believe this tower does
and<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.900> warehouse<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.710> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and what this warehouse that is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.640 
and what this warehouse that is
connected<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.820> do<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.690> believe<00:02:34.200> it's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
connected to will do is I believe it's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.370 
connected to will do is I believe it's
able<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> control<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.210> weather<00:02:36.360> pretty<00:02:37.140> much

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
able to control the weather pretty much

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.420 
able to control the weather pretty much
I<00:02:38.060> believe<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.800> may<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> characters

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I believe that you may be the characters

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.670 
I believe that you may be the characters
themselves<00:02:41.640> may<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.900> able<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.290> control

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
themselves may not be able to control

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.500 
themselves may not be able to control
the<00:02:43.980> weather<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.550> believe<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.180> tower

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the weather but I believe this tower

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.080 
the weather but I believe this tower
whoever's<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.770> will<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.400> able<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.640> control

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
whoever's in it will be able to control

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.370 
whoever's in it will be able to control
the<00:02:48.240> weather<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.900> change<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.230> from

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
the weather they will change it from

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.650 
the weather they will change it from
rain<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.740> snow<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.460> things<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
rain to snow and things like that and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.530 
rain to snow and things like that and
since<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.590> map<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.090> set<00:02:54.330> in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
since this map is going to be set in

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.960 
since this map is going to be set in
France<00:02:54.870> somewhere<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.250> no<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.790> don't

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
France somewhere you know no we don't

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.600 
France somewhere you know no we don't
really<00:02:57.210> know<00:02:57.360> yet<00:02:57.500> where<00:02:58.500> exactly<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.280> France

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
really know yet where exactly in France

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.550 
really know yet where exactly in France
but<00:02:59.940> since<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.480> set<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> France<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.290> believe

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
but since it is set in France I believe

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.280 
but since it is set in France I believe
this<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:01.860> somewhat<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.460> war<00:03:02.880> strategy<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:04.050> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
this is somewhat a war strategy that the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.270 
this is somewhat a war strategy that the
French<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.800> been<00:03:04.980> using<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:06.290> UM<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.830> fight

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
French have been using to UM to fight

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.510 
French have been using to UM to fight
against<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.180> Germans<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.860> believe<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
against the Germans and I believe that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.310 
against the Germans and I believe that
the<00:03:11.910> French<00:03:12.210> were<00:03:12.300> using<00:03:12.930> things<00:03:13.200> like

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the French were using things like

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160 
the French were using things like
lightning<00:03:14.070> rain<00:03:14.670> thunder<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.420> make<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.720> harder

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
lightning rain thunder to make it harder

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.360 
lightning rain thunder to make it harder
for<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.530> Germans<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.660> advance<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.370> attack

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
for the Germans to advance into a attack

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.200 
for the Germans to advance into a attack
them<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.210> they<00:03:21.840> created<00:03:22.410> some<00:03:22.680> sort<00:03:22.710> of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
them so they they created some sort of

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.780 
them so they they created some sort of
some<00:03:24.210> sort<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.570> idea<00:03:25.130> sort<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.220> speak<00:03:26.520> they

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
some sort of idea sort of speak they

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.270 
some sort of idea sort of speak they
created<00:03:27.240> some<00:03:27.420> sort<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:28.250> technology<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
created some sort of technology that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.070 
created some sort of technology that
will<00:03:29.610> be<00:03:29.790> able<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.030> control<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.510> rain<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.870> help

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
will be able to control the rain to help

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.140 
will be able to control the rain to help
them<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> war<00:03:31.710> which<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.550> great<00:03:32.790> idea<00:03:32.940> if

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
them in the war which is a great idea if

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.510 
them in the war which is a great idea if
you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.510> control<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:33.990> rain<00:03:34.230> or<00:03:34.800> if<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.370> can

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
you can control the rain or if you can

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.610 
you can control the rain or if you can
control<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.090> weather<00:03:36.240> period<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.320> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
control the weather period you have a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.220 
control the weather period you have a
great<00:03:37.890> advantage<00:03:38.310> over<00:03:38.610> your<00:03:38.880> enemy<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:39.960> why<00:03:40.200> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
great advantage over your enemy so why I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.050 
great advantage over your enemy so why I
believe<00:03:40.500> richtofen<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.340> strategically

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
believe richtofen is strategically

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.540 
believe richtofen is strategically
placed<00:03:42.390> into<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:42.900> image<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.530> because<00:03:44.280> since

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
placed into this image is because since

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.540 
placed into this image is because since
richtofen<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.270> a<00:03:45.300> German<00:03:45.890> he<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.010> most<00:03:47.250> likely

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
richtofen is a German he is most likely

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.040 
richtofen is a German he is most likely
since<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.360> 20<00:03:48.690> years<00:03:48.720> before<00:03:50.630> or<00:03:51.630> since

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
since this is 20 years before or since

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.530 
since this is 20 years before or since
is<00:03:52.260> based<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.800> nineteen<00:03:53.370> seventeen<00:03:54.240> I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
is based in like nineteen seventeen I

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.660 
is based in like nineteen seventeen I
believe<00:03:54.930> but<00:03:55.770> since<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.160> based<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.490> that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
believe but since it is based in that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
believe but since it is based in that
time<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.630> war<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.020> obviously<00:03:58.440> still<00:03:58.709> raging

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
time the war is obviously still raging

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.210 
time the war is obviously still raging
on<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.840> Richtofen<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.990> probably<00:04:01.560> trying<00:04:02.040> to

end this video is I believe that it's

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.140 
end this video is I believe that it's
going<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:38.080> somewhat<00:04:38.620> abrupt<00:04:39.340> type

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
going to have somewhat abrupt type

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.400 
going to have somewhat abrupt type
filling<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.259> it<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:42.960> because<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.199> you<00:04:44.289> guys

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
filling to it that because if you guys

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.200 
filling to it that because if you guys
have<00:04:44.650> ever<00:04:44.770> played<00:04:45.070> for<00:04:45.190> up<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.820> at<00:04:46.000> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
have ever played for up to at the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.260 
have ever played for up to at the
beginning<00:04:46.389> of<00:04:46.930> rush<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.860> are<00:04:48.039> split<00:04:48.460> into<00:04:48.669> two

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
beginning of rush you are split into two

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.629 
beginning of rush you are split into two
sides<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> map<00:04:50.080> two<00:04:50.410> players<00:04:50.949> on<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.370> side

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
sides of the map two players on one side

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.969 
sides of the map two players on one side
two<00:04:52.000> players<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.539> the<00:04:52.660> other<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:53.080> believe<00:04:53.949> that

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
two players on the other I believe that

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.040 
two players on the other I believe that
they<00:04:54.520> are<00:04:54.639> going<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:55.000> do<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.509> exact<00:04:55.930> same

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
they are going to do the exact same

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.550 
they are going to do the exact same
thing<00:04:56.740> with<00:04:57.039> this<00:04:57.190> map<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.900> know<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.229> may<00:04:59.380> seem

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
thing with this map I know it may seem

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.420 
thing with this map I know it may seem
like<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.949> old<00:05:01.590> concept<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:03.039> throw<00:05:03.400> away

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
like a old concept to just throw away

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.240 
like a old concept to just throw away
but<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.270> don't<00:05:04.630> think<00:05:04.810> they<00:05:04.930> will<00:05:05.190> instead<00:05:06.190> of

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
but I don't think they will instead of

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.129 
but I don't think they will instead of
having<00:05:06.550> two<00:05:06.820> players<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.419> each<00:05:07.630> side<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:07.960> the

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
having two players on each side of the

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.950 
having two players on each side of the
map<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.470> think<00:05:08.710> they're<00:05:08.889> going<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.310> cut<00:05:09.610> each

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
map I think they're going to cut each

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.379 
map I think they're going to cut each
each<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.410> every<00:05:11.860> player<00:05:12.039> into<00:05:12.550> four<00:05:12.820> sides<00:05:13.120> of

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
each and every player into four sides of

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.570 
each and every player into four sides of
the<00:05:13.539> map<00:05:13.750> or<00:05:14.020> four<00:05:14.289> corners<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.979> map<00:05:15.310> you

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
the map or four corners of the map you

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.210 
the map or four corners of the map you
will<00:05:16.270> not<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.139> don't<00:05:17.289> I<00:05:17.680> believe<00:05:17.979> that<00:05:18.010> you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
will not you I don't I believe that you

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.870 
will not you I don't I believe that you
will<00:05:18.340> not<00:05:18.610> start<00:05:19.120> off<00:05:19.300> with<00:05:20.490> with<00:05:21.490> all<00:05:21.639> four

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
will not start off with with all four

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.550 
will not start off with with all four
characters<00:05:22.360> together<00:05:22.570> which<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.110> believe<00:05:23.349> is<00:05:23.410> a

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
characters together which I believe is a

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.350 
characters together which I believe is a
great<00:05:23.830> idea<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.340> love<00:05:24.610> Denver<00:05:24.820> ugh<00:05:25.090> those

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
great idea that I love Denver ugh those

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.360 
great idea that I love Denver ugh those
something<00:05:25.780> new<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.139> exciting<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.740> me<00:05:26.889> when<00:05:27.340> I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
something new and exciting to me when I

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.779 
something new and exciting to me when I
first<00:05:27.610> played<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.120> map<00:05:28.949> and<00:05:29.949> I<00:05:30.400> believe<00:05:30.639> they

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
first played the map and I believe they

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.279 
first played the map and I believe they
are<00:05:30.820> doing<00:05:31.060> this<00:05:31.300> just<00:05:31.599> because<00:05:31.660> they're<00:05:32.139> on

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
are doing this just because they're on

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.200 
are doing this just because they're on
different<00:05:32.650> sides<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.490> war<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:34.180> they

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
different sides of the war so they

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.060 
different sides of the war so they
shouldn't<00:05:34.780> really<00:05:34.990> just<00:05:35.289> start<00:05:35.590> off<00:05:35.800> they

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
shouldn't really just start off they

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.890 
shouldn't really just start off they
should<00:05:36.250> kind<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.120> meet<00:05:37.270> each<00:05:37.389> other<00:05:37.599> in<00:05:37.690> the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
should kind of meet each other in the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.350 
should kind of meet each other in the
midst<00:05:38.260> of<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.500> zombies<00:05:38.860> apocalypse<00:05:39.460> so<00:05:40.180> yeah
