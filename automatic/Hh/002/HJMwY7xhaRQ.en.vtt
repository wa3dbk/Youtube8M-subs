00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
allowing prosperity to flow and what I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.349 
allowing prosperity to flow and what I
mean<00:01:52.079> by<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> certain

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
mean by that is that there is a certain

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.429 
mean by that is that there is a certain
posture<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.240> Kriya<00:01:57.749> this

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
posture for this for this Kriya this

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
posture for this for this Kriya this
meditative<00:01:58.979> Korea<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.990> thinking

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
meditative Korea and I was thinking

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.830 
meditative Korea and I was thinking
about<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> idea<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> posture<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.119> posture

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
about the idea of posture your posture

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.709 
about the idea of posture your posture
is<00:02:03.869> literally<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.340> hold<00:02:05.880> yourself<00:02:06.179> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is literally how you hold yourself in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.230 
is literally how you hold yourself in
the<00:02:06.869> world<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:08.460> a<00:02:08.550> training

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
the world and so there's a training

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.320 
the world and so there's a training
within<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.350> practice<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:12.120> will

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
within the practice of this that will

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.870 
within the practice of this that will
allow<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.170> hold<00:02:13.710> yourself<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.610> world

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
allow you to hold yourself in the world

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.860 
allow you to hold yourself in the world
that<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.990> actually<00:02:16.470> pretty<00:02:16.740> far<00:02:17.250> out

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
that is actually pretty far out

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.910 
that is actually pretty far out
and<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.409> is<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.599> stay<00:02:20.989> aligned<00:02:21.560> within

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and that is that you stay aligned within

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.280 
and that is that you stay aligned within

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
through it the interesting thing what

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.039 
through it the interesting thing what
yogi<00:03:39.980> bhajan<00:03:40.160> said<00:03:40.549> about<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.389> that<00:03:41.450> it

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
yogi bhajan said about this is that it

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.580 
yogi bhajan said about this is that it
brings<00:03:42.379> you<00:03:42.620> beyond<00:03:43.250> duality<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.410> live

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
brings you beyond duality know we live

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.830 
brings you beyond duality know we live
in<00:03:45.650> polarity<00:03:46.340> we're<00:03:46.579> always<00:03:46.730> resolving<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
in polarity we're always resolving the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.659 
in polarity we're always resolving the
polarity<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.790> masculine<00:03:49.790> feminine<00:03:50.269> day<00:03:50.989> night

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
polarity of masculine feminine day night

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.720 
polarity of masculine feminine day night
but<00:03:52.669> there's<00:03:53.329> but<00:03:54.260> duality<00:03:54.949> is<00:03:55.069> another<00:03:55.459> thing

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
but there's but duality is another thing

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.150 
but there's but duality is another thing
that<00:03:55.790> actually<00:03:56.569> is<00:03:56.810> even<00:03:57.560> though<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:57.889> think

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that actually is even though we think

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.270 
that actually is even though we think
it's<00:03:58.340> part<00:03:58.609> of<00:03:58.699> polarity<00:03:59.449> you<00:04:00.379> can<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.859> keeps

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it's part of polarity you can it keeps

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.479 
it's part of polarity you can it keeps
you<00:04:01.489> from<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:01.970> resolution<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:03.199> and<00:04:03.799> the

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
you from that resolution of and the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.150 
you from that resolution of and the
resistance<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.389> have<00:04:05.660> for<00:04:06.500> living<00:04:06.980> in

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
resistance you have for living in

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000 
resistance you have for living in
polarity<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.319> great<00:04:09.680> thing<00:04:09.709> about

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
polarity and so the great thing about

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.580 
polarity and so the great thing about
the<00:04:10.340> 25th<00:04:10.910> priority<00:04:11.419> anyways<00:04:12.049> as<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.349> brings

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
the 25th priority anyways as it brings

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.460 
the 25th priority anyways as it brings
wealth<00:04:12.829> it<00:04:13.160> brings<00:04:13.370> prosperity<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:14.359> how<00:04:15.319> it

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
wealth it brings prosperity is how it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.580 
wealth it brings prosperity is how it
does<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.739> is<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.459> for

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
does that is it for

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.340 
does that is it for
duality<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.359> combination<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:20.199> these

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
duality and so the combination of these

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.990 
duality and so the combination of these
two<00:04:20.410> things<00:04:21.419> coming<00:04:22.419> beyond<00:04:22.780> duality<00:04:23.110> and

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
two things coming beyond duality and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.390 
two things coming beyond duality and
using<00:04:25.000> this<00:04:25.150> meditation<00:04:25.720> which<00:04:26.650> brings<00:04:26.919> green

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
using this meditation which brings green

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.670
