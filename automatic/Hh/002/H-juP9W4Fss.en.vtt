00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
you can also do it with the controller
too<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.759> game<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.180> support<00:01:30.509> controller

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

too so this game will support controller
it<00:01:31.590> doesn't<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> lay<00:01:32.670> out

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it doesn't have it so you can lay out

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.200 
it doesn't have it so you can lay out
the<00:01:32.939> controls<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:34.040> hope<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.850> full<00:01:36.030> game

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the controls I hope when the full game

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
the controls I hope when the full game
officially<00:01:36.990> comes<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.220> make<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
officially comes out they will make it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
officially comes out they will make it
so<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.060> full<00:01:39.329> controls<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so that you will have full controls so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
so that you will have full controls so
we'll<00:01:40.590> hopefully<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.520> ahead<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.759> find<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we'll hopefully go ahead and find that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.039 
we'll hopefully go ahead and find that
out<00:01:42.240> eventually<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.560> let's<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.950> move<00:01:44.040> on

accuracy<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:55.069> have<00:02:55.280> ones<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:55.640> fast<00:02:55.879> reload

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
accuracy you have ones for fast reload

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.360 
accuracy you have ones for fast reload
which<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.599> greases<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.049> loading<00:02:57.319> time<00:02:57.470> or

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
which is greases to the loading time or

which is greases to the loading time or
you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> larger<00:02:59.090> magazine<00:02:59.540> so<00:02:59.750> you

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
you can have a larger magazine so you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.770 
you can have a larger magazine so you
can<00:02:59.989> actually<00:03:00.260> increase<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.859> ammo<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.780> then

can actually increase the ammo and then

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.360 
can actually increase the ammo and then
same<00:03:03.019> thing<00:03:03.260> for<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.890> more<00:03:04.069> range

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
same thing for you can have more range

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.250 
same thing for you can have more range
with<00:03:04.730> them<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.510> have<00:03:05.690> these<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:06.079> in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
with them and you can have these all in

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.440 
with them and you can have these all in
a<00:03:06.379> separate<00:03:07.069> preset<00:03:07.579> setting<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.209> want

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
a separate preset setting if you want

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.069 
a separate preset setting if you want
which<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.720> like<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.170> it's<00:03:09.440> very<00:03:09.590> convenient

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
which I like that it's very convenient

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
now basically you also have the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.849 
now basically you also have the
specialization<00:03:13.959> feature<00:03:14.959> which<00:03:15.530> gives<00:03:15.769> you

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
specialization feature which gives you

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.319 
specialization feature which gives you
different<00:03:16.010> things<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:16.880> one<00:03:17.090> where

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
different things like you have one where

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.509 
different things like you have one where
the<00:03:17.750> cursor<00:03:17.930> will<00:03:18.169> follow<00:03:18.380> enemy<00:03:18.799> vectors<00:03:19.160> who

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
the cursor will follow enemy vectors who

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.580 
the cursor will follow enemy vectors who
fly<00:03:20.239> behind<00:03:20.450> obstacles<00:03:21.109> for<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.319> short

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
fly behind obstacles for a short

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.860 
fly behind obstacles for a short
duration<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.669> have<00:03:22.819> also<00:03:23.150> ones<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.720> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
duration you have also ones like the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.650 
duration you have also ones like the
Ecklie<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.410> prism<00:03:25.040> yet<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.940> smooth<00:03:26.150> operator

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
Ecklie on prism yet the smooth operator

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.599 
Ecklie on prism yet the smooth operator
and<00:03:27.139> all<00:03:27.590> different<00:03:27.950> types<00:03:28.069> of<00:03:28.220> one<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.489> we're

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
and all different types of one so we're

those<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:37.600> wouldn't<00:05:38.600> even<00:05:38.660> mess<00:05:38.870> with<00:05:38.900> this

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
those I wouldn't even mess with this

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.560 
those I wouldn't even mess with this
game<00:05:39.350> but<00:05:40.070> otherwise<00:05:40.310> though<00:05:40.640> I<00:05:40.880> really<00:05:41.240> like

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
game but otherwise though I really like

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.680 
game but otherwise though I really like
it<00:05:42.490> just<00:05:43.490> hopefully<00:05:43.700> whenever<00:05:44.240> they<00:05:44.360> go<00:05:44.480> and

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
it just hopefully whenever they go and

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.750 
it just hopefully whenever they go and
do<00:05:44.840> come<00:05:45.080> out<00:05:45.200> with<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.530> actual<00:05:45.860> full<00:05:46.520> game

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
do come out with the actual full game

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.970 
do come out with the actual full game
they<00:05:47.510> release<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.230> you<00:05:48.290> can<00:05:48.440> actually<00:05:48.590> use

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
they release it so you can actually use

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.240 
they release it so you can actually use
full<00:05:49.550> controller<00:05:50.060> support<00:05:50.770> or<00:05:51.770> at<00:05:51.920> least<00:05:52.100> make

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
full controller support or at least make

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.680 
full controller support or at least make
it<00:05:52.310> so<00:05:52.520> you<00:05:52.580> can<00:05:52.730> customize<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.330> controls

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
it so you can customize the controls

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.140 
it so you can customize the controls
yourself<00:05:54.110> because<00:05:54.350> as<00:05:54.470> of<00:05:54.590> right<00:05:54.830> now<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:55.610> have

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
yourself because as of right now I have

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.670 
yourself because as of right now I have
not<00:05:56.360> seen<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:56.960> I've<00:05:57.080> even<00:05:57.200> looked<00:05:57.470> on<00:05:57.590> the

not seen and I've even looked on the
forms<00:05:57.980> right<00:05:58.130> now<00:05:58.280> there<00:05:58.550> is<00:05:58.700> no<00:05:58.940> way<00:05:59.210> of<00:05:59.240> you

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
forms right now there is no way of you

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.820 
forms right now there is no way of you
actually<00:05:59.750> being<00:06:00.410> able<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:01.820> uh<00:06:02.830> technically

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830

wow I thought for sure I was gonna wear
through<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.050> I<00:06:06.290> guess<00:06:07.280> I<00:06:07.400> didn't<00:06:07.670> oh<00:06:07.880> well

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.270 
anyway let's talk about another couple
features<00:06:11.990> real<00:06:12.380> quick<00:06:12.530> before<00:06:12.650> we<00:06:12.860> go<00:06:13.010> in<00:06:13.100> in

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
features real quick before we go in in

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.150 
features real quick before we go in in
the<00:06:13.310> video<00:06:13.670> so<00:06:14.360> you<00:06:14.420> can<00:06:14.690> actually<00:06:15.160> when

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
the video so you can actually when

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.560 
the video so you can actually when
holding<00:06:16.490> that<00:06:16.580> down<00:06:16.820> you<00:06:16.880> can<00:06:17.180> actually<00:06:17.450> enter

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
holding that down you can actually enter

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.600 
holding that down you can actually enter
into<00:06:17.780> a<00:06:17.900> first-person<00:06:18.350> mode<00:06:18.560> which<00:06:19.460> is

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
into a first-person mode which is

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.890 
into a first-person mode which is
actually<00:06:19.790> going<00:06:20.030> to<00:06:20.120> be<00:06:20.210> very<00:06:20.390> convenient

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
actually going to be very convenient
