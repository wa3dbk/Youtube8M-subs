when<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.520> building<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.540> protein<00:00:36.960> shake<00:00:37.200> or

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
when you're building a protein shake or

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.040 
when you're building a protein shake or
your<00:00:37.530> smoothie<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:39.120> should<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:39.660> carbs

your smoothie you should have some carbs
and<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.739> should<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.250> proteins<00:00:41.700> now

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
there's lots of ways to be creative I'm

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
there's lots of ways to be creative I'm
going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.270> mixing<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> banana

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
going to be mixing it with a banana

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to be mixing it with a banana
which<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> also<00:00:58.859> high<00:00:59.190> glycemic<00:00:59.460> such<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
which is also high glycemic such as the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.229 
which is also high glycemic such as the
sugar<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.890> chocolate<00:01:02.489> milk<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
sugar in the chocolate milk which is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
sugar in the chocolate milk which is
going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> spike<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.719> insulin<00:01:04.379> intentionally

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
going to spike my insulin intentionally

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
going to spike my insulin intentionally
which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> help<00:01:06.210> shuttle<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
which is going to help shuttle the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
which is going to help shuttle the
protein<00:01:07.320> powder<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.100> body<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.640> because

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
protein powder into my body just because

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.880 
protein powder into my body just because
I'm<00:01:09.630> putting<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> protein<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.650> body

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
I'm putting the protein in my body

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
I'm putting the protein in my body
doesn't<00:01:11.159> mean<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.090> into

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
doesn't mean it's actually going into

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
doesn't mean it's actually going into
the<00:01:12.420> muscles<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> importance<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the muscles that's the importance of the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.179 
the muscles that's the importance of the
insulin<00:01:14.820> before<00:01:15.570> actually<00:01:16.259> mix<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
insulin before actually mix this up and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
insulin before actually mix this up and
drink<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.790> want<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.869> some<00:01:19.020> comments

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
drink it I want to make some comments

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.280 
drink it I want to make some comments
regarding<00:01:19.530> fat<00:01:19.979> loss<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:21.750> simple<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
regarding fat loss it's very simple to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
regarding fat loss it's very simple to
manipulate<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.340> fat<00:01:23.549> loss<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
manipulate this for fat loss you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.460 
manipulate this for fat loss you
basically<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.780> rid<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> sugars

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
basically want to get rid of the sugars

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.640 
basically want to get rid of the sugars
if<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.869> rid<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> banana<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
if you take get rid of the banana the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
if you take get rid of the banana the
chocolate<00:01:29.130> milk<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.180> keep<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
chocolate milk and you just keep the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
chocolate milk and you just keep the
protein<00:01:30.930> powder<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.040> water<00:01:32.280> you're

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
protein powder and the water you're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090 
protein powder and the water you're
going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.710> protein<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
going to have protein that's going to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to have protein that's going to
help<00:01:35.189> maintain<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.729> muscle<00:01:36.210> mass<00:01:36.299> it's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
remember the facts going to come off

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
remember the facts going to come off
from<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> caloric<00:01:40.530> deficit<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.220> create<00:01:41.640> from

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
from the caloric deficit you create from

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
from the caloric deficit you create from
your<00:01:42.210> meal<00:01:42.360> plan<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.960> well<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> hormonal

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
your meal plan as well as the hormonal

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.620 
your meal plan as well as the hormonal
response<00:01:44.880> we're<00:01:45.060> creating<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
response we're creating from the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.010 
response we're creating from the
high-resistance<00:01:45.810> weight<00:01:46.439> training<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:48.020> it's

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
high-resistance weight training so it's

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
high-resistance weight training so it's
a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.200> boring<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.829> sometimes<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
a little boring but sometimes this is

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
a little boring but sometimes this is
what<00:01:50.909> gets<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> job<00:01:51.390> done<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.649> an

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
what gets the job done if you're an

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
what gets the job done if you're an
advanced<00:01:53.040> guy<00:01:53.579> who's<00:01:53.880> trying<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> burn<00:01:54.270> off

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
advanced guy who's trying to burn off

advanced guy who's trying to burn off
the<00:01:54.659> last<00:01:54.810> couple<00:01:55.290> percent<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.860> body<00:01:56.040> fat<00:01:56.310> then

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
the last couple percent of body fat then

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
the last couple percent of body fat then
you<00:01:58.500> might<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.250> might<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.790> might<00:01:59.939> even

let<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:02.969> show<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.149> how<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> very

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
let me show you how we do this very

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.850 
let me show you how we do this very
simple

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.380 

I'm<00:02:11.860> aiming<00:02:12.219> for<00:02:12.400> about<00:02:12.609> a<00:02:12.819> two<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:13.239> ratio

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
I'm aiming for about a two to one ratio

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.649 
I'm aiming for about a two to one ratio
of<00:02:14.489> carbs<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.670> protein<00:02:18.299> that's<00:02:19.299> if<00:02:19.480> you're

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
of carbs to protein that's if you're

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.410 
of carbs to protein that's if you're
focusing<00:02:20.230> on<00:02:20.349> building<00:02:20.560> muscle<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:25.090> know<00:02:25.209> if

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
focusing on building muscle you know if

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.130 
focusing on building muscle you know if
you're<00:02:25.510> training<00:02:25.780> really<00:02:26.109> hard<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.900> need

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you're training really hard and you need

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.869 
you're training really hard and you need
to<00:02:29.319> keep<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.560> carbs<00:02:30.099> some<00:02:30.340> ectomorphs

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
to keep your carbs some ectomorphs

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.250 
to keep your carbs some ectomorphs
they're<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> have<00:02:31.329> to<00:02:31.480> keep<00:02:31.689> more<00:02:31.900> carbs

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
they're going to have to keep more carbs

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.500 
they're going to have to keep more carbs
in<00:02:32.379> their<00:02:32.500> body<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.010> their<00:02:33.430> program<00:02:34.209> even

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
in their body and their program even

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.059 
in their body and their program even
though<00:02:34.659> it's<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> fat<00:02:35.109> loss<00:02:35.319> program<00:02:35.799> which<00:02:35.950> is
