00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 this video shows a warm up that 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.970
 we are used to realize at 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 pole of chatenay as you can 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 see the players exchange a balloon 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.990
 taking as reference the lines 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.700
 nine meters hurdles of 3 m 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 the ball starts from nine meters to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.110
 to reach the 3 meters then of these same 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 three meters for the other geese matt 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 opponent to finish on the nine 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 opposing meters 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 such as this warming 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 the advantage of being very varied on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.449
 ball keys and strings 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 possible 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.449
 so it's very easy for 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 the coach to evolve this 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.470
 warming up respecting the principle 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.339
 evolution of the complexity of the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 load we calculate the evolutions 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.420
 so that the warm-up lasts on average 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.559
 20 minutes and finish always have this 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.559
 last by a contract 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 we
