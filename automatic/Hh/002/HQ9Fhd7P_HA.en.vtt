that<00:00:04.960> small<00:00:05.230> plastic<00:00:05.590> container<00:00:05.710> are<00:00:06.279> two

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
that small plastic container are two

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.509 
that small plastic container are two
metal<00:00:06.790> pushpins<00:00:07.420> and<00:00:07.660> they're<00:00:08.620> inserted<00:00:09.220> a

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 
metal pushpins and they're inserted a

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.510 
metal pushpins and they're inserted a
distance<00:00:10.330> that's<00:00:10.630> between<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.560> positive<00:00:12.340> and

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
distance that's between the positive and

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.030 
distance that's between the positive and
negative<00:00:12.790> lead<00:00:12.970> of<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.390> 9-volt<00:00:13.780> battery<00:00:14.230> so

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
negative lead of the 9-volt battery so

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.429 
negative lead of the 9-volt battery so
you<00:00:15.070> just<00:00:15.310> insert<00:00:15.640> them<00:00:15.790> in<00:00:15.910> there<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.439> make

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
you just insert them in there and make

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.170 
you just insert them in there and make
sure<00:00:17.470> that<00:00:17.859> they're<00:00:18.070> that<00:00:18.310> distance<00:00:18.820> apart

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
sure that they're that distance apart

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.630 
sure that they're that distance apart
and<00:00:19.390> that<00:00:20.260> should<00:00:20.440> be<00:00:20.530> fine

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.279 

in<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.970> container<00:00:26.300> is<00:00:26.660> going<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:26.960> be<00:00:27.050> some

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
in the container is going to be some

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.880 
in the container is going to be some
water<00:00:27.500> that<00:00:28.130> has<00:00:28.430> baking<00:00:29.029> soda<00:00:29.500> mixed<00:00:30.500> into<00:00:30.859> it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
water that has baking soda mixed into it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.160 
water that has baking soda mixed into it
the<00:00:31.220> baking<00:00:31.520> soda<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.540> water<00:00:32.570> allows

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
the baking soda in the water allows

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.710 
the baking soda in the water allows
electricity<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:33.980> flow<00:00:34.280> between<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.449> two

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
electricity to flow between the two

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.939 
electricity to flow between the two
metal<00:00:36.199> tips<00:00:36.949> of<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.850> pushpins<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.739> so<00:00:39.739> now

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
metal tips of the pushpins and so now

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.450 
metal tips of the pushpins and so now
you<00:00:40.010> set<00:00:40.489> them<00:00:40.610> on<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.970> leads<00:00:41.360> and<00:00:42.460> the

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
you set them on the leads and the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.549 
you set them on the leads and the
electricity<00:00:43.879> can<00:00:44.150> flow<00:00:44.180> between<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:45.350> two

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
electricity can flow between the two

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.590 
electricity can flow between the two
push<00:00:45.800> pins<00:00:46.070> now<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.030> electricity<00:00:47.390> is

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
push pins now and so electricity is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.170 
push pins now and so electricity is
flowing<00:00:47.809> through<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.410> water<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:48.949> so<00:00:49.610> that's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
flowing through the water and so that's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.380 
flowing through the water and so that's
enough<00:00:50.600> energy<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.019> break<00:00:51.800> apart<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.030> water

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
enough energy to break apart the water

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.990 
enough energy to break apart the water
make<00:00:54.019> it<00:00:54.050> undergo<00:00:54.409> chemical<00:00:54.589> reaction<00:00:55.309> so

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
make it undergo chemical reaction so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.439 
make it undergo chemical reaction so
that<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.780> h2o<00:00:57.230> gets<00:00:57.649> broken<00:00:58.010> apart<00:00:58.190> into<00:00:58.449> h2

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
that the h2o gets broken apart into h2

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.319 
that the h2o gets broken apart into h2
and<00:00:59.809> o2<00:01:00.289> it's<00:01:00.860> going<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.070> be<00:01:01.160> hydrogen<00:01:01.670> gas<00:01:02.000> and

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and o2 it's going to be hydrogen gas and

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.680 
and o2 it's going to be hydrogen gas and
oxygen<00:01:02.719> gas<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.879> both<00:01:04.879> gases<00:01:05.420> are<00:01:05.509> going<00:01:05.630> to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
oxygen gas and both gases are going to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.080 
oxygen gas and both gases are going to
flow<00:01:05.899> up<00:01:06.110> through<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.560> test<00:01:06.830> tubes<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.369> one

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
flow up through the test tubes and one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.340 
flow up through the test tubes and one
of<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.240> gases<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.630> going<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:08.990> one<00:01:09.140> test

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
of the gases is going to be in one test

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.960 
of the gases is going to be in one test
tube<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> other<00:01:10.340> one's<00:01:10.640> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.850> the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
tube and the other one's going to the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.249 
tube and the other one's going to the
other<00:01:11.060> one<00:01:11.240> how<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.780> know<00:01:11.840> which<00:01:11.990> one<00:01:12.170> is

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
other one how do you know which one is

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.499 
other one how do you know which one is
which<00:01:12.440> well<00:01:12.800> if<00:01:12.950> take<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.220> look<00:01:13.520> at<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.180> amount

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
which well if take a look at the amount

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.389 
which well if take a look at the amount
of<00:01:14.600> gas<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.110> each<00:01:15.229> test<00:01:15.530> tube<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:16.190> going<00:01:16.250> to

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
of gas in each test tube it's going to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.400 
of gas in each test tube it's going to
be<00:01:16.460> twice<00:01:16.700> as<00:01:16.970> much<00:01:17.119> hydrogen<00:01:17.539> gas<00:01:17.840> as<00:01:18.140> oxygen

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
be twice as much hydrogen gas as oxygen

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.990 
be twice as much hydrogen gas as oxygen
gas<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.100> see<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.460> right<00:01:19.670> test

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
gas so you can see in the right test

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.090 
gas so you can see in the right test
tube<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.750> twice<00:01:21.050> as<00:01:21.110> much<00:01:21.500> hydrogen<00:01:21.770> gas

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
tube you have twice as much hydrogen gas

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.190 
tube you have twice as much hydrogen gas
as<00:01:22.369> oxygen<00:01:22.700> gas<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.360> how<00:01:23.479> experimenters

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
as oxygen gas this is how experimenters

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.490 
as oxygen gas this is how experimenters
first<00:01:24.470> learn<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.090> ratio<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.570> hydrogen

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
first learn that the ratio of hydrogen

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.029 
first learn that the ratio of hydrogen
atoms<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.640> oxygen<00:01:29.030> atoms<00:01:29.149> in<00:01:29.479> water<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.380> two<00:01:30.920> to

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
atoms to oxygen atoms in water is two to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.080 
atoms to oxygen atoms in water is two to
one<00:01:31.069> two<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.490> one<00:01:31.700> ratio

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
one two to one ratio

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.830 
one two to one ratio
thus<00:01:32.390> h2o

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.370 

you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 

now<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.189> another<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.580> can<00:01:47.700> show

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
now there's another way you can show

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.350 
now there's another way you can show
water<00:01:48.659> undergoing<00:01:49.590> electrolysis<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
water undergoing electrolysis you can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
water undergoing electrolysis you can
take<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.750> same<00:01:52.140> 9-volt<00:01:52.560> battery<00:01:52.890> hook<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.490> two

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
take the same 9-volt battery hook up two

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
take the same 9-volt battery hook up two
wires<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.619> end<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> two

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
wires to it and then the end of the two

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.120 
wires to it and then the end of the two
wires<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.790> put<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.659> attach<00:01:57.960> either<00:01:58.440> brass

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wires you put you attach either brass

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
wires you put you attach either brass
wires<00:01:59.580> or<00:01:59.970> copper<00:02:00.149> wires<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.600> don't<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
wires or copper wires I don't think it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.990 
wires or copper wires I don't think it
really<00:02:00.990> matters<00:02:01.259> too<00:02:01.680> much

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.450 

then<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.480> put<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.830> two<00:02:08.100> wires<00:02:08.399> into<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
then you put the two wires into a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.190 
then you put the two wires into a
solution<00:02:11.460> of<00:02:11.550> bromothymol<00:02:11.910> blue<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
solution of bromothymol blue and the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
solution of bromothymol blue and the
bromothymol<00:02:13.440> blue<00:02:13.830> solution<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.400> some

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
bromothymol blue solution is also some

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.550 
bromothymol blue solution is also some
salt<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> electricity<00:02:16.140> flowing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
salt so you get the electricity flowing

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440 
salt so you get the electricity flowing
through<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> water<00:02:17.040> much<00:02:17.190> easier<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
through the water much easier and you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.060 
through the water much easier and you
can<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.840> electricity<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.710> flying<00:02:19.890> between

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
can see electricity is flying between

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.830 
can see electricity is flying between
the<00:02:20.310> two<00:02:20.460> wires<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.330> bubbles

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the two wires and you have bubbles

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.660 
the two wires and you have bubbles
forming<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.980> oxygen<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
forming so that's the oxygen and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.720 
forming so that's the oxygen and
hydrogen<00:02:24.450> gas<00:02:24.720> forming<00:02:25.440> now<00:02:26.100> one<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
hydrogen gas forming now one of the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.340 
hydrogen gas forming now one of the
leads<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.590> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.890> produce<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:30.350> different

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
leads is going to produce a different

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.050 
leads is going to produce a different
color<00:02:31.740> there's<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.520> chemical

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
color there's going to be a chemical

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.290 
color there's going to be a chemical
reaction<00:02:33.300> happen<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.400> yellow<00:02:35.880> color

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
reaction happen so the yellow color

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.730 
reaction happen so the yellow color
indicates<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.850> hydrogen<00:02:38.850> ions<00:02:39.330> are<00:02:39.690> being

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
indicates that hydrogen ions are being

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.860 
indicates that hydrogen ions are being
produced<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.820> becoming<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.660> acidic

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
produced and that's becoming more acidic

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.230 
produced and that's becoming more acidic
because<00:02:43.170> bromothymol<00:02:43.560> blue<00:02:44.040> solution<00:02:44.610> turns

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
because bromothymol blue solution turns

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.160 
because bromothymol blue solution turns
to<00:02:45.860> yellowish<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.220> green<00:02:47.459> when<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
to yellowish and green when there is a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.410 
to yellowish and green when there is a
higher<00:02:49.410> amount<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.430> acid<00:02:50.850> there's<00:02:51.180> more

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
higher amount of acid there's more

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.180 
higher amount of acid there's more
hydrogen<00:02:51.870> ions<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.350> again<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.680> indicates

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
hydrogen ions so again this indicates

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.320 
hydrogen ions so again this indicates
that<00:02:53.280> give<00:02:53.550> there's<00:02:54.000> two<00:02:54.180> different

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
that give there's two different

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660 
that give there's two different
chemicals<00:02:54.780> be<00:02:54.900> made<00:02:55.080> hydrogen<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.920> oxygen

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
chemicals be made hydrogen and oxygen

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.910 
chemicals be made hydrogen and oxygen
gas
