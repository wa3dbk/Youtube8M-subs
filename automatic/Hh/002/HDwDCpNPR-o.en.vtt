00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
example in just a minute here we'll take

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
example in just a minute here we'll take
the<00:00:48.149> click<00:00:48.539> wheel<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.170> tapping<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the click wheel and by tapping on the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
the click wheel and by tapping on the
click<00:00:49.890> wheel<00:00:49.920> move<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> left

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
click wheel move over here to the left

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.549 
click wheel move over here to the left
and<00:00:52.670> there's<00:00:53.670> our<00:00:53.910> crime<00:00:54.239> scene<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.350> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
and there's our crime scene and so then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
and there's our crime scene and so then
as<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.039> move<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> hand<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> crime

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
as you move the hand over the crime

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.849 
as you move the hand over the crime
scene<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:57.989> anything<00:00:58.230> worth<00:00:58.500> seeing

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
scene if there's anything worth seeing

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
scene if there's anything worth seeing
there'll<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> little<00:00:59.850> square<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> pops<00:01:00.510> up

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
there'll be a little square that pops up

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.609 
there'll be a little square that pops up
you<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:02.030> hit<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.270> center<00:01:03.719> button<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.199> take

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you then hit your center button and take

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
you then hit your center button and take
a<00:01:04.650> closer<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.549> what's<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
a closer look at what's going on in that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.010 
a closer look at what's going on in that
area<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.950> scene<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> again<00:01:09.090> probably<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
area of the scene and again probably the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.929 
area of the scene and again probably the
most<00:01:10.500> unfortunate<00:01:10.950> part<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> game

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
most unfortunate part about the game

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
most unfortunate part about the game
beyond<00:01:12.600> being<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.110> tedious<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> fun<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
beyond being a bit tedious it is fun to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.789 
beyond being a bit tedious it is fun to
try<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> put<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> pieces<00:01:15.509> together<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
try to put the pieces together of the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.820 
try to put the pieces together of the
puzzle<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.490> happened<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.830> you're

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
puzzle of what happened but you're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
puzzle of what happened but you're
putting<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.250> together<00:01:20.430> by<00:01:20.970> basically<00:01:21.630> doing

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
putting them together by basically doing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
putting them together by basically doing
what<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> tells<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.950> there's<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
what it tells you to do there's not a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
what it tells you to do there's not a
lot<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.810> exploration<00:01:24.810> involved<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
lot of exploration involved there are

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.109 
lot of exploration involved there are
some<00:01:25.740> minigames<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:26.850> bit

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
some minigames when you get a little bit

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
some minigames when you get a little bit
further<00:01:27.360> we'll<00:01:27.630> see<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> those<00:01:28.259> but

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
further we'll see one of those but

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
further we'll see one of those but
overall<00:01:29.700> you're<00:01:30.000> basically<00:01:30.479> being<00:01:30.689> told<00:01:30.900> what

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
overall you're basically being told what

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
overall you're basically being told what
to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.420> obviously<00:01:33.420> you'd

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to do and then you do it obviously you'd

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
to do and then you do it obviously you'd
be<00:01:33.720> most<00:01:33.930> interested<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> game<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.950> you
