 show some exercises of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.400
 strengthening the body for those who pedal

 come on the first move is a 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.630
 arm flexion the idea of ​​this movement 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.200
 is to work the movement of pushing in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.000
 in tune with hip stabilization 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 the ball already generates a certain instability 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 in motion 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.580
 simulating in a certain way a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.019
 instability maybe a bidon and the idea

 is to strengthen the musculature of the limbs 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.000
 activities in conjunction with the

 strengthening of the hip also of the core 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.750
 fundamental in this movement is the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.559
 alignment of the trunk with respect to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 the neutral position of the head and the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 symmetrical arms with respect to the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 90 degrees long also another movement

 essential for those who pedal 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.610
 of the leg with tron during the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.010
 tron slope maintenance of posture 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 which is always well activated for 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.280
 greatly strengthen the posterior chain 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.350
 of the body's special attention in this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 movement is not avoided the maximum 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 possible imbalance losing 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.590
 the posture is and maintenance of the waist 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.390

 and if that planet he leaves the hip 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.060
 always suspension and the idea is a movement 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.010
 of a squat with a
