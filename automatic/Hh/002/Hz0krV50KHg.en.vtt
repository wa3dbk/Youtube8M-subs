00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
one of these up basically you take the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.000 
one of these up basically you take the
top<00:01:29.580> off<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> has<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> piece<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.690> sandpaper

essentially right here on the top and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.230 
essentially right here on the top and
then<00:01:33.560> underneath<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:35.220> you've<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.670> pretty

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
then underneath that you've got pretty

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
much what amounts to a match head and if

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
much what amounts to a match head and if
you<00:01:39.210> strike<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> it'll<00:01:40.350> light<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:43.610> we've

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you strike that it'll light it up we've

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.150 
you strike that it'll light it up we've
got<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.940> lit<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:48.080> once<00:01:49.080> that's<00:01:49.290> lit<00:01:49.619> if

fire going you don't have to let this go
to<00:01:55.830> waste<00:01:56.090> what<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> basically

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
to waste what you do is you basically

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.190 
to waste what you do is you basically

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
beginning part of it with the harder

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
beginning part of it with the harder
hold<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.750> down<00:02:06.930> there

thank you second there we go
now<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.290> burnt<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.840> stamp

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
now that's burnt out we can just stamp

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.330 
now that's burnt out we can just stamp
it<00:02:27.959> right<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> first<00:02:37.440> inch

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it right there we go so the first inch

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.559 
it right there we go so the first inch
or<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.120> flare<00:02:39.500> has<00:02:43.100> some<00:02:44.569> additional

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
or so of the flare has some additional

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.680 
or so of the flare has some additional
magnesium<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.670> phosphorus<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
magnesium and phosphorus in there that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.920 
magnesium and phosphorus in there that
burns<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.640> little<00:02:50.640> hotter<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.060> harder<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
burns a little hotter and harder it's a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.150 
burns a little hotter and harder it's a
little<00:02:52.140> bit<00:02:52.230> harder<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.530> put<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.769> you'll<00:02:52.980> see

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
little bit harder to put out you'll see

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860 
little bit harder to put out you'll see
here<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> second<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.790> when<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.569> do<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
here in a second that when you do this a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.140 
here in a second that when you do this a
second<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.350> third<00:02:55.440> time<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:56.610> actually<00:02:57.000> isn't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
second and third time it actually isn't

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.240 
second and third time it actually isn't
that<00:02:57.360> difficult<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> put<00:02:57.959> out<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.920> kind<00:02:59.190> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
that difficult to put out so kind of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.699 
that difficult to put out so kind of
expect<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.850> first<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.140> first<00:03:01.380> time

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
expect that on first on the first time

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.340 
expect that on first on the first time
when<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.370> put<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.610> out<00:03:03.170> okay<00:03:04.170> so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
when you when you put it out okay so

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.190 
when you when you put it out okay so
we've<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.549> all<00:03:05.610> out<00:03:05.959> now<00:03:06.959> we're<00:03:07.110> gonna

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
just light the paper you don't have to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.390 
just light the paper you don't have to
worry<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.570> anything<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.200> inside<00:04:01.400> it's

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
worry about anything on the inside it's

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.509 
worry about anything on the inside it's
actually<00:04:02.730> pretty<00:04:02.940> difficult<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.600> relight<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
actually pretty difficult to relight the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.930 
actually pretty difficult to relight the
interior<00:04:06.680> portions<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.340> kind<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.640> just<00:04:08.790> hold

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
interior portions so kind of just hold

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.090 
interior portions so kind of just hold
it<00:04:09.090> toward<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.359> flame<00:04:09.630> kind<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.440> goes<00:04:10.590> back<00:04:10.620> up

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
it toward the flame kind of goes back up

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.699 
it toward the flame kind of goes back up
into<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.329> flare<00:04:12.569> make<00:04:13.140> sure<00:04:13.290> you're<00:04:13.440> pointing

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
into the flare make sure you're pointing

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.170 
into the flare make sure you're pointing
it<00:04:13.739> away<00:04:13.950> from<00:04:14.160> yourself<00:04:14.310> obviously<00:04:15.030> make

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
it away from yourself obviously make

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.779 
it away from yourself obviously make
sure<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.540> gloves<00:04:15.630> on<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.519> then<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.700> in

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
sure you have gloves on and then here in

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.849 
sure you have gloves on and then here in
a<00:04:17.850> second<00:04:18.269> it'll<00:04:18.930> get<00:04:19.049> hot<00:04:19.200> enough<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.650> it'll

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
a second it'll get hot enough and it'll

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.129 
a second it'll get hot enough and it'll
start<00:04:20.039> back<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:23.250> takes<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.580> little<00:04:23.700> bit

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
start back up it takes a little bit

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:33.070 
start back up it takes a little bit
again<00:04:25.139> there<00:04:25.289> are<00:04:25.380> safety<00:04:25.710> flares
