00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609 
image I think like the craigslist app
has<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.300> image<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> also<00:00:22.380> has<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
has like an image and then it also has a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200 
has like an image and then it also has a
description<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> craigslist<00:00:24.150> thing

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
is so a lot of functionality can happen

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.490

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
defaults that comes with the template

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.940 
defaults that comes with the template
which<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> circle<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.210> first

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
which would just be the circle for first

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
which would just be the circle for first
you<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.220> drop<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.939> own<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you could also drop in your own like the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
you could also drop in your own like the
my<00:01:10.439> bring<00:01:10.680> back<00:01:10.860> arrows<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.610> threw<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
my bring back arrows we threw those in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
my bring back arrows we threw those in
for<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.710> tutorial

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
for I think like the very first tutorial

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280 
for I think like the very first tutorial
something<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.140> we

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
something like that so you can see we

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
something like that so you can see we
can<00:01:16.409> quickly<00:01:16.799> add<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.150> details

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
can quickly add some cool little details

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
can quickly add some cool little details
to<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:19.020> application<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.740> make<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> very<00:01:20.280> you

go<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.740> imaged<00:01:35.130> fact<00:01:35.670> there

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
go with that little imaged fact there

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
go with that little imaged fact there
that<00:01:36.119> i'm<00:01:36.210> showing<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> click

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that i'm showing you is when you click

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.149 
that i'm showing you is when you click
the<00:01:38.009> cell<00:01:39.170> originally<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> style<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the cell originally we have the style is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
the cell originally we have the style is
a<00:01:41.250> custom<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> laos

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
a custom and that's going to be the laos

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
a custom and that's going to be the laos
to<00:01:42.990> programmatically<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> cell<00:01:45.119> look

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to programmatically make the cell look

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.969 
to programmatically make the cell look
whatever<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.380> throw<00:01:46.530> maybe<00:01:46.799> an

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
whatever or we could throw maybe an

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
whatever or we could throw maybe an
imageview<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> label<00:01:48.960> being

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
imageview in there and and a label being

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139 
imageview in there and and a label being
see<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.829> don't<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.189> an<00:01:50.310> option<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:50.850> image

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
see we don't have an option for an image

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.840 
see we don't have an option for an image
within<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.720> custom<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.979> i<00:01:53.040> mean<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
within the custom so i mean if you go to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
within the custom so i mean if you go to
basic<00:01:54.119> you'll<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.960> right<00:01:55.259> away<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.649> get

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
basic you'll see that right away we get

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.460 
basic you'll see that right away we get
a<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.189> get

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
a we get

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.520 
a we get
the<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:57.520> get<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.730> option<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.300> an<00:01:58.390> image<00:01:58.660> if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
the we get the option for an image if

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.580 
the we get the option for an image if
you<00:01:59.620> go<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.800> left<00:02:00.070> details<00:02:00.460> same<00:02:00.850> thing<00:02:01.590> we

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
you go to left details same thing we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.800 
you go to left details same thing we
lose<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:02.980> because<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.880> isn't<00:02:04.180> programmed<00:02:04.600> in

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
lose that because it isn't programmed in

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.740 
lose that because it isn't programmed in
for<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:05.800> make<00:02:06.130> sure<00:02:06.160> with<00:02:06.640> what<00:02:06.750> what

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
for you so make sure with what what

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.120 
for you so make sure with what what
you're<00:02:07.870> looking<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.770> what<00:02:09.009> you're

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
you're looking to do and what you're

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.430 
you're looking to do and what you're
looking<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.430> program<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.450> give<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.960> guess<00:02:11.260> you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
looking to program you give I guess you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960 
looking to program you give I guess you
select<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.950> right<00:02:12.070> style<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.730> want<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
select the right style that you want to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.720 
select the right style that you want to
associate<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.980> allow<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.040> image<00:02:15.520> to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
associate with and allow that image to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.290 
associate with and allow that image to
be<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> place<00:02:16.260> placeholder<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
be a place placeholder for you so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.640 
be a place placeholder for you so
anyways<00:02:19.300> if<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.960> don't<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.500> up<00:02:20.620> there

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
anyways if you don't see it up there

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
anyways if you don't see it up there
that's<00:02:20.980> probably<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> reason<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.090> some<00:02:22.360> of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
that's probably the reason that some of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.270 
that's probably the reason that some of
them<00:02:22.570> don't<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.230> don't<00:02:23.470> have<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.860> assigned

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
them don't and don't have that assigned

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.730 
them don't and don't have that assigned
to<00:02:24.550> them<00:02:24.720> anyways<00:02:25.720> hope<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.290> helps<00:02:26.470> you
