00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.950
 of expression of our condition 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.519
 because you have many thanks 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.519
 home 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:24.200
 and as well as that many many meanings of 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.850
 Transportation is always money always 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.850
 we go home 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.540
 Christopher Columbus took possession of these 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.540
 land 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.350
 do not 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.870
 and development 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.390
 it's still a demonstration 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.800
 without you we can not finish the movie myself 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.219
 you could not keep a little on the sidelines 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 from all of this 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.219
 Through time you will remember that water 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219
 He says 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 quite reasonable what they ask 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320
 it seems to me that a person who wins 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.180
 two dollars a day can not stand a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.250
 300% water price increase 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.200
 that's what they have told me that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.740
 you pay for the extras 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740
 yes 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.990
 and look the Indians in the eyes 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.569
 they do not have rational souls 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.930
 the government decrees the state of 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.930
 exception 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 they are only men 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.990
 perhaps you are not obligated to mothers like 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 to yourselves
