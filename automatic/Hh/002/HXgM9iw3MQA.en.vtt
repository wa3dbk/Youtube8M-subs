nice there

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:40.560 
nice there
you

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:55.810 

you

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:07.080 

it's<00:00:56.480> true<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:57.170> crave<00:00:57.680> you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:18.880 

ah

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.120 

you

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.380 

the<00:01:25.130> key<00:01:25.370> difference<00:01:25.400> i<00:01:25.850> noticed<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the key difference i noticed in the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.840 
the key difference i noticed in the
clutch<00:01:26.570> frame<00:01:26.810> was<00:01:27.260> gate<00:01:27.830> start<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
clutch frame was gate start it just it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.580 
clutch frame was gate start it just it
just<00:01:28.880> goes<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.720> know<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.840> didn't<00:01:30.290> know<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.470> it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
just goes you know I didn't know if it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.170 
just goes you know I didn't know if it
was<00:01:30.650> me<00:01:30.890> or<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.160> it<00:01:31.280> was<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.580> biker<00:01:31.760> what<00:01:32.060> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
was me or if it was the biker what it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.490 
was me or if it was the biker what it
was<00:01:32.360> corporate<00:01:33.260> roll<00:01:34.570> out<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.020> red<00:01:36.050> bull

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
was corporate roll out the red bull

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500 
was corporate roll out the red bull
helmet<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.250> wider<00:01:37.490> bottom<00:01:37.850> bracket<00:01:38.210> where<00:01:38.360> we

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
helmet a wider bottom bracket where we

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.960 
helmet a wider bottom bracket where we
run<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.720> wider<00:01:39.050> down<00:01:39.740> tube<00:01:40.040> into<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.820> then

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
run a wider down tube into it and then

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.960 
run a wider down tube into it and then
wider<00:01:41.590> chainstays<00:01:42.590> increases<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.670> strength

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
wider chainstays increases the strength

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.630 
wider chainstays increases the strength
and<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.540> stiffness<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> frame<00:01:45.740> where<00:01:46.010> you

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
and the stiffness of the frame where you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.460 
and the stiffness of the frame where you
could<00:01:46.790> just<00:01:46.910> put<00:01:47.510> more<00:01:47.690> power<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.170> pedals

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
could just put more power to the pedals

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.590 
could just put more power to the pedals
and<00:01:48.710> obviously<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.430> back<00:01:50.090> wheel<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.450> get

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
and obviously to the back wheel to get

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.510 
and obviously to the back wheel to get
moving<00:01:50.750> faster<00:01:51.230> react<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.770> allows<00:01:52.040> us<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
moving faster react that allows us to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.610 
moving faster react that allows us to
shape<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.000> form<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.360> carbon<00:01:53.690> fiber<00:01:53.900> around

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
shape and form the carbon fiber around

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.890 
shape and form the carbon fiber around
the<00:01:54.860> whole<00:01:55.070> bottom<00:01:55.460> bracket<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.120> utilize<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
the whole bottom bracket and utilize the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.990 
the whole bottom bracket and utilize the
entire<00:01:57.230> width<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.770> bottom<00:01:58.070> bracket<00:01:58.550> to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
entire width of the bottom bracket to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:12.000 
entire width of the bottom bracket to
make<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> very<00:01:59.630> stiff<00:02:00.430> efficient<00:02:01.430> bike

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.740 

and<00:02:13.010> what<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.760> our<00:02:14.000> own<00:02:14.300> proprietary

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and what that is is our own proprietary

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
and what that is is our own proprietary
blend<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.650> tea<00:02:16.130> 700nm<00:02:16.970> 30s<00:02:18.069> now<00:02:19.069> once<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.489> have

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
blend of tea 700nm 30s now once we have

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.370 
blend of tea 700nm 30s now once we have
we<00:02:20.030> actually<00:02:20.239> moved<00:02:20.810> all<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.140> these

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
we actually moved all of these

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.680 
we actually moved all of these
technologies<00:02:21.800> onto<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> alloy<00:02:23.030> platform<00:02:23.540> as

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
technologies onto the alloy platform as

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.270 
technologies onto the alloy platform as
well<00:02:24.520> utilizing<00:02:25.520> 7000<00:02:26.270> series<00:02:26.480> aluminum<00:02:27.280> we

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
well utilizing 7000 series aluminum we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.190 
well utilizing 7000 series aluminum we
gave<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.670> same<00:02:28.880> power<00:02:29.180> transfer<00:02:29.780> center

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
gave it the same power transfer center

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.680 
gave it the same power transfer center
think<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.530> smooth<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.160> by<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.730> PTC<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
think so smooth is out by the PTC on the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.720 
think so smooth is out by the PTC on the
on<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.380> clutch<00:02:33.620> frame<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.580> just

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
on the clutch frame is it's just

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.190 
on the clutch frame is it's just
delivers<00:02:35.300> your<00:02:35.420> power<00:02:35.600> straight<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
delivers your power straight to the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.320 
delivers your power straight to the
pedals<00:02:36.560> there's<00:02:36.800> there's<00:02:37.280> no<00:02:37.489> delay<00:02:37.819> nothing

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
pedals there's there's no delay nothing

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.320 
pedals there's there's no delay nothing
no<00:02:38.510> flex<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.050> frame<00:02:39.319> it's<00:02:40.330> instant

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
no flex in the frame it's instant

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.540 
no flex in the frame it's instant
straight<00:02:41.599> into<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> wheel

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.000 

this<00:02:48.150> bike<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.540> comes<00:02:49.320> out<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.890> much

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this bike it just comes out so much

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
this bike it just comes out so much
faster<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.030> straighter<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.450> doesn't

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
faster you know it straighter it doesn't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.630 
faster you know it straighter it doesn't
it<00:02:51.870> doesn't<00:02:51.900> flex<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.310> goes

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.750
