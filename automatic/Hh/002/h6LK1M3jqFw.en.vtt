my<00:02:20.530> very<00:02:20.770> first<00:02:21.100> one<00:02:21.450> made<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.630> easier<00:02:22.990> for<00:02:23.020> me

my very first one made it easier for me
the<00:02:23.350> next<00:02:23.560> time<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.800> thought<00:02:24.130> about<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.610> nurse

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
the next time I thought about that nurse

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.150 
the next time I thought about that nurse
and<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.660> decades<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> never<00:02:26.800> knew

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and I have for decades now I never knew

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.340 
and I have for decades now I never knew
her<00:02:27.340> name<00:02:27.520> but<00:02:28.300> she<00:02:28.510> really<00:02:28.810> taught<00:02:29.080> me<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
her name but she really taught me the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.010 
her name but she really taught me the
essence<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.860> caregiving<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.600> think<00:02:31.720> one

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
essence of caregiving and so I think one

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.559 
essence of caregiving and so I think one
of<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.260> ways<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.739> which<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:33.160> overcome<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.910> is

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
of the ways in which we overcome that is

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.809 
of the ways in which we overcome that is
seeing<00:02:34.900> others<00:02:35.140> do<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.980> realizing<00:02:36.760> you

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
seeing others do that and realizing you

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.300 
seeing others do that and realizing you
know<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.600> patient<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.319> could<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.650> me<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.160> I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
know that patient that could be me and I

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
know that patient that could be me and I
would<00:02:39.550> want<00:02:39.790> someone<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.569> get<00:02:40.720> beyond<00:02:41.050> their

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
would want someone to get beyond their

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.710 
would want someone to get beyond their
disgust<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.709> help<00:02:41.830> take<00:02:41.980> care<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.340> me<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.720> good
