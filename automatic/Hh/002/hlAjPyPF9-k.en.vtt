only<00:02:15.550> thing<00:02:15.970> that's<00:02:16.210> kind<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.450> odd<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:17.080> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
only thing that's kind of odd is that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.110 
only thing that's kind of odd is that
their<00:02:17.380> legs<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.830> fused<00:02:18.100> together<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.880> I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
their legs are fused together but I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.670 
their legs are fused together but I
think<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.960> confetti<00:02:20.410> will

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
think that so the confetti will

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.280 
think that so the confetti will
circulate<00:02:20.950> better<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:22.450> me<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.870> star<00:02:23.140> of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
circulate better and for me the star of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.550 
circulate better and for me the star of
the<00:02:23.440> set<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:24.040> diamond<00:02:24.640> mint<00:02:25.000> who<00:02:25.270> is
