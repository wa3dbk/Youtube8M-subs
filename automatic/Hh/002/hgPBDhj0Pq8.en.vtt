poni is a lot of balance you need to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
poni is a lot of balance you need to
create<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.599> lot<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.959> distance<00:02:27.709> palin<00:02:28.219> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
create a lot of distance palin and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.360 
create a lot of distance palin and
control<00:02:28.909> of<00:02:29.299> what<00:02:29.540> situation<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.469> in<00:02:30.620> before

you pull the kick out so it's important
to<00:02:33.620> remember<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.549> practice<00:02:34.969> let<00:02:35.569> me

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
to remember that and practice let me

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.059 
to remember that and practice let me
show<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.840> how<00:02:36.139> to<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:36.409> little<00:02:36.560> bit<00:02:36.680> faster

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
show you how to do a little bit faster

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.530 
show you how to do a little bit faster
so<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> line<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:39.139> hand<00:02:39.439> up<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.709> this

so when you line the hand up like this

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.490 
so when you line the hand up like this
learning<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.689> understanding<00:02:42.230> where<00:02:42.409> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
learning to understanding where the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.119 
learning to understanding where the
honey<00:02:42.680> drop<00:02:43.159> then<00:02:43.579> kick<00:02:43.849> yeah<00:02:44.480> come<00:02:45.170> chop<00:02:45.739> then

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
here yeah kick that okay think of that

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.949 
here yeah kick that okay think of that
so<00:02:58.069> spend<00:02:58.579> little<00:02:58.730> time<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.419> understanding

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
so spend little time to understanding

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.920 
so spend little time to understanding
where<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.859> kick<00:03:01.099> coming<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.579> be<00:03:01.879> like<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.870> you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
where the kick coming in be like so you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.689 
where the kick coming in be like so you
know<00:03:03.199> how<00:03:03.469> to<00:03:03.530> move<00:03:03.859> in<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.069> kick<00:03:04.310> with

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:04.699 
know how to move in a kick with

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.490 
know how to move in a kick with
balancing<00:03:05.239> understanding<00:03:06.139> where<00:03:06.290> they<00:03:06.409> are

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
balancing understanding where they are

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.970 
balancing understanding where they are
all<00:03:07.159> this<00:03:07.430> movement<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.000> very<00:03:08.989> important<00:03:09.709> when

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
all this movement is very important when

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.500 
all this movement is very important when
you<00:03:10.099> work<00:03:10.250> with<00:03:10.280> two<00:03:10.549> person<00:03:11.030> to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
you work with two person to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.890 
you work with two person to
understanding<00:03:12.109> is<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:13.099> Han<00:03:13.549> Occupy<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
understanding is the Han Occupy on the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.379 
understanding is the Han Occupy on the
fund<00:03:15.199> and<00:03:15.409> then<00:03:15.859> below<00:03:16.219> you<00:03:16.609> can<00:03:16.760> usually<00:03:16.969> like

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
fund and then below you can usually like

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.319 
fund and then below you can usually like
to<00:03:17.510> work<00:03:17.750> while<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.799> feel<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.280> hand<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:20.120> you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
to work while you feel the hand that you

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.509 
to work while you feel the hand that you
grab<00:03:20.629> joven<00:03:21.169> in<00:03:21.319> real<00:03:21.530> life<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.370> can

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
grab joven in real life then you can

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.909 
grab joven in real life then you can
able<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.819> react<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.419> quickly<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.230> faster

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
able to react on it quickly and faster

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.189 
able to react on it quickly and faster
so<00:03:25.189> if<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> can<00:03:25.579> react<00:03:25.819> on<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:26.120> good<00:03:26.359> level

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
so if you can react on this good level

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.960 
so if you can react on this good level
free<00:03:27.409> is<00:03:27.650> very<00:03:27.859> simple<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.549> you've<00:03:28.819> got<00:03:28.939> a

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
free is very simple because you've got a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.390 
free is very simple because you've got a
lot<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.209> people<00:03:29.629> working<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.199> real<00:03:30.590> life<00:03:30.829> then

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
lot of people working in real life then

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.119 
lot of people working in real life then
you<00:03:31.519> can<00:03:31.669> react<00:03:32.000> faster<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.739> lot<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:34.009> do

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
you can react faster it's a lot to do

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.729 
you can react faster it's a lot to do
with<00:03:34.220> reaction<00:03:34.790> learn<00:03:35.239> about<00:03:35.419> reacting<00:03:35.930> to

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
with reaction learn about reacting to

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.280 
with reaction learn about reacting to
the<00:03:36.859> moment<00:03:37.280> instead<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.759> seeing<00:03:38.290> spend

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the moment instead of seeing spend

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.349 
the moment instead of seeing spend
little<00:03:39.500> time<00:03:39.680> with<00:03:40.069> your<00:03:40.220> partner<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:41.120> play
