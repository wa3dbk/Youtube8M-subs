section greens do not produce and let me
tell<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.110> reason<00:01:31.380> why<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.430> know

they<00:01:33.659> passed<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:35.509> okay<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.570> here's<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
they passed this okay so here's the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
they passed this okay so here's the
other<00:01:37.740> section<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.400> beans<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.119> see

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
other section of my beans as you can see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.420 
other section of my beans as you can see
here<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.869> trellis<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.100> top

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
here the trellis all the way on top

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.660 
here the trellis all the way on top
that's<00:01:42.420> over<00:01:42.840> eight<00:01:43.530> feet<00:01:43.590> tall<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that's over eight feet tall I'm a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's over eight feet tall I'm a
defense<00:01:45.060> line<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> wooden<00:01:45.869> fence<00:01:46.020> here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
defense line here the wooden fence here

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
defense line here the wooden fence here
you<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.189> six<00:01:47.490> feet<00:01:47.670> tall<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you see there that's six feet tall and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
you see there that's six feet tall and
on<00:01:49.110> top<00:01:49.380> there's<00:01:49.649> over<00:01:49.950> eight<00:01:50.100> feet<00:01:50.130> tall<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on top there's over eight feet tall and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.510 
on top there's over eight feet tall and
I<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.890> ten<00:01:53.220> plants

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I just can see I have about ten plants

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
I just can see I have about ten plants
here<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.829> foliage<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.399> beautiful<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.420> grow

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
here the foliage of beautiful they grow

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
here the foliage of beautiful they grow
very<00:01:57.920> vigorously<00:01:58.969> they<00:01:59.969> took<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.299> over<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
very vigorously they took it over the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.440 
very vigorously they took it over the
entire<00:02:00.689> trellis<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.390> see

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
entire trellis but as you can see

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.410 
entire trellis but as you can see
there's<00:02:04.110> no<00:02:04.290> flowers<00:02:04.710> there's<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.280> beans

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's no flowers there's no beans

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.150 
there's no flowers there's no beans
now<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:08.270> speculate<00:02:09.270> there's<00:02:09.569> something

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
now I speculate there's something

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.460 
now I speculate there's something
imbalance<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.660> foliage<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
imbalance here foliage and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
imbalance here foliage and
leaves<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.830> stem<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.940> produce<00:02:15.330> quite<00:02:15.570> well

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
leaves and stem that produce quite well

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.710 
leaves and stem that produce quite well
and<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:17.280> has<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:17.760> high<00:02:18.360> level

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
and that has to do with high level

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
and that has to do with high level
nitrogen<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:20.370> plant<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.790> need<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> lot<00:02:21.270> of

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
nitrogen the plant do need a lot of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.180 
nitrogen the plant do need a lot of
nitrogen<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:22.170> those<00:02:22.320> good<00:02:22.590> green<00:02:22.950> leaves

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
nitrogen with those good green leaves

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.980 
nitrogen with those good green leaves
and<00:02:23.820> stem<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:25.470> strong<00:02:25.770> leaves<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.250> stem<00:02:26.990> but

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
and stem for strong leaves and stem but

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.220 
and stem for strong leaves and stem but
if<00:02:28.140> too<00:02:28.320> much<00:02:28.440> nitrogen<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.940> plants<00:02:30.300> tend<00:02:30.900> to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
if too much nitrogen the plants tend to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.990 
if too much nitrogen the plants tend to
do<00:02:31.710> if<00:02:31.950> op<00:02:32.160> talents<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.690> tend<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:35.000> not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
do if op talents then that tend to not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.770 
do if op talents then that tend to not
produce<00:02:36.180> any<00:02:36.990> flowers<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.820> that's<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.720> think

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
produce any flowers and that's I think

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.830 
produce any flowers and that's I think
one<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.010> reason<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.670> think<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.690> was

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
one of the reason I think that it was

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.530 
one of the reason I think that it was
this<00:02:43.140> section<00:02:43.770> here<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.730> plant<00:02:45.000> grow<00:02:45.180> very

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
this section here the plant grow very

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.510 
this section here the plant grow very
well<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.110> beans<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.530> nice<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.310> green<00:02:47.490> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
well the beans are nice and green and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.920 
well the beans are nice and green and
luscious<00:02:48.270> green<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.530> no<00:02:49.740> flowers<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.600> that's

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
luscious green but no flowers so that's

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
luscious green but no flowers so that's
that's<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> trick<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.690> hopefully<00:02:55.130> as<00:02:56.130> I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that's the trick and hopefully as I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.540 
that's the trick and hopefully as I
continue<00:02:57.270> water<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:58.290> nitrogen<00:02:58.830> level<00:02:59.100> will

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
continue water the nitrogen level will

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.300 
continue water the nitrogen level will
kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.030> wash<00:03:00.300> away<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.570> little<00:03:00.750> bit<00:03:00.959> and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
kind of wash away a little bit and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.460 
kind of wash away a little bit and
eventually<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:02.430> will<00:03:02.580> produce<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.470> hopefully

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
eventually they will produce I hopefully

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.640 
eventually they will produce I hopefully
will<00:03:04.740> produce<00:03:05.630> but<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> know<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.230> they<00:03:07.440> kind

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
will produce but you know it's they kind

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.290 
will produce but you know it's they kind
of<00:03:07.709> come<00:03:07.950> low<00:03:08.100> light<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.910> see<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.180> my

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
of come low light as you can see in my

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.330 
of come low light as you can see in my
other<00:03:09.540> plants<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> other<00:03:10.770> section<00:03:11.160> there

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
other plants in the other section there

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.180 
other plants in the other section there
they<00:03:11.790> actually<00:03:12.390> will<00:03:13.230> grow<00:03:13.440> after<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:14.040> all

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
they actually will grow after that all

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.470 
they actually will grow after that all
the<00:03:14.310> skies<00:03:14.490> are<00:03:14.880> disguise<00:03:15.150> will<00:03:15.300> grow

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the skies are disguise will grow

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.000 
the skies are disguise will grow
actually<00:03:16.459> remain<00:03:17.480> almost<00:03:18.480> two<00:03:18.810> months

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
actually remain almost two months

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.560 
actually remain almost two months
running<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.310> two<00:03:20.820> months<00:03:21.090> already<00:03:21.209> and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
running like two months already and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.620 
running like two months already and
still<00:03:22.560> no<00:03:22.880> flowers<00:03:24.110> no<00:03:25.130> beans<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.540> there<00:03:27.540> is

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
still no flowers no beans and there is

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.509 
still no flowers no beans and there is
such<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> beautiful<00:03:28.440> plant<00:03:28.830> as<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.190> can<00:03:29.340> see

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
such a beautiful plant as you can see

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.030 
such a beautiful plant as you can see
here<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.060> base<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.170> beans<00:03:31.620> here<00:03:31.860> are

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
here the base of the beans here are

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.330 
here the base of the beans here are
really<00:03:32.519> thick<00:03:32.820> look<00:03:33.030> at<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.300> huge<00:03:34.250> look<00:03:35.250> at

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
really thick look at that huge look at

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.850 
really thick look at that huge look at
the<00:03:35.430> foliage<00:03:35.820> lush<00:03:36.209> beautiful<00:03:36.660> green<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.709> no

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
the foliage lush beautiful green but no

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.110 
the foliage lush beautiful green but no
beans<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.810> conclusion<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.860> think<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.670> has<00:03:41.970> to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
beans so conclusion I think that has to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.570 
beans so conclusion I think that has to
do<00:03:42.209> with<00:03:42.330> imbalance<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.140> nutrients<00:03:43.830> too<00:03:44.430> much

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
do with imbalance of nutrients too much

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.539 
do with imbalance of nutrients too much
nitrogen<00:03:45.620> maybe<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.830> enough<00:03:47.040> phosphorous

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
nitrogen maybe not enough phosphorous

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.850 
nitrogen maybe not enough phosphorous
not<00:03:47.790> enough<00:03:48.000> potassium<00:03:48.540> those<00:03:49.440> are<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> two

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
not enough potassium those are the two

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.340 
not enough potassium those are the two
also<00:03:50.190> two<00:03:50.250> macro<00:03:51.030> nutrients<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.200> need

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
also two macro nutrients that you need

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.190 
also two macro nutrients that you need
for<00:03:52.910> for<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.060> plants<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.480> produce<00:03:54.600> flowers

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
for for the plants to produce flowers

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.330 
for for the plants to produce flowers
and<00:03:55.560> good<00:03:56.100> fruits<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.780> think<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.870> do<00:03:58.080> sees<00:03:58.350> are

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
and good fruits I think I do sees are

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
and good fruits I think I do sees are
starting<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.880> flower<00:04:00.120> right<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:02.269> okay<00:04:03.269> so

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
starting to flower right there okay so

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.070 
starting to flower right there okay so
that<00:04:04.080> might<00:04:04.350> be<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:05.180> starting<00:04:06.180> point<00:04:06.239> once<00:04:06.840> it's

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
that might be a starting point once it's

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.110 
that might be a starting point once it's
produced<00:04:07.320> flower<00:04:07.739> they<00:04:08.070> well<00:04:08.310> produce<00:04:08.580> very

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
produced flower they well produce very

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.390 
produced flower they well produce very
well<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.320> tell<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:10.980> once<00:04:11.220> this

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
well and I can tell you that once this

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.190 
well and I can tell you that once this
nine<00:04:12.269> plants<00:04:12.630> produce<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
nine plants produce the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.659 
nine plants produce the
there'll<00:04:15.010> be<00:04:15.129> beans<00:04:15.730> everywhere<00:04:17.489> okay<00:04:18.489> well

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
there'll be beans everywhere okay well

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.969 
there'll be beans everywhere okay well

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
so even though this even this section

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.120 
so even though this even this section
right<00:04:36.370> here<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.000> grow<00:04:37.300> them<00:04:37.919> they<00:04:38.919> also

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
right here that I grow them they also

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.860 
right here that I grow them they also
put<00:04:39.430> these<00:04:39.550> as<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.389> see<00:04:40.570> here<00:04:40.750> the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
flower as you can see that the section

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.770 
flower as you can see that the section
would<00:04:44.530> was<00:04:45.100> kind<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.820> neglect<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.419> little<00:04:46.660> bit

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
would was kind of neglect a little bit

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.050 
would was kind of neglect a little bit
but<00:04:47.710> eventually<00:04:47.860> as<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.490> temperature<00:04:48.880> pick

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
but eventually as the temperature pick

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.510 
but eventually as the temperature pick
up<00:04:49.240> they<00:04:50.020> all<00:04:51.270> climbing<00:04:52.270> up<00:04:52.360> this<00:04:52.570> trellis<00:04:52.900> and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
up they all climbing up this trellis and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.370 
up they all climbing up this trellis and
I<00:04:54.520> do<00:04:54.580> see<00:04:54.970> some<00:04:55.150> flowers<00:04:55.539> and<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.870> do<00:04:55.930> Havas

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
I do see some flowers and I do Havas

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.560 
I do see some flowers and I do Havas
from<00:04:56.620> some<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.949> this<00:04:57.600> plants<00:04:58.600> ready<00:05:00.060> okay<00:05:01.060> so
