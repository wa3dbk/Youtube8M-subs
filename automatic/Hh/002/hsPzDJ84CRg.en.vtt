procedure<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.160> minimally<00:00:41.520> invasive

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
procedure it's minimally invasive

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.850 
procedure it's minimally invasive
basically<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.200> we're<00:00:43.350> doing<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.710> we're

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
basically what we're doing is we're

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.600 
basically what we're doing is we're
taking<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.910> minut<00:00:45.410> vacuum<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.219> will

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
taking the very minut vacuum that will

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.180 
taking the very minut vacuum that will
go<00:00:47.940> after<00:00:48.149> each<00:00:49.020> graft<00:00:49.760> take<00:00:50.760> each<00:00:50.969> graft<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
go after each graft take each graft and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.830 
go after each graft take each graft and
take<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.910> there's<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.600> two<00:00:54.629> or

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
take it so that there's one or two or

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.520 
take it so that there's one or two or
three<00:00:55.199> hair<00:00:55.440> follicles<00:00:56.010> within<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
three hair follicles within it and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
three hair follicles within it and
because<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.949> touched<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.780> same<00:01:01.020> way

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
because it's not touched in the same way

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
because it's not touched in the same way
as<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> traditional<00:01:01.829> method<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
as a traditional method there's a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170 
as a traditional method there's a
greater<00:01:03.600> chance<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.199> survivability<00:01:05.180> higher

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
greater chance of survivability higher

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
greater chance of survivability higher
than<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.780> strict<00:01:07.470> method<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.130> other

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
than with strict method and some other

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
than with strict method and some other
methods<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.150> well<00:01:09.740> also<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> heal<00:01:12.060> faster<00:01:12.689> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
back oh man as well so my hair right now

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.040 
back oh man as well so my hair right now
is<00:02:17.700> fairly<00:02:18.209> short<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
is fairly short it's actually the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.130 
is fairly short it's actually the
shortest<00:02:19.230> I've<00:02:19.500> ever<00:02:19.950> worn<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.140> the

shortest I've ever worn it and the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.369 
shortest I've ever worn it and the
reason<00:02:22.739> why<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.670> short<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.989> allows

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
reason why it's short is that it allows

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.220 
reason why it's short is that it allows
