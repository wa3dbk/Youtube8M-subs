00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
hey youtube today I'm going to show you

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.640 
hey youtube today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.740> use<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.219> computer<00:00:15.490> power<00:00:16.059> supply

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
how to use a computer power supply

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.170 
how to use a computer power supply
outside<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> computer<00:00:17.760> okay<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:20.180> right

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
outside of the computer okay so right

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.830 
outside of the computer okay so right
here<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.980> got<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.009> voltmeter<00:00:23.520> hooked<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
here I got a voltmeter hooked up to the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.249 
here I got a voltmeter hooked up to the
12<00:00:25.200> volt<00:00:25.259> wire<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.130> power<00:00:26.340> supply<00:00:27.259> the

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
12 volt wire on the power supply the

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.939 
12 volt wire on the power supply the
yellow<00:00:28.470> eyes<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.009> 12<00:00:29.279> volt<00:00:29.340> wire<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> pretty

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
yellow eyes the 12 volt wire so pretty

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.990 
yellow eyes the 12 volt wire so pretty
much<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:33.059> green<00:00:33.360> wire<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
much this green wire right here the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.290 
much this green wire right here the
spring<00:00:36.330> wire<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:37.470> normally<00:00:38.220> as<00:00:38.489> part<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
spring wire is normally as part of this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.920 
spring wire is normally as part of this
harness<00:00:39.809> main<00:00:40.620> harness<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.690> that's<00:00:42.690> where<00:00:42.900> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
harness main harness and that's where it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
harness main harness and that's where it
was<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.010> cut<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.460> off<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
was and I cut it off and all you have to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.969 
was and I cut it off and all you have to
do<00:00:47.519> is<00:00:47.790> this<00:00:48.030> green<00:00:48.390> wire<00:00:48.629> has<00:00:49.049> to<00:00:49.229> be<00:00:49.379> grounded

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
do is this green wire has to be grounded

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.549 
do is this green wire has to be grounded
and<00:00:50.339> as<00:00:50.850> long<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:51.449> stays<00:00:51.600> grounded<00:00:52.049> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and as long as it stays grounded the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.689 
and as long as it stays grounded the
partial<00:00:53.070> i'll<00:00:53.159> be<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> green<00:00:56.489> wire

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
partial i'll be on so this green wire

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.840 
partial i'll be on so this green wire
which<00:00:57.479> is<00:00:57.720> originally<00:00:58.309> right<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.549> on<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
which is originally right here on the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.090 
which is originally right here on the
main<00:01:00.030> harness<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.589> have<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.799> ground

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
main harness you just have to ground

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
main harness you just have to ground
that<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.449> why<00:01:03.629> i<00:01:03.659> have<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> hooked<00:01:04.409> up

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that so that's why i have it hooked up

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.850 
that so that's why i have it hooked up
to<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.979> switch<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.840> that's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.200> black

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to this switch and that's the black

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.990 
to this switch and that's the black
ground<00:01:08.159> wire<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.610> guys<00:01:11.790> can

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
ground wire so right now as you guys can

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.530 
ground wire so right now as you guys can
see<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.420> fan<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.790> spinning<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
see the fan is off it's not spinning and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.429 
see the fan is off it's not spinning and
there's<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.259> votes<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> ball<00:01:17.100> meter<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
there's your votes on the ball meter I

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.270 
there's your votes on the ball meter I
will<00:01:19.439> Graham<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> power<00:01:20.130> supply<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:21.650> will<00:01:22.650> run

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
will Graham the power supply I will run

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.070 
will Graham the power supply I will run
this<00:01:23.550> green<00:01:23.850> wire<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.300> now<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.570> prove<00:01:24.870> its

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this green wire right now to prove its

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350 
this green wire right now to prove its
you<00:01:25.200> guys

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.330 

okay<00:01:29.200> now<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.830> fans<00:01:30.190> started<00:01:30.670> spinning<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
okay now the fans started spinning and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.060 
okay now the fans started spinning and
the<00:01:33.370> volt<00:01:34.210> meter<00:01:34.270> shows<00:01:34.480> 12<00:01:35.020> volts<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:35.740> I'm

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
the volt meter shows 12 volts and I'm

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.670 
the volt meter shows 12 volts and I'm
pressing<00:01:36.610> down<00:01:36.760> on<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.150> switch<00:01:37.420> when<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.410> let

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
pressing down on the switch when I let

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.940 
pressing down on the switch when I let
go<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:39.640> want<00:01:39.880> me<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.150> read<00:01:40.330> zero<00:01:40.600> again<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
go that want me to read zero again and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.860 
go that want me to read zero again and
the<00:01:42.160> plan<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.460> stopped<00:01:43.000> spinning<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.600> once

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
the plan is stopped spinning so once

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.830 
the plan is stopped spinning so once
again<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.030> ground<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.570> green

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
again you just have to ground the green

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.770 
again you just have to ground the green
wire<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.670> long<00:01:51.910> as<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.240> stays<00:01:52.360> grounded

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
wire and as long as it stays grounded

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.430 
wire and as long as it stays grounded
the<00:01:53.200> power<00:01:53.440> supply<00:01:53.650> run<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:56.229> power

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the power supply run and this power

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.260 
the power supply run and this power
supply<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.940> yellow<00:01:58.300> wire<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.020> 12<00:01:59.620> volt<00:01:59.800> wire

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
supply the yellow wire is a 12 volt wire

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.320 
supply the yellow wire is a 12 volt wire
the<00:02:01.270> red<00:02:01.300> wires<00:02:01.780> are<00:02:02.110> five<00:02:02.380> volts<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.330> the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
the red wires are five volts and the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.190 
the red wires are five volts and the
orange<00:02:04.660> wires<00:02:04.930> are<00:02:05.200> 3.3<00:02:05.950> volts<00:02:06.960> black<00:02:07.960> wire

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
orange wires are 3.3 volts black wire

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.900 
orange wires are 3.3 volts black wire
ground<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.540> my<00:02:10.540> power<00:02:10.840> supply<00:02:10.959> has<00:02:11.890> 18<00:02:12.550> volts

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
ground so my power supply has 18 volts

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.870 
ground so my power supply has 18 volts
on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> 12<00:02:13.510> volt<00:02:13.600> line<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.190> pretty<00:02:15.430> much<00:02:15.520> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
on the 12 volt line so pretty much I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.120 
on the 12 volt line so pretty much I
could<00:02:16.120> easily<00:02:16.480> run<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.720> 200-watt<00:02:17.470> car<00:02:17.800> audio

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
could easily run a 200-watt car audio

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.690 
could easily run a 200-watt car audio
system<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.920> bit<00:02:21.070> i'll<00:02:21.489> be
