00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
for instance like I'm using my prison

for instance like I'm using my prison
server<00:00:35.250> build<00:00:35.579> permissions<00:00:36.090> file<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.320> if

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
server build permissions file here so if

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
server build permissions file here so if
I<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.710> type<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.129> tests<00:00:38.550> how<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I just type in tests how you get that to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650 
I just type in tests how you get that to
show<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> VIP

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
show up before or if you have like a VIP

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
show up before or if you have like a VIP
after<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.070> prefix<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.850> that's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
after so that's a prefix and then that's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.299 
after so that's a prefix and then that's
a<00:00:45.180> suffix<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.289> how<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.739> done<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a suffix so how that's done is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.110 
a suffix so how that's done is
previously<00:00:48.320> permissions<00:00:49.320> X<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.890> pecks<00:00:50.610> has

with their permissions file and then you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740 
with their permissions file and then you
just<00:00:56.730> enable<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.629> would

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just enable that and then it would

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090 
just enable that and then it would
automatically<00:00:58.199> grab<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> stuff<00:00:58.920> and

that it still works if you can find it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
that it still works if you can find it
but<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.170> directly<00:01:04.920> support<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.850> so

a really big server or like a town you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
a really big server or like a town you

anyway<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> chat<00:02:00.060> formatting<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> done<00:02:00.869> in

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
anyway the chat formatting is done in

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
anyway the chat formatting is done in
two<00:02:01.259> ways<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.850> global

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
two ways here you have your global

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
two ways here you have your global
format<00:02:03.960> which<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.549> group

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
format which is this or you can do group

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
format which is this or you can do group
formats<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.689> here<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.009> since<00:02:08.399> we

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
formats in here but you know since we

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
formats in here but you know since we
kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.970> handle<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> permissions

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
kind of handle it in the permissions

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.770 
kind of handle it in the permissions
files<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.129> don't<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:12.000> need<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
files I don't think we really need to to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
files I don't think we really need to to
denote<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.500> group

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
denote the group

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.450 
denote the group
formats<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:15.570> note<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.530> variable

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
formats I would note that this variable

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.270 
formats I would note that this variable
here<00:02:17.700> group<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.630> show<00:02:18.840> exactly<00:02:19.530> what

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
here group is going to show exactly what

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.180 
here group is going to show exactly what
your<00:02:20.550> permissions<00:02:21.180> file<00:02:21.480> shows<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.290> my<00:02:22.920> group

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
your permissions file shows so my group

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.600 
your permissions file shows so my group
for<00:02:23.220> B<00:02:23.580> prisoner<00:02:24.060> does<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.570> not<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.610> B

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
for B prisoner does is not be it's B

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.550 
for B prisoner does is not be it's B
prisoner<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.450> would<00:02:27.570> show<00:02:27.780> B<00:02:28.080> prisoner

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
prisoner so it would show B prisoner

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.760 
prisoner so it would show B prisoner

just going to save that and then we're

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.980 
just going to save that and then we're
going<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.020> reload<00:02:53.090> essentials<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.660> then

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
going to reload essentials here and then

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.760 
going to reload essentials here and then
we<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.350> test<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.790> making<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.420> change<00:02:57.870> over

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
we go test so making that change over

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.610 
we go test so making that change over
here<00:02:59.510> makes<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.810> everything<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.320> comes

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
here makes it so everything that comes

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
here makes it so everything that comes
after<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.490> that's<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.850> message

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
after that so that's the message

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.680 
after that so that's the message
come<00:03:04.620> makes<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.340> dark<00:03:05.640> gray<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.270> now<00:03:06.420> let's

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
come makes that dark gray so now let's

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
come makes that dark gray so now let's
say<00:03:06.810> we<00:03:06.960> want<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.230> change<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.980> username<00:03:08.340> as

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
say we want to change the username as

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330 
say we want to change the username as
well<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.990> dark<00:03:10.290> grade<00:03:10.710> now<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:10.980> can't

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
well to be that dark grade now we can't

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.640 
well to be that dark grade now we can't
do<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.540> essentials<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.350> because

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
do that in the essentials here because

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
do that in the essentials here because
if<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:13.950> put<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.490> here<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.420> colors

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
if we put it right here and the colors

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.830 
if we put it right here and the colors
are<00:03:15.930> read<00:03:16.350> from<00:03:16.380> left<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.280> so

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
are read from left to right so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.540 
are read from left to right so
everything<00:03:18.840> after<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.590> color<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.490> to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
everything after this color is going to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.820 
everything after this color is going to
be<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.850> color<00:03:21.090> until<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.780> meets<00:03:22.350> another

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
be that color until it meets another

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.740 
be that color until it meets another
color<00:03:23.220> change<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:23.880> we<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> color<00:03:24.450> change

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
color change so if we do a color change

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.750 
color change so if we do a color change
here<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:25.350> soon<00:03:25.860> as<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.010> gets<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> display

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
here as soon as it gets in the display

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.360 
here as soon as it gets in the display
main<00:03:27.000> name<00:03:27.420> it's<00:03:28.230> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> hit<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.010> color

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
main name it's going to hit this color

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.270 
main name it's going to hit this color
right<00:03:29.670> here<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.040> change

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
right here and then it's going to change

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.010 
right here and then it's going to change
back<00:03:32.490> it's<00:03:33.090> going<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.480> whatever<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.900> is

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
back it's going to be whatever it is

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.570 
back it's going to be whatever it is
it's<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.680> care<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.400> did

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
is all going to be grouped into this one

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.160 
is all going to be grouped into this one
area<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.420> we're<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> open<00:03:48.720> up<00:03:49.020> our

permissions file here and find too far
down<00:03:53.700> too<00:03:53.970> far<00:03:54.209> down<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:55.620> guard<00:03:55.860> here<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.310> go

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
down too far down see guard here we go

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.300 
down too far down see guard here we go
where<00:03:57.000> B<00:03:57.209> prisoner<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.070> dark

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
where B prisoner so this is the dark

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.199 
where B prisoner so this is the dark
gray<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.090> that's<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.020> make<00:04:01.140> that

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
gray and that's going to make that

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.630 
gray and that's going to make that
bracket<00:04:03.209> dark<00:04:03.959> gray<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.220> hits<00:04:05.490> this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
bracket dark gray and then it hits this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.810 
bracket dark gray and then it hits this
color<00:04:06.270> change<00:04:06.690> which<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.290> green<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.190> then

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
color change which is a green and then

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.990 
color change which is a green and then
so<00:04:09.660> then<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.989> letter<00:04:10.200> B<00:04:10.560> as<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.310> can<00:04:11.610> see<00:04:11.760> here

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
so then the letter B as you can see here

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.180 
so then the letter B as you can see here
is<00:04:12.239> green<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.020> it's<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.709> hit<00:04:13.860> this

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
is green and it's going to hit this

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.530 
is green and it's going to hit this
which<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.550> going<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.700> change<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.180> dark

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
which is going to change it back to dark

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.760 
which is going to change it back to dark
gray<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:16.020> then<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:16.320> going<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.500> hit<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
gray and then it's going to hit that

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.430 
gray and then it's going to hit that
which<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.130> going<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.390> white<00:04:18.750> F<00:04:19.020> is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
which is going to be that is white F is

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.400 
which is going to be that is white F is
white<00:04:19.739> I'll<00:04:20.040> put<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> link<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.870> color<00:04:22.109> codes

try<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.669> let's<00:04:54.030> try<00:04:54.090> changing<00:04:54.210> my<00:04:54.600> username

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
try this let's try changing my username

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.439 
try this let's try changing my username
to<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.199> purple<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.520> because<00:04:56.789> that<00:04:56.970> makes<00:04:57.240> it

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
to a purple just because that makes it

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.480 
to a purple just because that makes it
easier<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.840> see<00:04:58.139> and<00:04:58.530> then<00:04:58.740> all<00:04:58.949> we<00:04:59.070> need<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.340> do

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
easier to see and then all we need to do

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.129 
easier to see and then all we need to do
is<00:04:59.639> reload<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> pack<00:05:00.419> so<00:05:00.570> that's<00:05:00.780> all<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.050> we

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
is reload the pack so that's all that we

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.980 
is reload the pack so that's all that we
change<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.889> now<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.520> username<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.509> purple

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
change and now a username is that purple

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.290 
change and now a username is that purple
which<00:05:04.139> is<00:05:04.169> five<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.310> guess<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> one<00:05:06.240> thing

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
which is five so I guess the one thing

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.320 
which is five so I guess the one thing
to<00:05:06.539> note<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.960> if<00:05:07.259> you<00:05:07.440> have<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:08.190> username<00:05:08.880> color

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
to note is if you have a username color

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900 
to note is if you have a username color
change<00:05:09.720> right<00:05:09.810> here<00:05:10.349> in<00:05:10.560> your<00:05:11.190> prefix<00:05:11.759> if

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
change right here in your prefix if

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.450 
change right here in your prefix if
you're<00:05:12.120> running<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.539> suffix<00:05:13.020> like<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:13.470> do<00:05:13.560> with

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
you're running a suffix like I do with

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.379 
you're running a suffix like I do with
the<00:05:14.669> VIPs<00:05:15.210> here<00:05:15.570> um<00:05:16.160> it's<00:05:17.160> going<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.729> change

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
the VIPs here um it's going to change

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.779 
the VIPs here um it's going to change
that<00:05:18.930> color<00:05:19.229> unless<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.860> denote<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.580> color

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
that color unless you denote the color

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.659 
that color unless you denote the color
change<00:05:21.120> right<00:05:21.240> here<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:22.949> kind<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.460> think

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
change right here so just kind of think

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.700 
change right here so just kind of think
of<00:05:23.759> it<00:05:23.880> all<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.300> line<00:05:24.509> so<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.780> goes<00:05:24.900> prefix<00:05:25.440> user

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
of it all in line so it goes prefix user

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.360 
of it all in line so it goes prefix user
name<00:05:26.009> suffix<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.820> then<00:05:27.300> message<00:05:27.840> and

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
name suffix and then message and
