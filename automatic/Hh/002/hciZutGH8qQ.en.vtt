00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 yes, and now we are another morning a new day 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.739
 Jacobi have set out to be around us 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.899
 here burn and say Claas 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.009
 and it comes to me because so far continue 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.960
 I think there is at the moment is hold we go outside look what's up 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.289
 because of plus 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 with the monsters seat at the moment all the way 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.069
 I also like to be a bit free 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.749
 He has to pay Toray 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.920
 thanks to the garden 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.360
 and of course need space impulse for the garden 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.310
 the witness 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.660
 I want to buy myself here quite thick in the Berghain 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 and if we really do that, the length in the evening will be as planned 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.200
 Of course, I also want to build connections between the plants here 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.200
 So I think comes 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 with material 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 to give us the time to trust 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.580
 To make Humperdinck Plus 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.589
 The animal is about last 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:00.970
 Be punishable 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.920
 what do you say it is ready 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.510
 the woman five terrain goes out unfortunately did not quite work out 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.380
 not changed 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.040
 they have to offer cut in the test 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.200
 Now it's only 8 years old 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.090
 and that's why I say you support he sees country is called classified 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 conversely, show it here or show it on YouTube 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.649
 that you are 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.010
 Download the triple murder 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.300
 respectively 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.250
 of course you can create 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.380
 Jr actually sees it quite well there are many occupations substances in the world 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 "I like him so far 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.940
 and you can do Gerd Schuberth Barons Wollitz Place 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.560
 and I think you know what I'm doing here 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 thus long viewing platform 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 Witthaus function 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.560
 and juror 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.119
 I thank you in advance for the whole thing, so I think it's me 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.460
 but that's the way it is 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 actively Cook appreciated Zuma 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.429
 he asks for forgiveness 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.899
 Stein pickaxe we do more quickly once 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.909
 Packs of wood should also be enough time 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.659
 and and 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 so Probst 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 Let's take two pieces 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.589
 but now makes the biggest jackpot 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.829
 that when I come to the boxes in the end so much sport 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.219
 I think if we have a bit of time know more advanced 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.219
 Mackes the kicker even three strongholds just her husband has more space 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.789
 I think it's nice Oct 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.829
 maybe like Copenhagen 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.219
 or so bad 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.499
 after it was growing 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.079
 the game probably 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.159
 I'll do it first with Kaulsdorf and dismissed and percent there we have now 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.159
 not yet the raw materials for 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.949
 So so 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.120
 let's do it 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.610
 Jaundern windows are supposed to be at 4 5 6 7 8 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.469
 Showpiece theater comedy course also a bit as wool 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.199
 that would actually take twice that 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 and I just want to say that's what we do 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.569
 then he should be a bit too operated all the chaos here 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.529
 and we need a bit of space 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.529
 for a laugh room if it already Eddy de 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.009
 However, condensed are not betrayed 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.009
 because you can already photo river bottom 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.989
 it is said for once 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 8 that would be here then 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 from 17 clock is clear there is itself 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:05.440
 I hope to make glass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:07.840
 only one 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.840
 and here I trained in an emergency 4 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.949
 6 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.499
 eSports 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.229
 7 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.229
 8th 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.189
 yes, surely we play with Texture PACS I have a few Mosul now 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.189
 they were euro 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.110
 because I think that is quite playful Pietermaritzburg with Tectura 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.120
 Although I said that, we still left the original one to be the impression 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.919
 some 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.919
 do not have it so I can also understand it magnificently 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.190
 You just need a bit of variety sometimes so you want Sun 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.990
 seek with Tectura way 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.490
 I would suggest that composing says how to master 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.710
 contributed 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.710
 with SAS Tectia Piech I think that's great 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.659
 instead of a formalism Comments Basel led and Wichert would have German 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.559
 I can also leave the photos Thorsten Fink 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.939
 but also let that - we like that 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.939
 I do not think that's on the tools 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.729
 Now we have to button our heads suddenly 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.770
 Of course I could do that too 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.210
 use for my purposes Â»mourned right 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.479
 I do that once I'm main and then I can barely Reuters 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.990
 Magath is said to be Poland 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
 Therefore, we have a lot to do around the corner Zloty 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.699
 In the next time we will dig Cinema until 10 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.819
 and that was a bit unfortunate because he broke 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.729
 these classes is coming 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.479
 Of course that has to be Bekir 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.369
 that looks a bit stupid 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.449
 I'm not in such a hurry with the hot iron you get then 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.249
 if you do not look for enough 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.699
 first of all, that's usually the case 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.080
 or one is looking directly and 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.039
 targeted 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.249
 Asus is clear she is
