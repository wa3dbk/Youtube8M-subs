 or the few things so Christmas there are like 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.440
 Christmas balls or Christmas balloons 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.890
 like this for example this for example 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.210
 that we have here in the hand and what does 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.770
 the delights of children that sometimes 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.620
 they create the head up head down 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.900
 Well, this is what we are going to do 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.510
 this obviously we can buy it in 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.190
 the shops, of course, but as 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.190
 you know that the motto of at home with you is 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.210
 it is easy to be useful it 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.920
 economical and fun and fun 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.409
 bauza put what exists the icing on the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.059
 Funny turkey besides in case of Christmas 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.129
 It has to be fun and more is 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.440
 for the kids then let's do 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.390
 those balloons we go from four 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.580
 very simple and very cheap elements 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.830
 that everything has to be said - and let's go 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.170
 to guide through that world of balloons 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.790
 Christmases, of course, yes 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.320
 Hello everyone, look for today 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.590
 materials that we are going to use for 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.580
 make this balloon is distilled water or 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.940
 boiled and then cool it to leave one 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.400
 clean jar 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.840
 with its lid that closes very well 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.610
 hermetically this is very important 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.180
 guys then on the other hand the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.070
 if the liquid glycerin this is achieved 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.680
 in pharmacies or in stores 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.220
 crafts and for this size of the pot 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 let's use about 25 drops if the size 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.280
 of the boat was smaller about 15 but 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.770
 for this 25 is worth then we continue with a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.410
 contact glue that is very very 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.720
 very powerful and very adhesive and then the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.979
 figurine of course we 're going to put 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.530
 inside and player glitter 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.930
 Look, even if it takes you from 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.759
 little stars but look, imagine what 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.680
 you want snow or you want such who does not 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.259
 has a piece of tinsel at home 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.210
 Of course, you cut it in little pieces or 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.750
 little ones or little ones or little ones 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.610
 and you already have here look what we're going to see 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.739
 what will fall inside also and follow 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.440
 is to make snow as we do it 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.630
 same but with a white one or it can be 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.780
 white and silver to make it look more 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.330
 clamorous that clear angelina snow 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.300
 so if you think well silvia let's go 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.580
 to move to the assembly because it really is 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.460
 very simple look at the first 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.020
 the lid and let's take our 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.000
 figurines to stick to the top voucher 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.610
 then with a good glue 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.600
 contact as you well know these children 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.000
 very careful this always you already know with 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.980
 a greater front because nothing mouth or 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.140
 eyes or hands avoid contact 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.120
 totally like sticking your fingers with 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.440
 many like that a lot and then it's a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.210
 horror remove it then there we paste 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 Look at this, we're going to put it almost in the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.400
 center and the doll we will leave 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.830
 to decorate me I think here in 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.140
 our little town that with one and it's already 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.630
 enough then this if I 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.880
 we would have let it dry for about two hours 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.620
 more or less so that it is well alright well 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.500
 dry and sure that nothing has gone in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.000
 air or anything we would use it but as 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.850
 we just did it now for our 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.570
 friends that are at home I'm going to change it 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.120
 for this other cover that already has my 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.460
 doll well well well stuck and he over 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.060
 everything with the benefits there we are 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.660
 the next step we take the jar and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.730
 we throw the distilled water almost 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.340
 almost so that you key to the law of 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.590
 video also boiled chilled sisi 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.020
 because hot then the glues with 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.810
 the basses and that does not work is already 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.690
 cold and would always be left as a little finger 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.120
 or something like it then that's something that 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.910
 we have to calculate now our 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 liquid glycerin that as I have already 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.400
 said for this size more or less go 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.120
 about 25 drops and here measures you see there 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.240
 what remains as one is like something oily 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.980
 a good solution is the one that is going to 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.830
 give then when you can give yourself the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.480
 return what gives the consistency of the 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.040
 water so that it does not fall all at once 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.570
 already with half floating not exactly 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.450
 We put in this case, look, I've 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.270
 chosen a few stars besides me 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.080
 They look like little stars and look what 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.939
 the stars are easy 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.770
 and look and why are not we going to take a 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:38.259
 little bit of tinsel since we have 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.620
 cut into pieces we are going to take 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.569
 also its golden sky landmarks 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.069
 We are totally going to remove a little 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.750
 well with the spoon so that it is well 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:52.479
 distributed to and how nice it is to mix and 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.039
 that he has sent simply remains 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:00.270
 precious the mix and now the end and it's 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.710
 we carefully put our figure 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.090
 we look well for the slits for 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.650
 close it well well well well strong and 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.660
 here we already have it there we already have 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.100
 our father santa and mine 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.750
 and this for a gift to decorate 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.730
 paperweights you are in the garden that does not 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.760
 you can smell the napkins for everything 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:26.020
 what you want or if you have already learned 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.020
 the next you do it
