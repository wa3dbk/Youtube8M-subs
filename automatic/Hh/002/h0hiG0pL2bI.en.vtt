then I'll show you how I'm using it it's
very<00:00:26.580> effective<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.599> experience<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
very effective and in my experience I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.609 
very effective and in my experience I
found<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.250> enables<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.619> on-the-fly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
found that it enables you to on-the-fly

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
found that it enables you to on-the-fly
decide<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.369> you're<00:00:32.460> gonna<00:00:32.520> work<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.300> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
decide what you're gonna work on and and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.180 
decide what you're gonna work on and and
get<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.050> momentum<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.070> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
get some momentum going so as you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.680 
get some momentum going so as you
complete<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.700> task<00:00:36.000> you're<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.440> better

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
complete one task you're in a better

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
complete one task you're in a better
frame<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> mind<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.290> continue<00:00:40.590> working<00:00:40.920> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
frame of mind to continue working on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.869 
frame of mind to continue working on
other<00:00:41.399> tasks<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> helps<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> move<00:00:42.840> along

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
other tasks and it helps you move along

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
other tasks and it helps you move along
anyway<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.210> here's<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> recap<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.379> was

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
anyway so here's the recap that I was

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
anyway so here's the recap that I was
referring<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.789> divide<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> list<00:00:48.450> into

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
referring to you divide the list into

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.810 
referring to you divide the list into
two<00:00:48.690> parts<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> backlog<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.430> active

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
two parts the backlog and the active

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
two parts the backlog and the active
list<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.750> circulate<00:00:52.350> around<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.770> backlog

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
list you circulate around the backlog

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
list you circulate around the backlog
until<00:00:53.610> no<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:53.789> tasks<00:00:54.420> seemed<00:00:54.690> ready<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
until no more tasks seemed ready to be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.250 
until no more tasks seemed ready to be
done<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> notice<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.629> deciding<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
done and notice that's you deciding in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.750 
done and notice that's you deciding in
the<00:00:58.350> moment<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.829> doesn't<00:00:59.160> matter<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the moment it doesn't matter if you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
the moment it doesn't matter if you
previously<00:01:00.420> thought<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> high

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
previously thought there was a high

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
previously thought there was a high
priority<00:01:01.469> tasks<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> feel<00:01:03.120> like

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
priority tasks just what you feel like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.700 
priority tasks just what you feel like
at<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> moment<00:01:04.080> you're<00:01:04.199> looking<00:01:04.500> through

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
at the moment you're looking through

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
at the moment you're looking through
your<00:01:04.880> list<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> things<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.619> once

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
your list of things to do and then once

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
your list of things to do and then once
you<00:01:07.950> complete<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.630> find<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you complete that and you find that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
you complete that and you find that
there's<00:01:10.260> no<00:01:10.470> tasks<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> backlog<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> work

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there's no tasks in the backlog to work

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
there's no tasks in the backlog to work
on<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.080> pass<00:01:13.320> through<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> active

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on you do one pass through the active

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
on you do one pass through the active
list<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.790> allows<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.420> urgent<00:01:15.840> tasks

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
list that allows you to get urgent tasks

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
list that allows you to get urgent tasks
completed<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.950> may<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.189> added<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
completed that you may have added and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
completed that you may have added and
then<00:01:18.299> after<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
then after that you go back to the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.190 
then after that you go back to the
backlog<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> continue<00:01:20.689> cycling<00:01:21.689> around<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
backlog and continue cycling around the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
backlog and continue cycling around the
backlog<00:01:22.590> once<00:01:23.369> you've<00:01:23.520> completed<00:01:23.909> every<00:01:24.210> task

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
backlog once you've completed every task

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080 
backlog once you've completed every task
in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> backlog<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.400> move<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> line

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in the backlog then you move the line

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
in the backlog then you move the line
down<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> line<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> delimiter<00:01:28.619> between

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
down the line is the delimiter between

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
down the line is the delimiter between
the<00:01:29.130> active<00:01:29.460> list<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> backlog<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> then

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the active list and the backlog and then

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
the active list and the backlog and then
you<00:01:31.170> start<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> new<00:01:31.590> list<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.759> gonna

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you start a new list so I'm just gonna

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
you start a new list so I'm just gonna
run<00:01:33.180> through<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> few<00:01:33.720> examples<00:01:34.290> I've<00:01:34.950> created

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
run through a few examples I've created

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.980 
run through a few examples I've created
here<00:01:35.960> check<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.909> online<00:01:39.720> tool<00:01:39.960> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
here check this is the online tool that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.240 
here check this is the online tool that
I've<00:01:40.229> been<00:01:40.259> using<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.860> found<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I've been using and I found it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.910 
I've been using and I found it's
extremely<00:01:41.759> effective<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.210> auto<00:01:42.450> focus<00:01:42.920> any

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
extremely effective for auto focus any

extremely effective for auto focus any
number<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:45.030> through<00:01:45.270> four<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
number of them one through four but I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.760 
number of them one through four but I
prefer<00:01:46.590> four<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> list<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.590> things

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
prefer four so this is a list of things

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.319 
prefer four so this is a list of things
to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.250> simply<00:01:50.579> write<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> list<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to do you simply write out a list of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.760 
to do you simply write out a list of
things<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.170> put<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> line<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
things to do you put a line at the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.130 
things to do you put a line at the
bottom<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.790> start<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:54.270> now

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bottom so that's how you start out now

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.670 
bottom so that's how you start out now
as<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.680> reviewing<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.670> I'll<00:01:57.350> go<00:01:58.350> through

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
as I'm reviewing this I'll go through

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
as I'm reviewing this I'll go through
and<00:01:58.860> let's<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.579> want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> clear<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.600> my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and let's say I want to clear off my

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
and let's say I want to clear off my
desk<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.290> that's<00:02:01.469> something<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.310> is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
desk so that's something that I think is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.749 
desk so that's something that I think is
a<00:02:03.049> useful<00:02:04.049> thing<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> make

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
a useful thing to do I'm going to make

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.790 
a useful thing to do I'm going to make
sure<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.710> see<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.920> hidden

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
sure that I can see that hidden

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.070 
sure that I can see that hidden
the<00:02:10.130> list<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:10.520> they<00:02:10.670> don't<00:02:10.850> go<00:02:11.000> away<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.870> let's

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
the list so they don't go away so let's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.990 
the list so they don't go away so let's
say<00:02:12.260> clear<00:02:12.680> off<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.010> desk<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.610> complete

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
say clear off my desk and I complete

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.870 
say clear off my desk and I complete
that<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.080> go<00:02:15.260> through<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:16.070> keep<00:02:16.580> going

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
that so then I go through I keep going

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.250 
that so then I go through I keep going
through<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.790> let's<00:02:19.790> say<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.480> check<00:02:20.810> my<00:02:20.960> email

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
through and let's say I check my email

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.200 
through and let's say I check my email
that's<00:02:21.500> an<00:02:21.590> easy<00:02:21.740> one<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.820> check<00:02:23.060> my

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
that's an easy one to do so I check my

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.180 
that's an easy one to do so I check my
email<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.260> check<00:02:24.530> my<00:02:24.680> email<00:02:24.980> it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
email and when I check my email it's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.580 
email and when I check my email it's
often<00:02:25.520> common<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.270> find<00:02:26.420> other<00:02:26.690> tasks<00:02:27.260> so

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
often common to find other tasks so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.870 
often common to find other tasks so
let's<00:02:27.770> say<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.310> need<00:02:28.940> an<00:02:29.030> email<00:02:29.560> Jo<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:31.790> I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
let's say I need an email Jo and then I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.810 
let's say I need an email Jo and then I
need<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.260> let's<00:02:33.260> say<00:02:33.440> reply<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:35.500> Frank<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.460> note

need a let's say reply to Frank so note

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.790 
need a let's say reply to Frank so note
that<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.030> put<00:02:38.270> those<00:02:38.390> tasks<00:02:38.900> below<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.500> line

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
that I put those tasks below this line

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.000 
that I put those tasks below this line
so<00:02:40.490> all<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.390> items<00:02:41.630> up<00:02:41.810> here<00:02:41.840> I'll<00:02:42.620> still

so all of the items up here I'll still

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.920 
so all of the items up here I'll still
continue<00:02:43.130> working<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.820> these<00:02:44.450> items<00:02:44.810> down

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
continue working on these items down

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.590 
continue working on these items down
below<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.920> don't<00:02:46.100> touch<00:02:46.370> until<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.570> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
below you don't touch until we do a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.020 
below you don't touch until we do a
single<00:02:47.900> pass<00:02:48.230> through<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.100> upper<00:02:49.790> list

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
single pass through this upper list

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.510 
single pass through this upper list
where<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.390> don't<00:02:50.570> complete<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> task<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:52.250> let's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
where you don't complete a task so let's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.480 
where you don't complete a task so let's
say<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:53.120> take<00:02:53.270> out<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.510> trash<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.460> then<00:02:55.460> I

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
say I can take out the trash and then I

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.420 
say I can take out the trash and then I
go<00:02:55.790> through<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:57.050> now<00:02:57.620> let's<00:02:57.830> say<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.070> don't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
go through and now let's say I don't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.390 
go through and now let's say I don't
have<00:02:58.610> any<00:02:58.880> other<00:02:59.770> tasks<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.010> feel<00:03:01.370> like

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
have any other tasks that I feel like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.790 
have any other tasks that I feel like
they're<00:03:01.820> ready<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.270> do<00:03:02.510> here<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.020> now<00:03:03.440> jump

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
they're ready to do here I now jump

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.240 
they're ready to do here I now jump
below<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.370> line<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.500> look<00:03:06.500> at<00:03:06.620> these<00:03:06.740> tasks

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
below this line and look at these tasks

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.830 
below this line and look at these tasks
now<00:03:07.340> let's<00:03:07.550> say<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.940> reply<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.270> Frank<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.810> a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
now let's say the reply to Frank is a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.560 
now let's say the reply to Frank is a
short<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.290> so<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> quickly<00:03:10.700> reply<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> Frank

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
short one so I quickly reply to Frank

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.560 
short one so I quickly reply to Frank
and<00:03:11.870> then<00:03:12.500> mark<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.070> completed<00:03:13.610> since

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
and then mark that as completed since

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.040 
and then mark that as completed since
I've<00:03:14.780> done<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:15.470> I'll<00:03:15.890> go<00:03:16.130> up<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.520> again

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
I've done that one I'll go up here again

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.050 
I've done that one I'll go up here again
let's<00:03:18.050> say<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.320> finally<00:03:18.950> post<00:03:19.190> my<00:03:19.400> blog<00:03:19.550> entry

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
let's say I finally post my blog entry

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.100 
let's say I finally post my blog entry
and<00:03:20.209> I've<00:03:21.050> been<00:03:21.170> putting<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:21.770> off<00:03:21.920> and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
and I've been putting this one off and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.360 
and I've been putting this one off and
you'll<00:03:24.110> note<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:24.380> as<00:03:24.770> you're<00:03:24.980> clearing<00:03:25.190> off

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
you'll note that as you're clearing off

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.640 
you'll note that as you're clearing off
other<00:03:25.580> items<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.300> just<00:03:26.720> reducing<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.230> size<00:03:27.530> of

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
other items is just reducing the size of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.320 
other items is just reducing the size of
the<00:03:27.709> list<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.520> get<00:03:28.640> closer<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.060> closer

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
the list so as you get closer and closer

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.420 
the list so as you get closer and closer
to<00:03:29.570> being<00:03:29.600> done<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.230> realize<00:03:30.440> those<00:03:30.980> tasks

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
to being done you realize those tasks

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.040 
to being done you realize those tasks
that<00:03:31.489> you've<00:03:31.670> been<00:03:31.760> kind<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.030> putting<00:03:32.239> off<00:03:32.450> so

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
that you've been kind of putting off so

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.380 
that you've been kind of putting off so
that's<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.380> finally<00:03:33.830> go<00:03:33.980> grab<00:03:34.190> my<00:03:34.340> keys<00:03:34.610> jump

and now all of a sudden I have this list

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.160 
and now all of a sudden I have this list
now<00:03:55.070> check<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.480> was<00:03:56.660> just<00:03:56.840> for<00:03:56.959> demo

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
now check this this was just for demo

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.990 
now check this this was just for demo
purposes<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:57.890> you<00:03:57.950> can<00:03:58.160> hide<00:03:58.370> completed

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
purposes but you can hide completed

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.630 
purposes but you can hide completed
tasks<00:03:59.450> which<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.560> do<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:00.980> as<00:04:01.160> you're

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
tasks which I can do so as you're

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.199 
tasks which I can do so as you're
completing<00:04:02.060> them<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.780> reduces<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.500> down<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
completing them it reduces it down and

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.820 
completing them it reduces it down and
then<00:04:05.209> as<00:04:05.420> I<00:04:05.450> continue<00:04:06.230> working<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:06.709> these

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
then as I continue working on these

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.150 
then as I continue working on these
tasks<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.610> can

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:19.870 

I<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:13.310> continue<00:04:13.970> adding<00:04:14.270> new<00:04:14.570> tasks<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:18.880> note

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
I can continue adding new tasks and note

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.930 
I can continue adding new tasks and note
that<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.090> continued<00:04:20.600> working<00:04:20.750> on<00:04:21.049> ones<00:04:21.320> up<00:04:21.560> here

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
that I continued working on ones up here

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.330 
that I continued working on ones up here
so<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.480> processes<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.320> fairly<00:04:24.770> simple<00:04:25.220> you

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
so the processes is fairly simple you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.880 
so the processes is fairly simple you
simply<00:04:25.960> cycle<00:04:26.960> through<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.290> upper<00:04:27.650> part

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
through them all without choosing you

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.870 
through them all without choosing you
need<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.930> do<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> single<00:04:34.310> pass<00:04:34.490> through

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
need to do you do a single pass through
