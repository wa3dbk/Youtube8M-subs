Ricardo<00:05:14.010> attacking<00:05:14.520> Rob<00:05:14.730> Van<00:05:14.880> Dam<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.420> this

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
Ricardo attacking Rob Van Dam in this

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.080 
Ricardo attacking Rob Van Dam in this
match<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.650> that<00:05:16.800> Alberto<00:05:17.130> Del<00:05:17.550> Rio<00:05:17.790> will

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
match so that Alberto Del Rio will

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.490 
match so that Alberto Del Rio will
retain<00:05:18.420> his<00:05:18.600> title<00:05:18.630> at<00:05:19.050> Night<00:05:19.110> of<00:05:19.290> Champions

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
much momentum when he does actually lose

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.160
