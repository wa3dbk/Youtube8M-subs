00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.500
 I would like to have perfect health today 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 give them a new model in our vita 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.630
 mix assortment introduce the vita mix 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.830
 per 750 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.130
 First, I want you the engine block 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 and introduce the control panel 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.760
 we have here on the side of the of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 switch also lighting on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.189
 Front display enabled on the right we have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.750
 the start stop switch with the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 Rotary switch in the middle will be the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.399
 stepless speed regulated and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.399
 There are five predefined programs 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.530
 available for smoothies and green 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 Smoothies probably the most common use of the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 Vita mix for ice cream and desserts for hot 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 soups the vita mix does not have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 a heating ctio naber by the high 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.989
 speed of the knife and the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 Frictional heat they get after 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 Completion of the program 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 boiling soup for puree around 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 for example baby food and seniors 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 to make food and that yourself 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.360
 cleaning program for the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 uncomplicated cleaning on the left we have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 you can still do the pulse function with it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.900
 Just run the vita mix for a short time 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.400
 for example, to hook almonds without them 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 to pulverize immediately 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 the pulse function is useful if 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.240
 you still have a bit of the mix good 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 and you want control over the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.100
 texture of the food 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.850
 What makes the Vita Mix different? 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.490
 per 750 from the classic vita mix tnc 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.130
 5200 the differences are on the one hand 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.409
 in the scope of function so the five 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 predefined programs 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 so-called smart blending and the pulse 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 function of the vita mix pro 750 holds through 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.680
 a microprocessor feedback on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 the resistance of the knife blogs and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.939
 varies during the well-defined 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 Mix the speed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.070
 automatically and makes the mixing process 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.439
 thus even more effective through this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.200
 function you rarely need to stop 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.289
 lay hands 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 In addition, the vita mix pro 750 has 22 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.469
 ps 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.310
 a ten percent stronger engine 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:19.879
 than the tnc 5200, thus achieving a 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.920
 about 50 km / h higher 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:27.420
 maximum speed of 434 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.639
 kilometers as the tnc 5200 was 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 for even finer and creamier results 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:37.530
 the mix container of the pro 750 ensures 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.310
 wider and lower and has 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.450
 as well as 20 liter capacity 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.939
 of course, there is also the new mix 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.609
 containers from ppa free tretern 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:51.000
 he is light and yet very robust 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.549
 facilitates the compact design 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.109
 not only the removal of the mix good and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.269
 the cleaning of the mix container in the 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.949
 sink but allows the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.919
 set up even at lower hanging 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:04.319
 kitchen cupboards suitable for the wider 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:08.269
 Mix container is the knife block too 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:12.090
 correspondingly longer than the tnc 5200 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:16.139
 the vita mix pro 750 is about 40 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.909
 percent lower than the tnc 5200's 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.370
 was achieved by an optimization 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.060
 the air flow provides better insulation 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.620
 and the highly efficient engine of the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.049
 benefit from noise reduction 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.019
 noise sensitive neighbors small children 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.699
 and pets 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.979
 the pro 750 is produced like the 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.049
 other models also handmade in 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:40.590
 the usa and comes with one 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.470
 seven year manufacturer 's warranty 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.739
 vita mix pro 750 belongs to the next 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.889
 generation of the g series with the vita mix 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.019
 For every 750 you buy a device that 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.030
 many kitchen appliances replaced and so on 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.689
 valuable space on your work space 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.449
 saves 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.489
 the goal of vita mix was one 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.799
 machine to develop the one due 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.620
 the sophisticated mix system daily 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.560
 want to use the smart landing 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.669
 function of stepless 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.219
 speed control and the 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.400
 Silent engine mix better than ever 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.400
 before 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 over 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.830
 if you liked the video and 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.530
 was helpful 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.229
 We look forward to a comment and 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.290
