00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
a moment but just fiercely reflections

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.610 
a moment but just fiercely reflections
on<00:00:08.429> last<00:00:08.610> weekend<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.300> close<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.200> not<00:00:10.469> quite

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
on last weekend and close but not quite

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.299 
on last weekend and close but not quite
there<00:00:10.920> yeah<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:12.590> Everton<00:00:13.590> said<00:00:14.009> well<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
there yeah I think Everton said well to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.430 
there yeah I think Everton said well to
be<00:00:14.610> fair<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:15.450> stopped<00:00:15.719> us<00:00:15.839> play<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.260> usual

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
be fair they stopped us play in a usual

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.099 
be fair they stopped us play in a usual
game<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.390> when<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.539> add<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> ball<00:00:18.960> they

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
game and when they add the ball they

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.320 
game and when they add the ball they
made<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.590> difficult<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.160> us<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> close

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
made it very difficult for us to close

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120 
made it very difficult for us to close
the<00:00:21.480> gaps<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:21.930> we've<00:00:22.140> probably<00:00:22.380> been<00:00:22.890> good

the gaps which we've probably been good
at<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> previous<00:00:23.699> games<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.769> we

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
could modify that and implement our own

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
could modify that and implement our own
style<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> game<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.420> spent<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> long<00:01:00.899> time

their special memories of that time yeah
it's<00:01:04.019> been<00:01:04.140> obviously<00:01:04.890> most<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.850> career<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's been obviously most of my career to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
it's been obviously most of my career to
be<00:01:06.420> fair<00:01:06.659> apart<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> few<00:01:08.130> months<00:01:08.400> here

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
be fair apart from the few months here

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.020 
be fair apart from the few months here
and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.270> years<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.630> had<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.900> Darby<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> yeah

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I think I went there as a 18 year old

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
I think I went there as a 18 year old
boy<00:01:14.670> sort<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.390> left<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> 26<00:01:16.530> year

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
boy sort of thing and left as a 26 year

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520 
boy sort of thing and left as a 26 year
old<00:01:17.009> man<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.490> I'll<00:01:18.450> always<00:01:18.659> old<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.080> time<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
old man so I'll always old my time in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
old man so I'll always old my time in
high<00:01:19.710> regard<00:01:20.180> was<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> key<00:01:21.509> time<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.960> your

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
high regard was it a key time in your

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
high regard was it a key time in your

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
development as a player yeah I think so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.960 
development as a player yeah I think so
most<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.509> development<00:01:24.780> took<00:01:25.200> place<00:01:25.259> there

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
most of my development took place there

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
most of my development took place there
as<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.180> say<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> left<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.170> sort<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> boy

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
as I say when I left I was sort of a boy

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.969 
as I say when I left I was sort of a boy

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.929 
game and I think why art loans going to
be<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> toughest<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> season<00:01:47.340> we

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
be one of the toughest of the season we

day find out the team and then hopefully
as<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.930> say<00:02:37.080> implement<00:02:37.560> our<00:02:37.620> own<00:02:37.769> style<00:02:38.129> on<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
as I say implement our own style on the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.509 
as I say implement our own style on the
game<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.440> first<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> foremost<00:02:40.709> make<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.400> odd

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
game and first and foremost make it odd

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.850 
game and first and foremost make it odd
for<00:02:41.700> us<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:43.200> course<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> best

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
for us to be of course it's the best

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.320 
for us to be of course it's the best
back<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.220> back<00:02:44.340> games<00:02:44.370> at<00:02:44.760> Tottenham<00:02:45.090> as<00:02:45.180> well

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
back to back games at Tottenham as well

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.820 
back to back games at Tottenham as well
it's<00:02:45.480> they're<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.620> an<00:02:46.709> interesting

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it's they're going to be an interesting

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.820 
it's they're going to be an interesting
week<00:02:47.190> yeah<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.030> think<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:49.019> both<00:02:49.230> teams<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.709> be

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
week yeah I think well both teams to be

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.070 
week yeah I think well both teams to be
favored<00:02:50.220> maybe<00:02:50.790> change<00:02:51.120> 10<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.510> 11<00:02:51.870> players

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
favored maybe change 10 or 11 players

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.949 
favored maybe change 10 or 11 players
for<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> cup<00:02:52.800> game<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.810> think<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
for all the cup game so I think the

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.809 
for all the cup game so I think the
manager<00:02:55.349> sees<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.769> league<00:02:55.950> has<00:02:56.160> maybe<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
manager sees the league has maybe the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.970 
manager sees the league has maybe the
most<00:02:56.970> important<00:02:57.569> which<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.440> fair<00:02:58.650> enough<00:02:58.680> but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
most important which is fair enough but

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.070 
most important which is fair enough but
equally<00:02:59.610> Wednesday's<00:03:00.330> game<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> win<00:03:01.050> that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
equally Wednesday's game if you win that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.229 
equally Wednesday's game if you win that
you're<00:03:01.470> not<00:03:01.590> far<00:03:01.830> away<00:03:01.920> from<00:03:02.040> getting<00:03:02.970> quite

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
you're not far away from getting quite

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.840 
you're not far away from getting quite
far<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> competition
