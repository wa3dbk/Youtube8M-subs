00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.520 
now one of the things that you probably
have<00:02:07.090> noticed<00:02:07.479> right<00:02:07.630> off<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.020> bat<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.470> that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
have noticed right off the bat is that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.160 
have noticed right off the bat is that
the<00:02:09.039> video<00:02:09.700> thumbnail<00:02:10.360> up<00:02:10.630> here<00:02:10.959> is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the video thumbnail up here is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.680 
the video thumbnail up here is
relatively<00:02:11.770> small<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:13.000> hard<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.360> see

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
relatively small and it's hard to see

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.850 
relatively small and it's hard to see
especially<00:02:13.959> if<00:02:14.319> you're<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> use<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
especially if you're going to use that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.610 
especially if you're going to use that
to<00:02:15.310> edit<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> video<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.990> solution<00:02:17.470> has

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
to edit the video with the solution has

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.180 
to edit the video with the solution has
come<00:02:17.890> down<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:19.360> can<00:02:19.540> make<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
come down here and we can make the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.280 
come down here and we can make the
thumbnail<00:02:21.190> larger<00:02:21.760> or<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:23.050> come<00:02:23.260> down

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
thumbnail larger or we can come down

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.559 
thumbnail larger or we can come down
here<00:02:23.680> make<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.160> largest<00:02:24.340> possible<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
here make it the largest possible and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.550 
here make it the largest possible and
that<00:02:25.989> way<00:02:26.140> when<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.530> move<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.569> editing<00:02:28.569> line

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that way when we move the editing line

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.800 
that way when we move the editing line
tool<00:02:29.860> here<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> video<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.209> easier<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
tool here on the video it's easier to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.530 
tool here on the video it's easier to
see<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.319> we<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.280> also<00:02:33.459> right<00:02:33.880> click<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.420> get

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
see and we can also right click and get

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.350 
see and we can also right click and get
a<00:02:34.569> menu<00:02:34.870> while<00:02:35.200> we're<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.890> video<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.640> we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
a menu while we're on the video and we

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.150 
a menu while we're on the video and we
can<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:37.989> stuff<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.860> one<00:02:39.010> of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
can do a lot of stuff here and one of

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.790 
can do a lot of stuff here and one of
them<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.120> splice<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.870> video

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
them is that we can splice the video

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.320 
them is that we can splice the video
into<00:02:42.430> two<00:02:42.700> separate<00:02:43.269> scenes

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
into two separate scenes

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.350 
into two separate scenes
and<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.560> add<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> transition<00:02:47.640> between<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and we can add a transition between the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.620 
and we can add a transition between the
two<00:02:48.540> scenes<00:02:48.870> within<00:02:49.410> our<00:02:49.560> project<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.310> like

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
two scenes within our project if we like

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.730 
two scenes within our project if we like
