00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
are still some things we can do modeling

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.099 
are still some things we can do modeling
and<00:00:14.280> shading<00:00:14.670> wise<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.210> give<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.780> life<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
and shading wise to give some life to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.939 
and shading wise to give some life to
our<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.480> start<00:00:18.779> without<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.800> an

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
our I so we'll start without you with an

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.970 
our I so we'll start without you with an
us<00:00:20.699> fear<00:00:21.060> 32<00:00:21.930> by<00:00:22.050> 32<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> ok<00:00:23.510> we<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.630> enough

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
us fear 32 by 32 is ok we have enough

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.939 
us fear 32 by 32 is ok we have enough
polygons<00:00:25.980> earth<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.369> play<00:00:26.550> with<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.619> we<00:00:28.619> got

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
polygons earth to play with so we got

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
polygons earth to play with so we got
our<00:00:29.029> glow<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.330> our<00:00:30.890> cornea<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.189> well<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.200> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
our glow I our cornea as well and the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
our glow I our cornea as well and the
same<00:00:34.500> shape<00:00:34.890> we're<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
same shape we're going to use for the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700 
same shape we're going to use for the
cornea<00:00:36.600> we're<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> use<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cornea we're going to use it for the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
cornea we're going to use it for the
ideas<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.219> well<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.059> where<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
ideas as well so we see where we want to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.970 
ideas as well so we see where we want to
cut<00:00:44.120> maybe<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.360> ok<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.739> we're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
cut maybe there is ok and now we're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.290 
cut maybe there is ok and now we're
going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.180> rib<00:00:48.719> tool<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> V

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
going to use the rib tool which is V

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
going to use the rib tool which is V
circuit<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.289> hotkey<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
circuit the hotkey so this like a lot of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
circuit the hotkey so this like a lot of
other<00:00:56.550> tools<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.239> blender<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.989> tool<00:00:58.320> depends

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
other tools in blender this tool depends

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.580 
other tools in blender this tool depends
on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> position<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> cursor<00:01:00.539> where<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
on the position of the cursor where the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
on the position of the cursor where the
cursor<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.520> hit<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> shortcut<00:01:03.799> which

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
cursor is when we hit the shortcut which

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.690 
cursor is when we hit the shortcut which
is<00:01:04.920> V<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.250> care<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:10.700> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
is V so you have to take care of that so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.850 
is V so you have to take care of that so
in<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.880> case<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> left<00:01:13.590> side

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in this case I got it on the left side

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.940 
in this case I got it on the left side
so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> should<00:01:15.119> press<00:01:15.509> fee<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> left<00:01:16.470> side

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
so I should press fee on the left side

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.649 
so I should press fee on the left side
and<00:01:17.280> lender<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.970> cut<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.340> direction<00:01:20.659> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and lender will cut to that direction so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
and lender will cut to that direction so
now<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.900> select<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.130> an

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
now i just select this because it's an

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820 
now i just select this because it's an
island<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.759> i<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.030> click<00:01:24.330> l<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.799> i

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
island so i just click l and now i

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.730 
island so i just click l and now i
select<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.750> we<00:01:27.750> said<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
select it we said we're going to use the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.550 
select it we said we're going to use the
same<00:01:28.920> shape<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.549> i<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.939> duplicated<00:01:30.780> shifty

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
same shape so i just duplicated shifty

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.899 
same shape so i just duplicated shifty
and<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:32.820> rotate<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.560> 180<00:01:34.560> degrees<00:01:35.180> or<00:01:36.180> 180<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
and now rotate it 180 degrees or 180 and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.660 
and now rotate it 180 degrees or 180 and
Stan<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> pupil<00:01:40.650> we're<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> use

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
Stan so for the pupil we're going to use

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.410 
Stan so for the pupil we're going to use
exactly<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> same<00:01:43.140> shape<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.610> more

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
exactly the same shape which is more

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.889 
exactly the same shape which is more
flat<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.270> duplicated<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.479> scale

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
flat so which is duplicated then scale

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.210 
flat so which is duplicated then scale
on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> y-axis<00:01:49.970> then<00:01:50.970> press<00:01:51.210> 0<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.009> tip

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
on the y-axis then press 0 and the tip

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
on the y-axis then press 0 and the tip
now<00:01:54.149> we've<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.450> our<00:01:54.479> flat

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
now we've got our flat

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
now we've got our flat
pupil<00:01:57.060> yeah<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.150> these<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.630> shapes<00:02:00.869> we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
pupil yeah so with these three shapes we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
pupil yeah so with these three shapes we
can<00:02:01.350> already<00:02:01.470> start<00:02:01.770> building<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.360> we'll

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
can already start building or I so we'll

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.820 
can already start building or I so we'll
take<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.290> what's<00:02:05.190> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.970> your<00:02:06.000> IDs<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
take the what's going to be your IDs and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.780 
take the what's going to be your IDs and
we'll<00:02:07.830> try<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.130> snap<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.190> first<00:02:11.459> ring

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
we'll try to snap it to the first ring

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.570 
we'll try to snap it to the first ring
of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.720> first<00:02:12.989> loop<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.890> string<00:02:14.190> of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
of the the first loop of string of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.610 
of the the first loop of string of
paris's<00:02:15.120> there<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.370> just

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
paris's there we can do it by just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
paris's there we can do it by just
looking<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.739> but<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.250> will<00:02:20.400> take<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.850> lot<00:02:21.120> of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
looking at it but it will take a lot of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
looking at it but it will take a lot of
time<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.840> there<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.319> nice<00:02:22.680> tool<00:02:22.980> which<00:02:23.190> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
time so there is a nice tool which is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.550 
time so there is a nice tool which is
called<00:02:23.550> snap<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.830> GF<00:02:26.400> tab<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:27.120> well<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.290> what

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
called snap is a GF tab as well so what

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
called snap is a GF tab as well so what
if<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.920> hold<00:02:29.130> control<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.150> option

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
if you hold control with this option

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.820 
if you hold control with this option
turn<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.739> will<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> little<00:02:32.340> circle<00:02:32.940> on

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
turn on you will see a little circle on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.590 
turn on you will see a little circle on
the<00:02:34.830> valises<00:02:35.310> where<00:02:35.610> your<00:02:35.940> cursor<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.819> that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the valises where your cursor is so that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.390 
the valises where your cursor is so that
means<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.080> blender<00:02:40.440> will<00:02:40.709> snap<00:02:41.069> our

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
means the blender will snap our

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960 
means the blender will snap our
selection<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.569> very<00:02:43.080> same<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:44.760> still

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
selection to that very same for still

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.479 
selection to that very same for still
you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.890> still<00:02:47.130> got<00:02:47.340> this

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
you can see that here you still got this

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.220 
you can see that here you still got this
really<00:02:47.989> sharp<00:02:48.989> edge<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.799> these<00:02:50.459> because

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
really sharp edge there these because

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
really sharp edge there these because
they're<00:02:52.340> overlapping<00:02:53.340> vertices<00:02:53.640> there

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
they're overlapping vertices there

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
they're overlapping vertices there
there's<00:02:55.290> an<00:02:55.560> option<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.160> fix<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.640> which<00:02:56.880> is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
there's an option to fix that which is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
there's an option to fix that which is
called<00:02:57.239> Auto<00:02:57.480> Marsh<00:02:57.840> editing<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:59.390> which<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.630> we

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
called Auto Marsh editing in which if we

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.280 
called Auto Marsh editing in which if we
redo<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.280> same<00:03:02.489> operation<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.810> with<00:03:04.049> this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
redo the same operation but with this

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.610 
redo the same operation but with this
option<00:03:04.500> enabled<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.320> see<00:03:09.380> we<00:03:10.380> do<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
option enabled you can see we do the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.759 
option enabled you can see we do the
same<00:03:10.860> hold<00:03:11.250> ctrl<00:03:11.459> click<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:13.260> blender

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
same hold ctrl click and now blender

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.789 
same hold ctrl click and now blender
will<00:03:14.760> automatically<00:03:15.720> remove<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
will automatically remove the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.110 
will automatically remove the
overlapping<00:03:17.160> vertices<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.850> merge<00:03:18.090> or

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
overlapping vertices will merge or

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.960 
overlapping vertices will merge or
overlapping<00:03:21.120> vertices<00:03:22.579> recalculate<00:03:23.579> normal

overlapping vertices recalculate normal
cervical<00:03:24.359> seriously<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.140> had<00:03:25.500> inverter<00:03:26.130> these

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
cervical seriously I had inverter these

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.259 
cervical seriously I had inverter these
faces<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.500> now<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:29.190> looks<00:03:29.370> much<00:03:29.700> more<00:03:29.940> nice<00:03:32.269> so

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
faces so now it looks much more nice so

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.050 
faces so now it looks much more nice so
this<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.780> shape<00:03:34.049> we<00:03:34.079> want<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:35.400> blender<00:03:35.880> to

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
this is the shape we want for blender to

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.930 
this is the shape we want for blender to
calculate<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> little<00:03:36.870> bright<00:03:37.829> side<00:03:38.280> specular

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
calculate a little bright side specular

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.360 
calculate a little bright side specular
bright<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.450> our<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.230> that's<00:03:40.739> why<00:03:40.859> we<00:03:41.040> wanted<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
bright on our I that's why we wanted to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.979 
bright on our I that's why we wanted to
be<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.880> bit<00:03:42.510> curved<00:03:42.930> like<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> inside<00:03:45.359> so<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
be a bit curved like to the inside so I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.080 
be a bit curved like to the inside so I
just<00:03:46.230> move<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> pupil<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.000> inside

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.339 

nice<00:03:53.060> yeah<00:03:54.060> even<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.510> right<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:58.170> we

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
nice yeah even that right there so we

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.070 
nice yeah even that right there so we
just<00:03:58.500> may<00:03:58.650> need<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.129> close<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.510> we

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
just may need to close this I but we

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.100 
just may need to close this I but we
don't<00:04:01.319> want<00:04:01.700> to<00:04:02.700> use<00:04:02.910> auto<00:04:03.239> March<00:04:03.569> editing

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
don't want to use auto March editing

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.930 
don't want to use auto March editing
here<00:04:05.269> going<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.360> disable<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.930> otherwise<00:04:07.940> we'll

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
here going to disable it otherwise we'll

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.180 
here going to disable it otherwise we'll
have<00:04:09.269> an<00:04:09.540> internal<00:04:09.959> faces<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.769> could

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
have an internal faces and that could

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.039 
have an internal faces and that could
lead<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.459> really<00:04:12.180> ugly<00:04:12.360> shading<00:04:13.290> problems<00:04:15.049> but

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
lead to really ugly shading problems but

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.229 
lead to really ugly shading problems but
that's<00:04:16.229> okay<00:04:16.500> for<00:04:16.709> now<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:17.790> let's<00:04:17.970> put<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
that's okay for now so let's put it

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.250 
that's okay for now so let's put it
there<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.720> then<00:04:18.780> as<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> last<00:04:20.040> step<00:04:21.260> we're

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
there and then as a last step we're

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.560 
there and then as a last step we're
going<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.500> give<00:04:22.740> some<00:04:23.130> more<00:04:23.490> volume<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.300> this

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
going to give some more volume to this

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.420 
going to give some more volume to this
cornea<00:04:24.990> song<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> little<00:04:25.620> bit<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.300> bevel<00:04:28.430> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
cornea song a little bit more bevel so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.879 
cornea song a little bit more bevel so
let's<00:04:30.150> move<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.810> little<00:04:31.139> bit<00:04:31.290> then

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
let's move it out a little bit then

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.990 
let's move it out a little bit then
extra<00:04:32.340> ringer

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
extra ringer

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.260 
extra ringer
that's<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.980> now<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.280> can<00:04:37.580> just<00:04:37.610> move<00:04:38.030> to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
that's so now we can just move to

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.080 
that's so now we can just move to
shading
