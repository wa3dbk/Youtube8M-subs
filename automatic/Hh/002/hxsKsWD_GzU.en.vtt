00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:17.579
 I will do the first crochet first 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:20.939
 loop so now i will do the central 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:26.159
 loop and now here in this central 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.079
 loop I need to dial 7 loops second 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.769
 loop I insert the hook from the front to 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.489
 purl third loop with purl 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.280
 on the front that is like this 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 then 4 5 from the front to the back 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 side 5 loops to with purl on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690
 facial 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.399
 that is, here I have five loops 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:01:00.829
 Now I gently remove the hook and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.829
 loop wear a knitting needle 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.390
 and I have to dial two more loops 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:17.530
 since i’m going to get a total of 7 that is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:20.530
 this one on the face so the sixth and 7 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.530
 inside out 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:39.509
 then I will remove the hook on these two loops 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 these two loops will wear a knitting needle and so 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.670
 now I need the loops 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.990
 knit facial that is just 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.460
 neatly here is not very convenient 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:58.369
 will knit so I knit all the loops 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.369
 facial 2 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.619
 vitya and so on and so here I am 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.040
 knitted 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.170
 7 loops with facial loops and now 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.660
 I need to add loops that is to me 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.030
 you need to add 7 loops which means that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.360
 benefits after every facial that is and 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.880
 again I knit the first loop of my face 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.980
 I need to add a loop again 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.170
 front that is, I will add instead 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.079
 broach that is here between 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.850
 adjacent eyelets 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.299
 then again knit facial 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.959
 this is already the second loop as 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:47.010
 added 3 and instead of broach 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.220
 that is, here here and the eyelets are better 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 throw because it is inconvenient all the loops 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 are on the same needle 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 that is, here I add a loop and everything 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.790
 I’ve got 4 loops already 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.660
 if i add 7 fly accordingly 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 I should get a total of 14 and so here 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.079
 I added loops and now I have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.989
 knitting needles 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:17.310
 14 loops now 14 5 need to knit 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.840
 that is, I will have a loop 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.440
 front and then a loop of broach 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.120
 too facial well and so 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.359
 then you need to carefully knit all 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.430
 loops and so here i have fastened 14 loops and 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.590
 now we will need to give the loop again 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.110
 I will add only after 2 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.640
 loops i mean i spent 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.460
 in the first loop of the front of the second 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.270
 loop on the face and then in the broach 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:56.480
 adding a loop 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:01.120
 again, two loops and again in broach 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.120
 adding a loop and so on until the end of the row 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.330
 after i add u 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.040
 I get 21 loops then no 21 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.100
 the loop will need to knit facial 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 loops after this again will need 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.049
 add loops loops will be added 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.930
 no longer through the two loops and three the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.540
 there i will tie 3 loops and instead 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.110
 broach add a fourth loop such 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.150
 I get 28 loops and so 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.150
 through gent will need to add to 7 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.910
 loops and so here i have tied a few 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.820
 rows 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.140
 I add already 8 and loops 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.880
 in each sector I originally had 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.560
 7 loops, respectively, I have 7 here 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.450
 such here 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.160
 Sectors where I do adding space 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.320
 additions are noticeable here 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.890
 so when you are some distance 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.150
 tie you will see where the loops 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.520
 add initially 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.540
 Of course it is better to consider when knitting 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.540
 very small
