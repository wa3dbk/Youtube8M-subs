00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
from fan + friend that are not nearly as

soft as this I will actually I will get

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.940 
soft as this I will actually I will get
them<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.200> show<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
them so that I can show you the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.770 
them so that I can show you the
difference<00:02:30.280> between<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.670> fur<00:02:30.880> here<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
difference between the fur here is the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.230 
difference between the fur here is the
fur<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> fan<00:02:32.860> +<00:02:33.100> friend<00:02:33.340> sock<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.940> have

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
fur on the fan + friend sock that I have

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.230 
fur on the fan + friend sock that I have
and<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.050> definitely<00:02:36.010> not<00:02:36.040> nearly<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.970> soft

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
and it is definitely not nearly as soft

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.320 
and it is definitely not nearly as soft
it<00:02:37.900> actually<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.680> kind<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.340> think<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.120> looks

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it actually I kind of think it looks

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.650 
it actually I kind of think it looks
much<00:02:40.690> cheaper<00:02:41.380> then<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.730> fur<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.270> was<00:02:43.450> used

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
much cheaper then the fur that was used

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.840 
much cheaper then the fur that was used
on<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.870> body<00:02:44.080> line<00:02:44.380> coat<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> definitely

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
on the body line coat so I definitely

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.500 
on the body line coat so I definitely
approve<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.860> for<00:02:48.340> body<00:02:48.790> line<00:02:49.030> has<00:02:49.210> chosen

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
approve of the for body line has chosen

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.230 
approve of the for body line has chosen
though<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.800> fur<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> sock<00:02:51.550> here<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.090> not

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
though this fur on the sock here I'm not

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.660 
though this fur on the sock here I'm not
sure<00:02:52.300> if<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.140> same<00:02:53.380> fur<00:02:53.710> that<00:02:54.460> is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
sure if this is the same fur that is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.790 
sure if this is the same fur that is
used<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.270> fan<00:02:55.690> +<00:02:55.930> red<00:02:56.140> coats<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:56.650> I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
used on the fan + red coats because I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.890 
used on the fan + red coats because I
don't<00:02:57.010> have<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> fan<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.700> end<00:02:57.940> coat<00:02:58.180> I'm<00:02:58.540> going

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
don't have a fan for end coat I'm going

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:16.870 
to put the coat on now and show you guys

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.330

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
all righty so now you see what the code

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.720 
all righty so now you see what the code
looks<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:19.730> worn<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:21.530> does<00:03:21.920> fit<00:03:22.490> me<00:03:22.700> very

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730

looks like worn and it does fit me very
well<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.870> purchased<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> coat<00:03:24.890> in<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.460> 2l<00:03:26.150> which

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
well I purchased the coat in a 2l which

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
well I purchased the coat in a 2l which
said<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.620> bust<00:03:27.860> was<00:03:28.100> 96<00:03:28.670> centimeters

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
said that the bust was 96 centimeters

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.350 
said that the bust was 96 centimeters
and<00:03:29.420> my<00:03:29.690> bust<00:03:30.050> with<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> sports<00:03:30.920> bra<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.520> 94

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
and my bust with the sports bra is 94

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.660 
and my bust with the sports bra is 94
centimeters<00:03:32.960> with<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> regular<00:03:33.980> bra<00:03:34.160> on<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
centimeters with a regular bra on I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.460 
centimeters with a regular bra on I
think<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.210> might<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.600> little<00:03:35.900> bit<00:03:36.170> snugger

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
think it might be a little bit snugger

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.880 
think it might be a little bit snugger
in<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.250> chest<00:03:37.580> but<00:03:38.240> with<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.420> sports<00:03:38.750> bra<00:03:39.020> I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
in the chest but with a sports bra I

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.070 
in the chest but with a sports bra I
think<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.310> fit<00:03:40.520> this<00:03:40.700> almost<00:03:41.180> perfectly<00:03:41.690> even

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
think I fit this almost perfectly even

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.710 
think I fit this almost perfectly even
if<00:03:42.200> you're<00:03:42.380> just<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.710> little<00:03:43.130> bit<00:03:43.580> over<00:03:44.120> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
if you're just a little bit over the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.140 
if you're just a little bit over the
9600<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.770> think<00:03:46.070> you'd<00:03:46.220> be<00:03:46.400> okay<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:46.820> this<00:03:46.910> code

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
9600 I think you'd be okay in this code

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940 
9600 I think you'd be okay in this code
oh<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.630> think<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:48.110> would<00:03:48.260> still<00:03:48.500> be<00:03:48.530> able<00:03:48.650> to

oh I think you would still be able to

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.460 
oh I think you would still be able to

get the coat on and button it one thing
that<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.710> was<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:51.920> little<00:03:52.070> nervous<00:03:52.310> about<00:03:52.610> with

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that I was a little nervous about with

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
had different zip up coats before so I

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.040 
had different zip up coats before so I
didn't<00:03:58.940> know<00:03:59.000> how<00:03:59.210> I<00:03:59.240> would<00:03:59.360> like<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.750> buttons

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
didn't know how I would like the buttons

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.080 
didn't know how I would like the buttons
and<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.350> thought<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.650> might<00:04:00.800> catch<00:04:01.100> or<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:02.060> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
and I thought they might catch or be a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.180 
and I thought they might catch or be a
little<00:04:02.330> difficult<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.110> work<00:04:03.350> with<00:04:03.410> but

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
little difficult to work with but

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.070 
little difficult to work with but
they're<00:04:04.400> not<00:04:04.640> they<00:04:05.090> are<00:04:05.270> really<00:04:05.690> easy<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
they're not they are really easy to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.950 
they're not they are really easy to
button<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.070> unbutton<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:07.910> I<00:04:07.940> have<00:04:08.210> no<00:04:08.480> issues

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
button and unbutton so I have no issues

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.230 
button and unbutton so I have no issues
there<00:04:09.170> whatsoever<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.060> has

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
there whatsoever I like that it has

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.860 
there whatsoever I like that it has
pockets<00:04:11.540> which<00:04:12.170> are<00:04:12.380> also<00:04:13.480> they<00:04:14.480> are<00:04:14.510> lined

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
pockets which are also they are lined

the<00:04:18.830> rest<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.520> coat<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.270> one<00:04:20.600> thing<00:04:20.840> that

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
the rest of the coat and one thing that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.200 
the rest of the coat and one thing that
I<00:04:21.020> was<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.290> little<00:04:21.500> disappointed<00:04:21.680> with<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.670> you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
I was a little disappointed with is you

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.420 
I was a little disappointed with is you
see<00:04:23.360> how<00:04:23.510> this<00:04:23.750> bow<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.440> really<00:04:24.830> great<00:04:25.130> and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
see how this bow is really great and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.420 
see how this bow is really great and
sewn<00:04:25.730> on<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:25.940> super<00:04:26.660> cute<00:04:26.990> well<00:04:27.650> this<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.100> is

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
sewn on and super cute well this one is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.100 
sewn on and super cute well this one is
sewn<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.480> but<00:04:29.990> not<00:04:30.620> quite<00:04:30.980> all<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.550> way<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:33.080> I

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
sewn on but not quite all the way so I

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.450 
sewn on but not quite all the way so I
think<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.590> was<00:04:33.680> probably<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.430> little

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
think that was probably just a little

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.370 
think that was probably just a little
mistake<00:04:34.760> though<00:04:35.420> it<00:04:35.810> makes<00:04:35.990> me<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.200> little

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
mistake though it makes me a little

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.770 
mistake though it makes me a little
disappointed<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:37.790> I'm<00:04:37.970> sure<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.300> was<00:04:38.420> just<00:04:38.660> a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
disappointed but I'm sure it was just a

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290 
disappointed but I'm sure it was just a
small<00:04:38.990> mistake<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:40.130> can<00:04:40.310> totally<00:04:40.910> fix<00:04:41.120> it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
small mistake and I can totally fix it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.690 
small mistake and I can totally fix it
myself<00:04:41.470> with<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.590> needle<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.920> thread<00:04:43.040> right

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
myself with a needle and thread right

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.610 
myself with a needle and thread right
now<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:43.910> am<00:04:44.300> wearing<00:04:44.480> two<00:04:44.870> fans<00:04:45.140> less<00:04:45.350> front

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
now I am wearing two fans less front

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.020 
now I am wearing two fans less front
petticoats<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.610> fits<00:04:46.880> me<00:04:47.090> really<00:04:48.080> well

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
petticoats and it fits me really well

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.510 
petticoats and it fits me really well
three<00:04:50.030> petticoats<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:51.050> don't<00:04:51.890> think<00:04:52.190> would<00:04:52.340> fit

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
three petticoats I don't think would fit

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.070 
three petticoats I don't think would fit
so<00:04:52.760> well<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.090> would<00:04:53.180> probably<00:04:53.210> start<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.900> look

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
so well it would probably start to look

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.580 
so well it would probably start to look
really<00:04:54.140> squashed<00:04:55.420> but<00:04:56.420> two<00:04:56.630> petticoats<00:04:57.170> and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
really squashed but two petticoats and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.560 
really squashed but two petticoats and
then<00:04:57.890> of<00:04:58.010> course<00:04:58.040> one<00:04:58.370> petticoat<00:04:58.820> is<00:04:59.060> just

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
then of course one petticoat is just

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.710 
then of course one petticoat is just
fine<00:04:59.780> these<00:05:00.080> cuffs<00:05:00.770> can<00:05:01.640> be<00:05:01.790> brought<00:05:02.030> down<00:05:02.240> so

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
fine these cuffs can be brought down so

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720 
fine these cuffs can be brought down so
if<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.110> wanted<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.590> little<00:05:03.740> extra<00:05:04.220> warmth<00:05:04.520> you

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
if you wanted a little extra warmth you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.090 
if you wanted a little extra warmth you
can<00:05:04.940> take<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.390> fur<00:05:05.630> down<00:05:06.110> over<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> hands

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
can take the fur down over the hands

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.860 
can take the fur down over the hands
another<00:05:07.820> thing<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.120> really<00:05:08.270> liked<00:05:08.540> about<00:05:08.660> the

adorable bow which I think really helps
