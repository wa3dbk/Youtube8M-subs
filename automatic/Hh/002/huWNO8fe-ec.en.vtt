00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.500
 Development road of new technology for customers 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.870
 Bearings to wedge make improvements of existing technology 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.530
 This video will be introduced to focus on the manufacturing process of d love in this video 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.180
 To do 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.670
 kingston is concerned with memory modules as a member of the genelec association 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.220
 Contributing to industry standard settings 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.270
 Kingston provides dedicated memory for non-standard devices in addition to memory compliant with industry standards. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.490
 Designed 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.360
 The 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:20.450
 Also offers custom memory solutions in response to customer needs 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:25.640
 These designs map individual layers of printed circuit boards to people 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.480
 For compatibility test and rooms It all starts with the design is complete 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.550
 Prototype products are achieved in the laboratory where the engineers take 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:41.760
 Body mother system or to test using the system + 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.020
 Systems and mothers used to test new technologies when dealing with compatibility confirmation and confirmation 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.549
 The board may not be available 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.700
 In that case use an advanced test platform These test engineers 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.750
 Designed by kingston's test engineer 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 Future system parameters using programmed software 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.350
 Simulate Leeam in Kingston 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.710
 What a controller 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.020
 This also applies to the aptitude determination of new components such as cash register assets and passive components. 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.190
 Use our test platform 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.970
 Plan is assembled after approval of design 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.370
 It will be sent to the production process for testing and packing 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:27.810
 kingston ranks 64 in the world 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:32.790
 Expand the production line of use has the ability to manufacture a three-country or more types of products in one year 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:39.000
 Because of the large number of products, their manufacturing process must be best in class 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:45.209
 kingston is the world's leading semiconductor and computer manufacturer as a contract manufacturer 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.800
 Manufactures memory for famous big companies who have cultivated their manufacturing processes from 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.030
 Kingston on exactly the same production line 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.620
 Products are also manufactured 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:03:01.010
 Through manufacturing test and each step of this 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.490
 Kingston has strict quality control gates to ensure compliance with its high standards 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.310
 I will 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.050
 The contract partner with Kingston's quality assurance team for each process 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.530
 Regular internal and external audits 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.160
 Maintain the highest standards in the industry without 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 Let's take a look at the manufacturing process of Kingston 's products 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:30.040
 First Kingston has 6 dealers of all configurations from world-class semiconductor manufacturers 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.050
 We procure raw materials including surface mount technology line and assembly of KANSUTO product happens 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.430
 I will recuperate 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:41.520
 The first step is a screen printer where solder paste is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:47.970
 It will be moved to the printed circuit board is applied to the entire stencil screen printed circuit board next to the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:49.620
 Height and integrity of the solder in there through the automated optical inspection station is stabbed deeply system care 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.069
 In the next step 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.879
 In line plane implementation 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:59.769
 Here is the first generation of two mounting machines 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:05.530
 Implement running components such as register 8 capacitors Next surface mount 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:11.060
 The machine implements the primary components such as d Nam chip of each 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:16.010
 Their base after mounting the chip on the printed circuit board there passes through the reflow oven 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.850
 Processed in seven temperature cycles up to 500 degrees imposed based on the specific design of the product 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.540
 I will 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:25.620
 Solder paste is cured by this profile to base 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.580
 After baking all products undergo a final automatic optical inspection 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:34.080
 The panel of the printed circuit board is removed when the inspection is completed 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:39.389
 Cut flights then extra panel in Kingston using a computer-controlled router source 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:45.180
 Separating devices The most unique step in the team stone process 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.610
 Is the product testing process test floor is equipped with a full set of test environment 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.599
 Somewhat 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.379
 Now, it is an automated design that has been patented by a low-profile man. 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:59.650
 kingston on test equipment and test related processes 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:05:00.370
 Katy 2100 is the first high- capacity automatic checkout tester with more than 29 patents 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.990
 And 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.600
 Developed by kingston Kingston's test engineer patented 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.960
 Get 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.740
 This system accommodates eight motherboards 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.740
 You can test up to 400 modules per hour 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:22.580
 t 2500 patented by kingston 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:28.220
 Ddr 3 will be used to test the memory in the final fully automated large-capacity system of 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.420
 This tester tests the 60 pieces of this module against per hour to accommodate the motherboard 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.590
 Can 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:39.320
 All other server grade memory products for production testing 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:46.280
 This unique experience that has acquired the need and technology videos patent to receive a burn-in test 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:49.440
 2400 test chamber for 3 months server Kuroko state in the center of the spirit city 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:55.230
 Noodle in a state where stress is generally received 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.310
 Stresses for the first time This allows screening of memory cells that are marginal or unnecessary 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:02.880
 Done 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:08.700
 Each cell in the early failure greatly reduced and 100 degrees or less 4 of 112 degrees Celsius 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.430
 Receives a test pattern during luxury then one failure at Kingston quality standards 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.670
 Research 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:17.440
 Actually, it is equal to one bad memory module 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:23.500
 Therefore, it is stipulated that it can not be shipped from the factory to the outside 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.060
 The 16 gb server memory module handles 1300 and is equipped with memory cells 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.639
 Given that 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:33.390
 You can see that Kingston's deputy office standards are unparalleledly high 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:39.510
 Products are packaged after retailers all over the world 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:44.370
 Good ice shop agency re-selling business users and will be shipped to the customer 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:48.300
 All of Kingston's manufacturing facilities are iso 9001 quality 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:53.380
 Environment and ISO 14001 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:56.800
 Accredited to the Health and Safety Standards of the King 18001 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:02.380
 Comply with loss and good environment requirements 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:06.960
 Commitments in the current and future on the quality of the Kings tone As you can see 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.960
 It can be said that it is at the core of the company's success
