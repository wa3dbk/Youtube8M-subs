what I was doing and they helped me put
up<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.620> lot<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.860> things<00:02:06.070> as<00:02:06.310> well<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.869> dry

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
up a lot of things as well I have dry

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.040 
up a lot of things as well I have dry
spells<00:02:08.440> all<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.890> time<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.729> guess<00:02:10.570> one<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.840> the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
spells all the time I guess one of the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.930 
spells all the time I guess one of the
things<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.500> I've<00:02:11.590> learned<00:02:11.830> recently<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.700> to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
things that I've learned recently is to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.970 
things that I've learned recently is to
just<00:02:13.150> set<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> timer

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
just set a timer

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.520 
just set a timer
put<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.070> up<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.310> thirty<00:02:15.670> minutes<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.330> just

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
put it up to thirty minutes and just

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.290 
put it up to thirty minutes and just
concentrate<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:18.070> push<00:02:18.670> yourself<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.180> do

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
concentrate and push yourself to do

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.150 
concentrate and push yourself to do
things<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.810> somehow<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.230> get<00:02:20.380> somewhere<00:02:20.740> so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
things and somehow you get somewhere so

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.470 
things and somehow you get somewhere so
I<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.280> process<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.330> really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
I think process it really is really

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
I think process it really is really
important<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.320> senses<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:24.340> all<00:02:24.490> about

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
important that senses it's all about

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.670 
important that senses it's all about
really<00:02:24.910> experimenting<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.320> know<00:02:26.440> just

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
really experimenting and you know just

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.140 
really experimenting and you know just
trying<00:02:26.920> things<00:02:27.010> out<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.550> pushing<00:02:27.850> itself

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
trying things out and pushing itself

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.490 
trying things out and pushing itself
what<00:02:29.020> inspires<00:02:29.470> me<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:31.380> experiencing<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
what inspires me is experiencing a

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.320 
what inspires me is experiencing a
different<00:02:33.100> culture<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> different<00:02:33.520> space<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.300> a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
different culture a different space of a

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.050 
different culture a different space of a
place<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> think<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.550> plugging<00:02:36.820> myself

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
place so I think just plugging myself

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.820 
place so I think just plugging myself
out<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.110> place<00:02:38.350> like<00:02:38.380> Shanghai

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
out and going to a place like Shanghai

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.160 
out and going to a place like Shanghai
where<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.940> inspired<00:02:40.480> me<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.930> things

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
where that inspired me to do things

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.620 
where that inspired me to do things
differently<00:02:41.590> as<00:02:41.920> designers<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:43.030> general<00:02:43.390> we

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
differently as designers in general we

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.090 
differently as designers in general we
get<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> bit<00:02:44.380> too<00:02:44.590> shy<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.580> reveal<00:02:46.150> ourselves<00:02:47.100> in

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
get a bit too shy to reveal ourselves in

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.890 
get a bit too shy to reveal ourselves in
general<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:50.050> like<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> keep<00:02:50.709> our<00:02:51.010> work<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
general we do like to keep our work and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.390 
general we do like to keep our work and
make<00:02:52.900> sure<00:02:53.080> things<00:02:53.350> are<00:02:53.440> perfect<00:02:53.890> before<00:02:54.130> we

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
make sure things are perfect before we

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.040 
make sure things are perfect before we
share<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.850> out<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.269> think<00:02:55.330> with<00:02:55.600> social

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
share it out and I think with social

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.050 
share it out and I think with social
media<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.590> okay<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.010> share<00:02:57.310> work<00:02:57.550> even<00:02:57.940> if

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
media it's okay to share work even if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.330 
media it's okay to share work even if
it's<00:02:58.180> unfinished<00:02:59.049> it's<00:02:59.590> okay<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.920> share<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
it's unfinished it's okay to share it

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.039 
it's unfinished it's okay to share it
process<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.970> what<00:03:01.570> I've<00:03:01.660> learned<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.019> that

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
process and what I've learned is that

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.590 
process and what I've learned is that
the<00:03:02.470> process<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:03.790> interesting<00:03:04.360> as<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
the process is as interesting as the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.470 
the process is as interesting as the
finished<00:03:04.930> piece<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.650> art<00:03:06.010> or<00:03:06.220> work<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:07.299> that's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
finished piece of art or work and that's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.880 
finished piece of art or work and that's
what<00:03:07.660> people<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.080> see<00:03:08.320> they<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.739> see

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
what people like to see they like to see

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.199 
what people like to see they like to see
a<00:03:08.920> little<00:03:09.220> bumps<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.519> mistakes<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.090> things

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
a little bumps and mistakes and things

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.430 
a little bumps and mistakes and things
like<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.690> how<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.840> get<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.200> your<00:03:11.290> final

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
like that and how you get to your final

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.090 
like that and how you get to your final
product<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.160> think<00:03:12.610> definitely<00:03:13.360> plays<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.650> huge

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
product I think definitely plays a huge

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.750 
product I think definitely plays a huge
role<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.489> making<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:16.239> space<00:03:16.510> more<00:03:16.870> interesting

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
role in making a space more interesting

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.120 
role in making a space more interesting
and<00:03:18.760> fun
