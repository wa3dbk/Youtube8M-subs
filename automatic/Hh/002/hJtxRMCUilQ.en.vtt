00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.229
 Well today I'm bringing you a complement for the mozilla firefox 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.530
 which serves to block or eliminate the damn advertising that always walks 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.949
 bothering 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.419
 well, good 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.429
 the description of the video goes to the limit 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 as you can see it is from the official mozilla page 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.480
 as you can see 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.499
 the add-on is called adp bloc 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.019
 in the version 1 points 2 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.740
 well to install it in firefox they click on the button that says add to 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.080
 firefox 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.500
 and the installation window will appear, click on install and the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 installation and now restart your mozilla firefox 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.080
 I canceled it because I already have it 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.830
 after restarting the program they will not be able to find tools 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 plus or you can see its icon in the upper right 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 well I'll give you an example of how to block advertising 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 they click on the add-on icon and it will open a new window in the part 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.930
 bottom of mozilla firefox 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.180
 now suppose that the icon of the add-on on the page is a 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 advertising 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.850
 Then click on the links below to find the link 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 who want to block 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 usually when clicking on a link, the element is marked in dotted line 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.190
 to block it right click to block this item 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 and will open a new window there we can see how to block the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.420
 element 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.549
 the first option is to only block that element 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.830
 the second to block items before the link that marks 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.050
 the third same as the second to block items before the link 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.450
 what brand 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.340
 the fourth 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.600
 to block the fixed link 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.720
 the fifth for all the pages of the source page 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.880
 and the sixth customized 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.649
 choose the first option since I only want to block that element 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 ok we give in add filter 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.170
 Now update the page to see the results on the page 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.629
 after removing the item 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.069
 as we can see the element is no longer charged nor does it appear in the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.129
 page 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.789
 although we look for it so long 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.849
 xd xd xd xd 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 to unblock it right click on the blocked link and click disable 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.719
 this filter 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.299
 I will update the page and we will see how the element will be again 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.559
 although after blocking an item usually advertising I do not think that 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.559
 you want to unlock 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.519
 that was it 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.789
