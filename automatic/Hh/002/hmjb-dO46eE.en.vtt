 Clara once you meet a doctor and 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.289
 Of course, this is the best day. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.269
 a day in your life because you are 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.540
 crazy and most importantly you to him on 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 really need the most important thing not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.770
 fall in love and I often do it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 sometimes twice a day and when you 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.070
 you start to run then with time 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.789
 you forget slowly gradually and 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.789
 stop asking 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:11.770

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.770

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 where is it going 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.590
 I learned the truth about the doctor and his 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.680
 the greatest secret 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.680

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.100

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.820
 I met her in the refuge of the Daleks 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.680

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.900
