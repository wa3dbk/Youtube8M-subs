to second let me just find the volcano
so<00:05:51.930> much<00:05:52.110> lag

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.230 

so<00:06:00.120> much<00:06:00.270> lag<00:06:00.600> right<00:06:00.810> now<00:06:01.020> let's<00:06:01.920> just<00:06:02.040> add<00:06:02.550> the

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
so much lag right now let's just add the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.660 
so much lag right now let's just add the
bucket<00:06:03.540> of<00:06:03.630> water<00:06:03.810> to<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:05.310> top<00:06:06.290> block<00:06:07.580> so<00:06:08.580> that

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
bucket of water to the top block so that

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.960 
bucket of water to the top block so that
the<00:06:08.820> water<00:06:09.030> will<00:06:09.240> go<00:06:09.450> down<00:06:09.720> and<00:06:10.460> then<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:11.490> sit

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
the water will go down and then just sit

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.370 
the water will go down and then just sit
back<00:06:12.270> and<00:06:12.780> watch
