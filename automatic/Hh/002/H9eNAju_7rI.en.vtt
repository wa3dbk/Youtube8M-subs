00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
out Julia basically how you're going to

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.869 
out Julia basically how you're going to
sound<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> gravel<00:04:06.239> bar<00:04:07.519> basically<00:04:08.519> you

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
sound for a gravel bar basically you

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.240 
sound for a gravel bar basically you
want<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.180> lean<00:04:09.330> more<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> front<00:04:10.260> for<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
want to lean more to the front for the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.559 
want to lean more to the front for the
point<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.879> gravel<00:04:12.269> bar<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:14.220> can<00:04:14.370> see<00:04:14.569> got

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
point to the gravel bar you can see got

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.680 
point to the gravel bar you can see got
a<00:04:15.629> fairly<00:04:16.079> decent<00:04:16.790> current<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:17.940> travels<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
a fairly decent current that travels to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.200 
a fairly decent current that travels to
here<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.979> make<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.190> cut<00:04:22.610> I'm<00:04:23.610> basically<00:04:24.000> going

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
here to make a cut I'm basically going

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.570 
here to make a cut I'm basically going
to<00:04:24.300> go<00:04:24.419> about<00:04:24.660> five<00:04:24.990> feet<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.949> off<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
to go about five feet back off of the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.930 
to go about five feet back off of the
point<00:04:26.850> here<00:04:28.070> then<00:04:29.070> I'm<00:04:29.250> going<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.490> trench<00:04:29.790> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
point here then I'm going to trench a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.680 
point here then I'm going to trench a
line<00:04:30.150> right<00:04:30.450> across<00:04:31.100> this<00:04:32.100> area<00:04:32.370> just<00:04:33.360> doing

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
line right across this area just doing

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.659 
line right across this area just doing
the<00:04:33.780> surface<00:04:34.169> gravel<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.780> about<00:04:36.990> every<00:04:37.350> foot

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
the surface gravel and about every foot

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.000 
the surface gravel and about every foot
across<00:04:38.669> I'll<00:04:39.060> do<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> pan<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:40.650> what<00:04:40.800> kind

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
across I'll do a pan and see what kind

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.030 
across I'll do a pan and see what kind
of<00:04:41.100> color<00:04:41.250> shows<00:04:41.639> up<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.150> each<00:04:42.300> pound<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.919> that

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
of color shows up in each pound and that

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.010 
of color shows up in each pound and that
should<00:04:44.280> basically<00:04:44.580> lean<00:04:45.150> me<00:04:45.330> towards<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
should basically lean me towards the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.070 
should basically lean me towards the
area<00:04:46.639> where<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.760> Gold's<00:04:48.090> travel<00:04:48.540> usually<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
area where the Gold's travel usually the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.990 
area where the Gold's travel usually the
gold<00:04:49.289> will<00:04:49.530> travel<00:04:49.860> a<00:04:50.389> defined<00:04:51.389> line<00:04:53.000> but

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
gold will travel a defined line but

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.779 
gold will travel a defined line but
we'll<00:04:54.180> get<00:04:54.300> dig<00:04:54.539> in<00:04:54.690> here<00:04:55.130> topple<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.280> up<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
we'll get dig in here topple this up and

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.080 
we'll get dig in here topple this up and
see<00:04:57.090> what<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.479> fine<00:04:57.750> I'll<00:04:58.320> show<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.669> if<00:04:59.669> I<00:04:59.880> can

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
see what the fine I'll show you if I can

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.200 
see what the fine I'll show you if I can
find<00:05:00.270> an<00:05:00.479> actual<00:05:01.130> small<00:05:02.130> pay<00:05:02.370> streak<00:05:02.729> of<00:05:02.940> gold

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
find an actual small pay streak of gold

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.370 
find an actual small pay streak of gold
across<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.990> bar<00:05:04.950> here<00:05:05.840> okay<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.320> just

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
across the bar here okay so I just

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.670 
across the bar here okay so I just
finished<00:05:08.810> sampling<00:05:09.810> this<00:05:10.020> little<00:05:10.380> corner

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
finished sampling this little corner

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.000 
finished sampling this little corner
here<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.510> see<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.720> type<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.620> trench

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
here and you can see a type of trench

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.900 
here and you can see a type of trench
across<00:05:15.289> and<00:05:16.289> basically<00:05:16.830> where<00:05:17.099> my<00:05:17.310> shovel<00:05:17.729> is

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
across and basically where my shovel is

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.379 
across and basically where my shovel is
is<00:05:18.180> where<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> found<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.680> most<00:05:19.889> gold<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:21.090> the

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
is where I found the most gold and the

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.190 
is where I found the most gold and the
