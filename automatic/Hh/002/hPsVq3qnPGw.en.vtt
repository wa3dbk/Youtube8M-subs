00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
 but people and then he comes up with a new list to the scene 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.540
 in the first trojan age deceased is split tnt also one 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 skipping rope in english 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.849
 and 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.369
 how you can easily get a nice effect that the photo had 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.340
 romantic is promoted 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 Then you can learn something 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 traps stores give synonyms a little inspiration 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.580
 with this photo that it is really done so you can also see that the hair is the 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.329
 what the bar plate 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.670
 I like that 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.680
 I also did this mistake to the head because you are supposed to make it look like that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440
 appear to look like 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.250
 a 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.720
 yes it worked out well 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.490
 also an alternative not classics also always beautiful sexy model in between 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.600
 nothing and let the rest of it catch itself 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.810
 but do it 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.970
 here again I have not used it anymore and you can also see that it is a film 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.940
 afraid it will give a very scared perfect 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.860
 well it goes with this photo 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.770
 been for me with this 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.390
 the split shades 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 and then click on that box next to high 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.509
 then you are going to run a hemp farm here you will get the c4 coloring 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.270
 what had actually happened is this 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 sign you go exactly to the seven-year stress 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.470
 the failure not once 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 let more come and had more press if you see too 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.550
 well me by quite a lot of members 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 I find that here 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 and my client is still too high this year that you can still do with the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.560
 shadow the horny click you have 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.190
 the iran 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.760
 and so you have what is worth you have this punch in its perfect 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 10 perfect place 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.539
 here also color saturation beets should something go down click here 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.120
 not too many bumps then 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.330
 it is a bit exaggerated 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.900
 and that movie so well actually you have the fire here too 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.790
 I myself have the effect that always gives vim if it is bad again 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.519
 is actually a kind of versa saturation 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.239
 between those two years 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.569
 but really just not late anymore 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.879
 then it is also good 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.879
 one after the other I am a fan of ten years 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.139
 if you read here at the little black church 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.059
 that looks nice but it fit more time 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.539
 and if you follow a white spot drop 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.949
 so you see 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.769
 You can see that he is better here, but you can also see that one 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.779
 the glow of that seven-year color must also go 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:43.590
 there is a little used then I get it possible to see his stain 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.349
 you now see that it falls 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.629
 dreaminess a bit more romantic 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.259
 axes anp 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.939
 you are still a reporting center here 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.799
 lobster change 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.219
 something like that 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.179
 the ending 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.999
 suzy you see 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.889
 yes I can 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.069
 and surcharges you have in my heart 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.159
 but i like soft 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.999
 block like your 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.819
 and is the end result 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.389
 just not look grim just before looking 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.129
 next to your favorites and then my sick mind the next edition 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.499
 with the new policy
