00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
scars I've talked about baking soda a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
scars I've talked about baking soda a
few<00:00:11.849> times<00:00:12.059> before<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.780> now<00:00:13.110> I'm<00:00:13.290> kind<00:00:13.559> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
few times before and now I'm kind of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.099 
few times before and now I'm kind of
questioning<00:00:14.370> whether<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.210> fully<00:00:15.690> recommend

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
questioning whether I fully recommend

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.769 
questioning whether I fully recommend
baking<00:00:16.560> soda<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.130> reason<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.180> say<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
baking soda the reason I say that is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300 
baking soda the reason I say that is
because<00:00:18.930> I've<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:19.590> more<00:00:19.740> research<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
because I've got some more research and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
because I've got some more research and
I've<00:00:21.000> heard<00:00:21.210> some<00:00:21.359> people<00:00:21.480> say<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> baking

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I've heard some people say that baking

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.830 
I've heard some people say that baking
soda<00:00:22.519> removes<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> natural<00:00:23.850> oils<00:00:24.539> from<00:00:24.720> your

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
good with that being said I probably

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.010 
good with that being said I probably
would<00:00:57.180> recommend<00:00:57.600> sea<00:00:57.840> salt<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.289> Epsom<00:00:58.949> salt

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
would recommend sea salt or Epsom salt

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.200 
would recommend sea salt or Epsom salt
more<00:01:01.020> than<00:01:01.379> baking<00:01:02.039> soda<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.430> epson<00:01:03.000> salt

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
more than baking soda because epson salt

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.039 
more than baking soda because epson salt
sea<00:01:03.420> soap<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:04.159> just<00:01:05.510> they're<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.540> solved

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
sea soap are just they're just solved

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.710 
sea soap are just they're just solved
they're<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> mineral<00:01:08.250> based<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.510> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
they're the mineral based and it's just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
they're the mineral based and it's just
it<00:01:09.990> does<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> same<00:01:10.890> thing<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.280> baking

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it does really the same thing as baking

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.649 
it does really the same thing as baking
soda<00:01:12.530> except<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> mineral

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
soda except for it's like it's a mineral

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
soda except for it's like it's a mineral
base<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.200> even<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.439> natural<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
base so it's even more natural and it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
base so it's even more natural and it
would<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> would<00:01:18.869> mess<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
would I don't think it would mess is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
would I don't think it would mess is
mess<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> oils<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.759> skin<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.119> much

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
mess with the oils in your skin as much

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.249 
mess with the oils in your skin as much
from<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.290> experience<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> research<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
from from my experience in research so I

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.690 
from from my experience in research so I
take<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.619> take<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> grain<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
take you know take that with a grain of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.749 
take you know take that with a grain of
salt<00:01:26.990> literally<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> figuratively<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
salt literally and figuratively but I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.929 
salt literally and figuratively but I
said<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> recommend<00:01:30.840> sea<00:01:31.110> salt<00:01:31.439> or

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
said I would say I recommend sea salt or

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.830 
said I would say I recommend sea salt or
essence<00:01:32.939> thought<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.810> a

one container it's kind of gritty

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
one container it's kind of gritty
