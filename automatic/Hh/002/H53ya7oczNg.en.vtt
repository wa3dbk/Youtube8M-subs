 christ the 3d cinema war winter that is a passive 3d technique 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.979
 And that works differently from the 18 14 to 30 hours we have to the manufacturer 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.140
 He is also the first manufacturer to use the term Englishman with such a system 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.720
 coming 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720

 depressions 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.560
 In addition, the TV also has fresh marketing, which is the Internet 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.240
 tanzi area 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.690
 thereby also gain access to the internet services such as the youtube 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.250
 twitter and facebook 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 In addition, there is a pass saving that lets you in that smart wi fi environment 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.600
 can easily operate a course through exercise 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.500
 of this accessory smoking ban first impression on our website 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.570
 stand 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.330
 cinema 3D drinking then sees it as one of the first manufacturers 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.750
 Netherlands TV on the market with the so-called 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 nevertheless sees the 3d technology 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 with this technique 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.260
 crediting the cheap lightweight the honest guy 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.540
 the contrast to the somewhat heavier active 3d 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 expected on other televisions and other manufacturers 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.370
 what we are seen so far it also works great just very well 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.550
 look at an idea 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.210
 that is true that this technique 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.390
 reducing the resolution by 35 is not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 also but at a good distance four home often have caught two compliments you see 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.210

 it is true that 3d 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 top fries horse 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.890
 I also have a price tag on that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 this model leaves the store for this 100 euros 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.539
 that is the suggested retail price 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.799
 but this year we also see smaller ones to fear that 32 will come to the store 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.539
 have the 3d function in ski resort 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:22.759
 well this year we will also include in our test 3d as part and 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.319
 In addition, Patrol puts the TV and therefore the various 3D techniques in addition 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.559
 each other in different aspects such as viewing angle and sharpness 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.229
 how good is it about 3d 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.559
