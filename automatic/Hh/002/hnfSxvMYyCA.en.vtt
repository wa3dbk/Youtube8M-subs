00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the s3 this is exactly the same so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
the s3 this is exactly the same so
basically<00:01:45.000> looks<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.390> model<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> phone

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
after the s3 it's a cheaper version of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.090 
after the s3 it's a cheaper version of
it<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
it this is

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.859 
it this is
actually<00:01:51.280> running<00:01:51.460> through<00:01:51.549> boost<00:01:52.060> which<00:01:52.720> I

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
actually running through boost which I

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually running through boost which I
have<00:01:52.990> not<00:01:53.170> had<00:01:53.439> any<00:01:53.710> problems<00:01:53.830> with<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:55.180> far

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
before I had boost I had straight talk

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.510 
before I had boost I had straight talk
the<00:01:59.170> Walmart<00:01:59.530> branch<00:01:59.710> Straight<00:02:00.009> Talk<00:02:00.040> and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
it's kind of funny because I get

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.600 
it's kind of funny because I get
serviced<00:02:04.210> everywhere<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:05.320> boosts<00:02:05.860> with

serviced everywhere with boosts with
straight<00:02:06.970> talk<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.509> wouldn't<00:02:08.380> get<00:02:08.440> serviced<00:02:08.920> at

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039

straight talk I wouldn't get serviced at
Walmart<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:10.300> some<00:02:10.479> reason<00:02:10.810> even<00:02:10.929> though<00:02:11.050> it's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
Walmart for some reason even though it's

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.449 
Walmart for some reason even though it's
a<00:02:11.230> Walmart<00:02:11.620> brand<00:02:11.800> every<00:02:11.980> time<00:02:12.160> I'd<00:02:12.280> go<00:02:12.400> to

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
a Walmart brand every time I'd go to

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.610 
a Walmart brand every time I'd go to
Walmart<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.030> would<00:02:13.180> lose<00:02:13.360> signal<00:02:13.900> inside<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
Walmart I would lose signal inside of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.740 
Walmart I would lose signal inside of
Walmart<00:02:15.069> or<00:02:15.220> around<00:02:15.730> Walmart<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.450> was<00:02:16.540> really

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
Walmart or around Walmart it was really

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.930 
Walmart or around Walmart it was really
weird<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.370> no<00:02:18.520> problems<00:02:18.910> getting

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
weird but I have no problems getting

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.330 
weird but I have no problems getting
signal<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.050> far<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.590> don't

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
signal with this one and so far I don't

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
signal with this one and so far I don't
think<00:02:21.489> I've<00:02:21.550> encountered<00:02:21.760> anywhere<00:02:22.239> outside

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
think I've encountered anywhere outside

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.350 
think I've encountered anywhere outside
that<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> don't<00:02:23.920> get<00:02:24.069> signal<00:02:24.550> or<00:02:24.730> service<00:02:25.239> or

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
that I don't get signal or service or

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.479 
that I don't get signal or service or
anything<00:02:25.510> like<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> internet<00:02:27.160> speeds

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
anything like that the internet speeds

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.610 
anything like that the internet speeds
are<00:02:27.670> decent<00:02:28.510> enough<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.870> mean<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.170> oome<00:02:29.350> only

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
are decent enough I mean it's oome only

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.940 
are decent enough I mean it's oome only
runs<00:02:29.860> 3G<00:02:30.519> on<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.880> which<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.019> kind<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.260> lame<00:02:32.530> but

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
runs 3G on it which is kind of lame but

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.100 
runs 3G on it which is kind of lame but
whatever<00:02:34.019> but<00:02:35.760> only<00:02:36.760> downside<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.840> phone

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
whatever but only downside to this phone

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.710 
whatever but only downside to this phone
that<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:38.530> found<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.010> far<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.370> only<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
that I have found so far the only one is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.910 
that I have found so far the only one is
that<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.310> incapable<00:02:43.140> -<00:02:44.140> right<00:02:44.620> out<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.799> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
that it is incapable - right out of the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.170 
that it is incapable - right out of the
box<00:02:45.130> move<00:02:45.880> apps<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.630> SD<00:02:46.989> card<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:49.030> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
box move apps the SD card so if you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.360 
box move apps the SD card so if you
download<00:02:49.390> an<00:02:49.780> app<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.350> need<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> be<00:02:50.650> careful<00:02:50.890> I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
download an app you need to be careful I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.670 
download an app you need to be careful I
think<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:51.940> only<00:02:52.000> got<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.450> about<00:02:52.690> 2<00:02:53.260> gigs<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
think it's only got like about 2 gigs of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.370 
think it's only got like about 2 gigs of
on-board<00:02:53.890> storage<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:55.959> move<00:02:56.110> all<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
on-board storage you can move all you

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.780 
on-board storage you can move all you
have<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.620> manually<00:02:56.950> move<00:02:57.190> all<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.489> your<00:02:57.610> music

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
have to manually move all of your music

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.680 
have to manually move all of your music
over<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.560> SD<00:02:59.860> card<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.190> can<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.690> but

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
over to the SD card you can do that but

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.220 
over to the SD card you can do that but
it<00:03:02.530> doesn't<00:03:03.299> move<00:03:04.299> at<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.660> can't<00:03:04.900> move<00:03:05.049> apps

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
it doesn't move at you can't move apps

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.699 
it doesn't move at you can't move apps
there's<00:03:05.470> no<00:03:05.739> options<00:03:06.190> anywhere<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.030> move<00:03:07.209> apps

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
there's no options anywhere to move apps

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.750 
there's no options anywhere to move apps
so<00:03:08.709> you'd<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.310> get<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.670> have

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
so you'd have you have to get you have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.729 
so you'd have you have to get you have
to<00:03:09.820> route<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.510> get<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.690> third-party<00:03:11.200> app<00:03:11.500> to

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
to route it and get a third-party app to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.000 
to route it and get a third-party app to
do<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.209> only<00:03:13.420> way<00:03:13.810> I've<00:03:14.709> been<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010
