I'm wondering if service pack updates
that<00:00:34.480> at<00:00:34.690> all<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.909> other<00:00:37.030> thing<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.510> found

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
that at all and the other thing I found

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.030 
that at all and the other thing I found

set<00:00:51.790> on<00:00:52.049> HDTV<00:00:53.049> here<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.610> a<00:00:54.640> v1<00:00:55.360> which<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
set on HDTV here for a v1 which is the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.369 
set on HDTV here for a v1 which is the
back<00:00:56.080> panel<00:00:56.729> composite<00:00:57.809> okay<00:00:59.430> no<00:01:00.430> signal<00:01:01.379> when

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
back panel composite okay no signal when

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.280 
back panel composite okay no signal when
we<00:01:02.500> went<00:01:02.739> through<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:03.100> side<00:01:03.900> panel<00:01:04.900> which<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
we went through the side panel which is

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.910 
we went through the side panel which is
the<00:01:05.439> second<00:01:05.830> set<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.930> composite<00:01:07.930> next<00:01:08.799> to

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
the second set of the composite next to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.789 
the second set of the composite next to
the<00:01:09.009> component<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.049> signal<00:01:11.439> so

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
the component I have a signal so

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.160 
the component I have a signal so
obviously<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.790> input<00:01:13.150> jack<00:01:13.180> seemed<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:14.049> be

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
obviously the input jack seemed to be

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.840 
obviously the input jack seemed to be
damaged<00:01:14.650> here<00:01:14.920> because<00:01:15.159> I<00:01:15.280> should<00:01:15.490> be<00:01:15.579> getting

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
damaged here because I should be getting

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.140 
damaged here because I should be getting
a<00:01:15.970> signal<00:01:16.390> from<00:01:16.420> my<00:01:16.630> VCR<00:01:17.140> right<00:01:17.350> now<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:21.150> b2

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
a signal from my VCR right now just a b2

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.899 
a signal from my VCR right now just a b2
I<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> signal<00:01:25.390> see<00:01:25.990> AV<00:01:26.980> 2<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.640> side

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
I got a signal see AV 2 is on the side

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.330 
I got a signal see AV 2 is on the side
and<00:01:28.240> not<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.690> bottom<00:01:28.840> back<00:01:29.620> Jack's<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.310> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and not on the bottom back Jack's in the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.920 
and not on the bottom back Jack's in the
back<00:01:30.640> panel<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:36.190> could<00:01:36.550> well<00:01:36.940> be<00:01:36.970> this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
back panel so it could well be this

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.399 
back panel so it could well be this
whole<00:01:38.310> side<00:01:39.360> Jack's<00:01:40.360> except<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> digital

whole side Jack's except for the digital

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.969 
whole side Jack's except for the digital
output<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.950> seems<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.370> work

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
output it seems to work

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.610 
output it seems to work
been<00:01:44.979> able<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.280> get<00:01:45.550> -<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.900> component<00:01:47.500> is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
been able to get - the component is

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.789 
been able to get - the component is
actually<00:01:47.830> over<00:01:48.250> here<00:01:48.280> though<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:50.290> are

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
actually over here though so these are

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.640 
actually over here though so these are
not<00:01:50.979> getting<00:01:51.430> input<00:01:51.640> from<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.720> these<00:01:53.080> are<00:01:53.470> not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
not getting input from and these are not

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.180 
not getting input from and these are not
getting<00:01:53.979> input<00:01:54.159> from<00:01:54.370> putting<00:01:54.760> in<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.000> video

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190
