think we're still down by two and I got

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.610 
think we're still down by two and I got
the<00:01:20.330> ball<00:01:20.510> on<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.780> run<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.440> really

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
the ball on the run and I just really

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.100
