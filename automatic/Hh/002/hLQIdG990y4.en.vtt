and i bought it because it got a great
camera<00:00:30.050> but<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.560> camisole<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
camera but because it camisole I the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.139 
camera but because it camisole I the
image<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.440> always<00:00:34.620> shaky<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.989> if<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.140> turn<00:00:37.380> on

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
image is always shaky and if you turn on

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
image is always shaky and if you turn on
image<00:00:39.149> stabilizer<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.129> doesn't<00:00:41.550> work

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
image stabilizer it really doesn't work

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
image stabilizer it really doesn't work
so<00:00:42.030> well<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.940> reduces<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.600> camp<00:00:46.550> quality

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so well and it reduces the camp quality

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.650 
so well and it reduces the camp quality
of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> video<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.480> easy

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of the video so I got this and it's easy

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.069 
of the video so I got this and it's easy

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.820 

see

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.760 

so<00:01:22.760> like<00:01:22.940> I<00:01:22.970> said<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:23.360> only<00:01:23.570> used<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.110> pass<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.620> it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
so like I said I only used to pass of it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.040 
so like I said I only used to pass of it
now<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.850> goes<00:01:29.240> about<00:01:31.030> up<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.420> my<00:01:32.570> shoulder

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.710 
now it goes about up to my shoulder
height<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:35.240> let's<00:01:35.810> see<00:01:36.110> how<00:01:36.400> stable<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:38.660> is

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
height so let's see how stable it is

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:50.410 
height so let's see how stable it is
with<00:01:39.290> me<00:01:39.530> while<00:01:39.890> moving<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.460> around<00:01:49.300> there<00:01:50.300> we

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
with me while moving it around there we

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.920 
with me while moving it around there we
go

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.160 

30<00:01:54.930> bucks<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> bad<00:01:55.920> deal

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:20.160 

to<00:02:01.830> make<00:02:02.960> camera<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:05.220> home<00:02:05.430> useful

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.740 

you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.410 

so<00:02:25.560> yeah<00:02:26.330> without<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.510> moving<00:02:28.410> along<00:02:29.420> names

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so yeah without the moving along names

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.990 
so yeah without the moving along names
quality<00:02:31.140> should<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.710> better<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.760> don't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
quality should be better because I don't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.700 
quality should be better because I don't
need<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.510> use<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:34.680> stabilizer<00:02:35.640> function<00:02:36.710> it's

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
need to use the stabilizer function it's

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:51.120 
need to use the stabilizer function it's
actually<00:02:37.940> reduces<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.260> resolution

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.490 

let's<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.960> this<00:02:53.020> means<00:02:53.560> long

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:08.980 

turning<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.430> down

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:27.200 

that's<00:03:09.990> going<00:03:10.230> back<00:03:10.590> up<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.930> go

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.090 

for<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.320> skies<00:03:28.770> will<00:03:29.130> master<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:31.890> can

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
for the skies will master see if you can

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:44.410 
for the skies will master see if you can
see<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.450> guy<00:03:33.450> go

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.550 

does<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.410> seem<00:03:45.709> natural<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:04.340 

because<00:03:51.560> it's<00:03:51.800> really<00:03:52.099> not

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350
