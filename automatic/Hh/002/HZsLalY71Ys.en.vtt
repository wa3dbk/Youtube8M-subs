00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
out of me because it's like okay success

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
aren't I now to be honest with you I
think<00:01:27.090> partially<00:01:27.390> something<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.290> with

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
think partially something to do with

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
think partially something to do with
this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> few<00:01:29.430> months<00:01:29.490> back<00:01:29.909> there

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this is because a few months back there

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.560 
this is because a few months back there
was<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.040> supposedly<00:01:32.040> khajur<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.090> ending<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
was a supposedly khajur the ending of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
was a supposedly khajur the ending of
attack<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.020> Titan<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> big

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
attack on Titan and a lot of big

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
attack on Titan and a lot of big
mysteries<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.880> honestly<00:01:36.270> wouldn't<00:01:36.479> be

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
mysteries and I honestly wouldn't be

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
mysteries and I honestly wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:37.950> was

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
surprised if that was actually what was

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
surprised if that was actually what was
going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> happen<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.850> due<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.540> him<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.900> know

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.180 
I'm a bit disappointed but as long as it
comes<00:04:07.390> out<00:04:07.600> good<00:04:07.840> I'll<00:04:08.079> be<00:04:08.440> fine<00:04:08.739> with<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:08.980> but

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
comes out good I'll be fine with it but

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.650 
comes out good I'll be fine with it but
it's<00:04:09.340> like<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.640> think<00:04:09.880> he<00:04:10.180> should<00:04:10.329> just<00:04:10.359> stick

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
it's like I think he should just stick

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.750 
it's like I think he should just stick
to<00:04:10.720> his<00:04:10.989> gut<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:12.130> know<00:04:12.220> just<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:12.579> what<00:04:12.730> he

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.280 
to his gut and you know just do what he
set<00:04:13.120> out<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.269> do<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> beginning<00:04:14.019> what<00:04:14.200> do

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
set out to do in the beginning what do

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.150 
set out to do in the beginning what do
you<00:04:14.350> guys<00:04:14.440> think<00:04:14.680> do<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:14.829> think<00:04:14.980> he<00:04:15.130> should

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
you guys think do you think he should

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.099 
you guys think do you think he should
just<00:04:15.459> stick<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.820> what<00:04:15.940> he<00:04:15.970> had<00:04:16.180> in<00:04:16.299> mind<00:04:16.329> or<00:04:16.720> you
