[Soft rock music]

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt;ADAM: Dad, you know, quite a few famous
people

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.000
have been commencement speakers at Ohio State.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.300
What does it mean to you to be the commencement
speaker this year?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.260
Well, first of all, I'm totally
honored to be speaker at commencement.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.300
You know, it takes me back to 1986, when my
former football coach here,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590
Woody Hayes, was asked to speak at commencement.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.410
I'll never forget he called me and let me
know

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.559
that President Jennings had asked him to be
the speaker,

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.850
and I'll never forget how emotional he was
about that.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.500
And when President Drake finished his conversation
with me

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.320
in regards to me being the speaker, when I
hung up that phone, I kind of felt like Woody.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.589
I was overwhelmed, really surprised to be
asked,

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.320
but at the same time tremendously honored.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.520
Adam, I know that I was your commencement
speaker at your high school graduation.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.440
&gt;&gt;ADAM: Yeah.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.210
&gt;&gt;ARCHIE GRIFFIN: How do you feel about me doing
it again?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050
It's kind of the second go-around
here,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.920
I kind of got used to it the first time in
high school.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.780
I'm just kind of hoping that you don't say
the same stories over again at commencement,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.180
and kind of let me snooze through that one
as well. [Laughs]

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.220
[Laughs] Ohh… Well, hopefully
I won't have you snoozing.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.200
But I tell you what, I'm looking forward to
speaking at your commencement,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.649
and hopefully you'll get something out of
what your old man says.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.079
[Laughs] I'm sure I will.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.969
It's always great, you know, when I walk up
there,

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.159
I get to shake me old man's hand when I walk
across that stage

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.020
and finally get my college diploma here.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.400
&gt;&gt;ARCHIE GRIFFIN: Alright.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.659
&gt;&gt;ADAM: Dad, you've said that earning
your degree from the Ohio State University

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.329
is your greatest achievement while at Ohio
State.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.590
What does having that degree mean to you?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.810
&gt;&gt;ARCHIE GRIFFIN: Well, it means a tremendous amount
to me.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.299
First of all, it means I reached a goal that
I wanted to reach.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.369
You know, and I've told you many times,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.030
I love the game of football and I played the
game of football,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.369
but football was the vehicle I used to get
the education that I wanted.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.869
But what it means to me is I'm a part of something
bigger than myself,

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.210
I'm part of a huge network- there's over 500,000
living alumni from Ohio State,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.550
a powerful group of alumni.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.220
And that means connections, and that means
that anytime that I go anywhere in the world,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.960
if I want to find an Ohio State graduate alumnus
of Ohio State University, I can do that.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.750
But the key to that is always staying connected
to the university in some sort of way,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.660
so I know that this degree that I've gotten
from Ohio State

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.000
will help me stay connected to the university,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.860
and that vast network of alumni that we have
at this university.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.970
Now YOU are going to become alumnus of the
Ohio State University,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.630
you've got many family members who are alums,
what does it mean to you?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.970
Being an alumnus of the Ohio
State University

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.650
means pretty much the world to me.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.410
I don't know that it was an option to not
get my degree, once I started at Ohio State…

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.440
It was not an option, believe
me.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.420
[Laughs] …But it's going to
be a great feeling just to know

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.210
that I'm going to join a network of people,
of, you know,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.240
hundreds of thousands of people,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.350
that have come through this horseshoe before
me grabbing their diploma,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.320
and that if I ever fall on tough times in
life,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.590
I have a whole network of people that I can
lean my head on,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.430
and they'll be there to support me.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.410
Fantastic.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.200
So Adam, what was it like for you to come
here to the Ohio State University,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620
with your dad being presidency over the alumni
association,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.900
at one served as associate director of athletics.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.840
What was that like for you? How do you feel
you handled that?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.290
You know, I think I handled it
pretty well,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.500
for the most part, throughout college.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.280
I like to keep a low profile,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.490
so I wouldn't say that I was going around
gloating and telling people,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.200
"Yeah, that's my dad over there."

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.550
So, really the only time that anybody really
mentioned it was at football,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.940
just because they happened to know who you
were, and the history of that,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.590
and they knew that you were the president
of the alumni association.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.580
You know, every now and then a professor might
say something,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.600
that they noticed my name on the class list.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.530
But, you know, I kind of noticed that you
were a big deal a little bit

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.290
before I got to Ohio State, probably around,
you know, 8, 9 years old,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.120
when I started playing football.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.600
And even back then, little kids would talk
trash to me on the field,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.440
saying 'You're not your dad' or something.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.280
[Laughs] Well I tell you what,
you represented yourself extremely well.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.110
And I don't think I've ever said this to you,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.490
and your mom probably won't like me saying
this to you,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.080
but one of the things that I'm proud of,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.830
I know when you played football some of your
teammates called you 'Little Arch,'

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.319
and I've never told you this,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:54.169
but it made me proud that you never told them
to not call you 'Little Arch.'

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.330
Now your mom wasn't crazy about that,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.390
but you never told them that they couldn't
call you 'Little Arch.'

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.159
&gt;&gt;ADAM: Yeah.

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.610
And I can remember when some
of the players were over to the house,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.580
and they kept saying, 'Arch, Arch,' and I
thought they were talking to me,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.379
and yet they were talking to you.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:15.210
But I made me proud to know that you seemed
to be proud that they called you 'Little Arch.'

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.659
&gt;&gt;ADAM: Oh yeah, I was. The name kind
of stuck.

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.319
Christian Bryant gave it to me the first day
that we ever got here,

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.120
and then the next thing you know, everybody
called me that.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.380
Oh, well thank you for handling
that.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.980
