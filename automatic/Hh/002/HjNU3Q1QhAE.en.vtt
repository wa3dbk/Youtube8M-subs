it is you Thank You Sigma and agent
Texas<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.420> course<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.380> goes<00:00:28.529> without<00:00:28.650> saying

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
Texas of course that goes without saying

Texas of course that goes without saying
right<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:30.269> noticed<00:00:30.689> she<00:00:30.929> doesn't<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
right I noticed she doesn't have to

right I noticed she doesn't have to
attend<00:00:32.009> class<00:00:32.369> agent<00:00:32.969> Texas<00:00:33.239> doesn't<00:00:33.870> need

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
attend class agent Texas doesn't need

attend class agent Texas doesn't need
this<00:00:34.290> training<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> director<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
this training what the director is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
this training what the director is
trying<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.760> say<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.239> agent<00:00:36.600> Texas<00:00:36.780> has

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
trying to say is that agent Texas has

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
trying to say is that agent Texas has
already<00:00:37.649> completed<00:00:38.250> her<00:00:38.579> AI<00:00:38.790> Theory

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
already completed her AI Theory

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
already completed her AI Theory
coursework<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.219> think<00:00:41.219> that's<00:00:41.430> enough<00:00:41.820> for

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
coursework I think that's enough for

oh come on the different levels of AI

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.729 
oh come on the different levels of AI

possible<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.530> find<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.100> interesting

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

something<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> magnitude<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.600> be
