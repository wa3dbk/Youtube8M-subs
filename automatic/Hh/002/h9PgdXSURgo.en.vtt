know<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.079> can<00:02:13.260> buy<00:02:13.349> them<00:02:13.469> in<00:02:13.530> packs<00:02:13.799> of<00:02:13.920> three

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
know you can buy them in packs of three

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.059 
know you can buy them in packs of three
packs<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.730> five<00:02:14.999> packs<00:02:15.389> of<00:02:15.569> whatever<00:02:16.499> and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
packs of five packs of whatever and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.589 
packs of five packs of whatever and
as<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.400> say<00:02:17.549> sometimes<00:02:17.790> they're<00:02:18.120> cheaper<00:02:18.420> then

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
as I say sometimes they're cheaper then

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.770 
as I say sometimes they're cheaper then
but<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.370> really<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.939> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.239> try<00:02:21.599> when<00:02:21.749> I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
but but really if you can try when I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.030 
but but really if you can try when I
first<00:02:22.170> before<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.620> buy<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
first before you buy it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.259 
first before you buy it
especially<00:02:23.579> if<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:23.790> buying<00:02:23.939> from<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
especially if you're buying from a

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.750 
especially if you're buying from a
specific<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.799> looking<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.159> specific

specific if you're looking at a specific

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.809 
specific if you're looking at a specific
brand<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.299> because<00:02:27.959> really<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.889> time<00:02:29.609> that

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
brand one because really that time that

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.440 
brand one because really that time that
you've<00:02:29.969> spent<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:31.079> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.349> get<00:02:31.469> paid<00:02:31.680> back

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
you've spent it's going to get paid back

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.699 
you've spent it's going to get paid back
okay<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.260> grenade<00:02:34.739> launchers<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:36.650> now<00:02:37.650> we

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
okay so grenade launchers that now we

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.379 
okay so grenade launchers that now we
talked<00:02:38.040> about<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.400> talked<00:02:39.090> about<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
talked about the talked about the

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.440 
talked about the talked about the
grenades<00:02:39.719> now<00:02:40.139> how<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:40.829> these<00:02:40.950> useful<00:02:41.450> now

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
grenades now how are these useful now

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.959 
grenades now how are these useful now
the<00:02:43.379> usefulness<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:44.069> these<00:02:44.189> really<00:02:44.549> depends

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
the usefulness of these really depends

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.270 
the usefulness of these really depends
on<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:45.209> site<00:02:45.450> because<00:02:46.169> some<00:02:46.590> sites<00:02:46.859> will<00:02:47.069> say

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
on your site because some sites will say

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.640 
on your site because some sites will say
rebounds<00:02:47.939> count<00:02:48.239> other<00:02:48.780> sites<00:02:49.139> will<00:02:49.290> save<00:02:49.500> me

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
rebounds count other sites will save me

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.069 
rebounds count other sites will save me
bands<00:02:49.859> don't<00:02:50.159> count<00:02:50.519> now<00:02:51.419> what<00:02:51.659> I<00:02:51.689> mean<00:02:51.900> by<00:02:52.049> a

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
bands don't count now what I mean by a

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.530 
bands don't count now what I mean by a
rebound<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.099> BB<00:02:53.609> that's<00:02:53.760> hit<00:02:54.000> something<00:02:54.389> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
rebound is a BB that's hit something and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.439 
rebound is a BB that's hit something and
banks<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:55.019> off<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:56.219> part<00:02:56.699> of<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.969> idea<00:02:57.269> of

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
banks back off now part of the idea of

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.030 
banks back off now part of the idea of
these<00:02:57.629> is<00:02:57.840> when<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.169> fire<00:02:58.379> them<00:02:58.560> into<00:02:58.829> say<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
these is when you fire them into say a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.339 
these is when you fire them into say a
room<00:02:59.340> or<00:02:59.669> building<00:02:59.879> they<00:03:00.719> bounce<00:03:00.959> off<00:03:01.139> the

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
room or building they bounce off the

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.170 
room or building they bounce off the
walls<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.829> spray<00:03:02.280> everywhere<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:03.060> they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
walls they spray everywhere and they

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.569 
walls they spray everywhere and they
cause<00:03:03.419> a<00:03:03.449> lot<00:03:03.719> of<00:03:03.870> lot<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.560> bb's<00:03:04.949> traveling<00:03:05.489> all

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
cause a lot of lot of bb's traveling all

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.830 
cause a lot of lot of bb's traveling all
over<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.790> place<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.299> makes<00:03:06.419> it<00:03:06.540> very<00:03:06.659> very

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
over the place and it makes it very very

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
over the place and it makes it very very
difficult<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.379> avoid<00:03:07.680> them<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.849> if<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.299> site

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
difficult to avoid them but if the site

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.839 
difficult to avoid them but if the site
says<00:03:09.719> rebounds<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.409> count<00:03:10.709> then<00:03:11.159> it

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
says rebounds don't count then it

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.399 
says rebounds don't count then it
becomes<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.299> bit<00:03:12.449> difficult<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.900> call<00:03:13.199> whether

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
becomes a bit difficult to call whether

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.740 
becomes a bit difficult to call whether
or<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:13.709> you've<00:03:13.889> hit<00:03:14.040> someone<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.750> someone

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
or not you've hit someone and someone

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170 
or not you've hit someone and someone
who<00:03:15.959> has<00:03:16.109> been<00:03:16.139> hit<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:17.189> easily<00:03:17.639> say<00:03:17.849> well<00:03:18.090> it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
who has been hit can easily say well it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.399 
who has been hit can easily say well it
bounced<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.629> wall<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.139> they<00:03:19.230> all

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
bounced off the wall and they all

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.199 
bounced off the wall and they all
bounced<00:03:19.799> back<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.159> they<00:03:20.519> don't<00:03:20.730> count

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
bounced back so they don't count

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.719 
bounced back so they don't count
but<00:03:22.049> sites<00:03:22.349> which<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.650> lady<00:03:22.859> bangles<00:03:23.489> which

but sites which are lady bangles which

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.939 
but sites which are lady bangles which
the<00:03:24.030> majority<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.689> them<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.109> because<00:03:25.829> they're

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
the majority of them do because they're

the majority of them do because they're

as shrapnel it still counts these make a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
big difference to room clearing they're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.289 
big difference to room clearing they're
really<00:03:34.049> good<00:03:34.229> for<00:03:34.379> room<00:03:34.590> clearing<00:03:35.000> however<00:03:36.000> if

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
really good for room clearing however if

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.869 
really good for room clearing however if
you're<00:03:36.959> firing<00:03:37.169> direct<00:03:37.620> fire<00:03:38.509> ie

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.640 

straight<00:03:44.879> up<00:03:45.120> firing<00:03:45.870> directly<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.290> someone

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
straight up firing directly at someone

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.199 
straight up firing directly at someone
we've<00:03:46.829> been<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:47.099> directing<00:03:47.579> your<00:03:47.669> firing<00:03:48.060> over

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
we've been in directing your firing over

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.860 
we've been in directing your firing over
with<00:03:48.449> sandbags<00:03:48.659> or<00:03:49.049> whatever<00:03:50.629> not<00:03:51.629> brilliant

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
with sandbags or whatever not brilliant

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.539 
with sandbags or whatever not brilliant
because<00:03:52.379> quite<00:03:52.620> often<00:03:52.799> they<00:03:53.009> just<00:03:53.040> they're

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
because quite often they just they're

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.339 
because quite often they just they're
essentially<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.359> big<00:03:54.540> shotgun<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.139> just

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
essentially just a big shotgun you just

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.979 
essentially just a big shotgun you just
go<00:03:55.439> poof<00:03:55.799> do<00:03:56.790> any<00:03:56.939> H<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.299> front<00:03:57.509> of<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:57.750> and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
go poof do any H in front of you and

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.749 
go poof do any H in front of you and
then<00:03:58.229> that's<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> last<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.979> hear<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.459> and

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
then that's the last you hear of it and

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.670 
then that's the last you hear of it and
the<00:04:00.449> problem<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.900> especially<00:04:01.139> when<00:04:01.439> you<00:04:01.500> first

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
the problem is especially when you first

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.300 
the problem is especially when you first
get<00:04:01.949> them<00:04:03.079> it's<00:04:04.079> very<00:04:04.290> tempting<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.979> want<00:04:05.219> to

okay<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:55.280> grenade<00:04:56.280> launchers<00:04:56.640> come<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:56.910> lots

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
okay so grenade launchers come in lots

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.910 
okay so grenade launchers come in lots
of<00:04:57.150> different<00:04:57.210> types<00:04:57.720> now<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.800> is<00:04:58.890> a

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
of different types now this one is a

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.880 
of different types now this one is a
classic<00:04:59.100> army<00:04:59.520> long<00:04:59.820> one<00:05:00.500> they<00:05:01.500> also<00:05:01.650> do<00:05:01.860> a

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
classic army long one they also do a

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.080 
classic army long one they also do a
classic<00:05:02.220> army<00:05:02.370> short<00:05:02.670> one<00:05:02.790> which<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.060> think

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
classic army short one which I think

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.680 
classic army short one which I think
comes<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.630> about<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:05.520> kind<00:05:05.880> of<00:05:06.030> length<00:05:06.210> or<00:05:06.480> so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
comes to about that kind of length or so

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.020 
comes to about that kind of length or so
but<00:05:07.470> this<00:05:07.800> one's<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.100> right<00:05:08.490> for<00:05:08.640> this<00:05:08.790> gun

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
but this one's just right for this gun

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.510 
but this one's just right for this gun
so<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:10.140> wire<00:05:10.350> like<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.770> one<00:05:10.980> some<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.430> them

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
so this wire like this one some of them

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.250 
so this wire like this one some of them
a<00:05:11.550> bit<00:05:11.640> longer<00:05:12.000> some<00:05:12.390> of<00:05:12.450> them<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> bit<00:05:12.780> shorter

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
a bit longer some of them a bit shorter

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.200 
a bit longer some of them a bit shorter
some<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.070> Mapple<00:05:14.400> ones<00:05:14.610> are<00:05:14.790> only<00:05:14.910> about

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
some of the Mapple ones are only about

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.730 
some of the Mapple ones are only about
that<00:05:15.420> kind<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:15.840> size<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.380> those<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.710> be

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
that kind of size and those can be

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.920 
that kind of size and those can be
really<00:05:16.980> cool<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.490> things<00:05:17.730> like<00:05:17.820> mp5s<00:05:18.540> and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
really cool on things like mp5s and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.040 
really cool on things like mp5s and
various<00:05:19.770> other<00:05:19.950> weapons<00:05:20.340> like<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.870> but<00:05:21.870> you

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
various other weapons like that but you

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.510 
various other weapons like that but you
could<00:05:22.170> also<00:05:22.350> go<00:05:22.590> for<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.830> much<00:05:22.980> bigger<00:05:23.190> ones

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
could also go for the much bigger ones

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.540 
could also go for the much bigger ones
you<00:05:23.700> can<00:05:23.880> go<00:05:24.030> for<00:05:24.530> this<00:05:25.530> kind<00:05:25.890> of<00:05:25.980> thing<00:05:26.220> or<00:05:26.430> you

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
you can go for this kind of thing or you

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.150 
you can go for this kind of thing or you
can<00:05:26.700> go<00:05:26.880> for<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.350> law<00:05:28.350> rocket<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:28.920> once<00:05:29.070> you

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
can go for the law rocket so once you

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.140 
can go for the law rocket so once you
pull<00:05:29.370> out<00:05:29.400> or<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:30.860> 84<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.980> 84<00:05:32.580> rockets<00:05:33.000> I

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
pull out or the 84 the 84 rockets I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.450 
pull out or the 84 the 84 rockets I
believe<00:05:33.420> that<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.930> big<00:05:34.160> anti-tank<00:05:35.160> ones<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
believe that the big anti-tank ones the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.970 
believe that the big anti-tank ones the
US<00:05:35.730> are<00:05:35.880> using<00:05:36.150> at<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.300> moment<00:05:36.630> but<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:37.740> point

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
US are using at the moment but the point

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.170 
US are using at the moment but the point
is<00:05:38.100> there's<00:05:38.310> lots<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.730> different<00:05:39.060> options

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
is there's lots of different options

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.950 
is there's lots of different options
available<00:05:39.450> but<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:41.400> majority<00:05:41.670> of<00:05:41.940> them<00:05:42.180> still

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
available but the majority of them still

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.380 
available but the majority of them still
fall<00:05:43.260> back<00:05:43.410> on<00:05:43.620> your<00:05:43.740> shell<00:05:43.980> so<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:45.060> doesn't

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
fall back on your shell so it doesn't

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.540 
fall back on your shell so it doesn't
matter<00:05:45.740> what<00:05:46.740> you're<00:05:46.920> using<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.340> doesn't

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
matter what you're using it doesn't

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
matter whether it whether you're using

matter whether it whether you're using
an<00:05:48.930> underbarrel<00:05:49.380> grenade<00:05:49.530> launcher<00:05:50.340> or

an underbarrel grenade launcher or

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.030 
an underbarrel grenade launcher or

shoulder-mounted rocket launcher it

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.610 
shoulder-mounted rocket launcher it
really<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.770> comes<00:05:55.920> down<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.620> quite

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
really it comes down to this but quite

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.090 
really it comes down to this but quite
often<00:05:59.960> these<00:06:00.960> are<00:06:01.020> far<00:06:01.350> easier<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.710> reload

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
often these are far easier to reload

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.350 
often these are far easier to reload
because<00:06:02.220> all<00:06:02.400> you've<00:06:02.520> got<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.700> do<00:06:02.790> is<00:06:02.940> open<00:06:03.120> it

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
because all you've got to do is open it

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.600 
because all you've got to do is open it
get<00:06:03.570> new<00:06:03.810> one<00:06:03.960> em<00:06:04.110> close<00:06:04.650> it<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.100> you're<00:06:05.490> back

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
get new one em close it and you're back

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.270 
get new one em close it and you're back
in<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.850> game<00:06:06.290> but<00:06:07.290> really<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.920> comes<00:06:07.980> down<00:06:08.160> to

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
in the game but really it comes down to

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.490 
in the game but really it comes down to
personal<00:06:08.490> preference<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:09.480> also<00:06:10.050> depends

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
personal preference it also depends

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.100 
personal preference it also depends
whether<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.740> going<00:06:10.980> for<00:06:11.130> a<00:06:11.160> particular<00:06:11.430> look

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
whether you going for a particular look

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.400 
whether you going for a particular look
because<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.290> whole<00:06:13.440> reason<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.900> made<00:06:15.900> this<00:06:16.110> was

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
because the whole reason I made this was

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.170 
because the whole reason I made this was
because<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:17.310> goes<00:06:17.490> with<00:06:17.640> my<00:06:17.730> Spetsnaz<00:06:18.180> kit<00:06:18.450> so

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
because it goes with my Spetsnaz kit so

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.750 
because it goes with my Spetsnaz kit so
just<00:06:21.180> works<00:06:21.420> well<00:06:21.950> but<00:06:22.950> and<00:06:23.220> it's<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.550> right

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
just works well but and it's the right

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.910 
just works well but and it's the right
gun<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.090> have<00:06:24.270> for<00:06:24.450> that<00:06:24.480> for<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.530> kind<00:06:25.590> of

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
gun to have for that for that kind of

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920 
gun to have for that for that kind of
style<00:06:26.100> but<00:06:26.460> in<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.330> end<00:06:27.420> the<00:06:27.540> day<00:06:27.690> these<00:06:27.870> are

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
style but in the end the day these are

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.250 
style but in the end the day these are
expensive<00:06:29.690> they're<00:06:30.690> very<00:06:30.930> expensive

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
expensive they're very expensive

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.020 
expensive they're very expensive
