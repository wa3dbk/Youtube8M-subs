00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
and it's pretty fun I like that as well

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.270 
and it's pretty fun I like that as well
but<00:01:57.509> I'd<00:01:57.659> say<00:01:57.810> conquest<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> by<00:01:58.740> far<00:01:58.979> my

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
but I'd say conquest is by far my

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
but I'd say conquest is by far my
favorite<00:01:59.700> I've<00:02:00.030> been<00:02:00.149> playing<00:02:00.390> quite<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> bit

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
favorite I've been playing quite a bit

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.600

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that sniping I think it's easier than

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460 
that sniping I think it's easier than
the<00:02:06.940> other<00:02:07.210> battlefields<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:08.320> have

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
the other battlefields that have

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:18.960 
the other battlefields that have
actually<00:02:10.350> kill<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.470> guy<00:02:13.020> no<00:02:14.820> got<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:17.970> miss

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
actually kill that guy no got you miss

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.600 
actually kill that guy no got you miss
that<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:21.760> him<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:24.040> these<00:02:24.190> guys<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.520> like

sitting ducks yeah I like Battlefield 4
sniping<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.790> better<00:02:28.000> battlefield<00:02:28.690> 3<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
sniping the better battlefield 3 but the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.730 
sniping the better battlefield 3 but the
one<00:02:31.060> thing<00:02:31.270> about<00:02:31.390> sniping<00:02:31.690> if<00:02:32.080> people<00:02:32.620> are

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
one thing about sniping if people are

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.570 
one thing about sniping if people are
running<00:02:33.420> horizontally<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> fairly<00:02:36.280> long

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
running horizontally at a fairly long

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.070 
running horizontally at a fairly long
distance<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.780> are<00:02:38.080> um<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:40.990> example

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
distance and you are um just for example

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.960 
distance and you are um just for example
let's<00:02:42.090> get<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.239> or<00:02:44.170> should<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.380> go<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.830> kind<00:02:45.820> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
let's get in or should I go I kind of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.979 
let's get in or should I go I kind of
over<00:02:46.239> here<00:02:46.450> there's<00:02:46.810> more<00:02:46.989> action<00:02:47.110> over<00:02:47.350> here

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
over here there's more action over here

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.240 
over here there's more action over here
yeah<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.170> they're<00:02:50.380> running<00:02:50.590> horizontally<00:02:50.830> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
yeah so they're running horizontally and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.220 
yeah so they're running horizontally and
you're<00:02:51.370> kind<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.610> far<00:02:51.790> away<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.420> you're

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
you're kind of far away and you're

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530 
you're kind of far away and you're
sniping<00:02:53.440> trust<00:02:54.190> me<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.880> will<00:02:55.000> not<00:02:55.180> hit<00:02:55.360> them

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
sniping trust me you will not hit them

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.590 
sniping trust me you will not hit them
trying<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.620> predict<00:02:57.070> your<00:02:57.790> bullet<00:02:58.360> drop

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
trying to predict your bullet drop

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.720 
trying to predict your bullet drop
compared<00:02:59.500> with<00:02:59.620> their<00:02:59.860> speed<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> running

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
compared with their speed of the running

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.060 
compared with their speed of the running
is<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.989> hard<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.860> hit<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
is so so hard but if you do hit that

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.970 
is so so hard but if you do hit that
shot<00:03:03.430> oh<00:03:03.760> man<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.900> ever<00:03:05.140> rewarding<00:03:05.800> that's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
shot oh man is it ever rewarding that's
