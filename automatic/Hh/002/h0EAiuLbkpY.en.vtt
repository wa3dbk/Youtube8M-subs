and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> find<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.509> easy<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and you can find them pretty easy on the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.219 
and you can find them pretty easy on the
edges<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.189> sometimes<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> can't<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.390> it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
edges but sometimes you can't and it's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
where all the bases are and I'm just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.479 
where all the bases are and I'm just
going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.540> run<00:02:06.960> pass<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> code<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
going to run pass the code see if I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to run pass the code see if I
recognize<00:02:08.849> anything<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:10.560> there

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
recognize anything and then go there

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.010

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
going to jump in the water it's really

going to jump in the water it's really
my<00:02:39.270> eyes<00:02:39.390> man<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.110> still<00:02:40.290> bit<00:02:40.500> laggy<00:02:40.800> though

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
my eyes man it's still bit laggy though

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.820 
my eyes man it's still bit laggy though
and<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> actually<00:02:42.270> see<00:02:42.660> my<00:02:42.840> reflection

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and you can actually see my reflection

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.070 
and you can actually see my reflection
in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> water<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.940> crazy<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:45.990> is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
in the water that's crazy so this is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.950 
in the water that's crazy so this is
just<00:02:46.380> over<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.760> someone<00:02:48.360> already<00:02:48.720> looted

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
just over you and someone already looted

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.570 
just over you and someone already looted
that<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.680> means<00:02:49.890> there's<00:02:50.130> someone<00:02:50.370> in

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
that so that means there's someone in

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.670 
that so that means there's someone in
this<00:02:50.730> area<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:51.780> about<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.440> just

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
this area what about that is that just

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.700 
this area what about that is that just
no<00:02:52.830> that's<00:02:53.070> useful<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:54.170> nothing<00:02:55.170> spawning<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
no that's useful or nothing spawning it

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.000 
no that's useful or nothing spawning it
or<00:02:55.830> someone<00:02:56.130> already<00:02:56.790> looted<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.240> that's<00:02:57.420> also

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
or someone already looted it that's also

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.880 
or someone already looted it that's also
a<00:02:59.010> profit<00:02:59.880> uh<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.450> also<00:03:00.600> possible<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.350> I

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
a profit uh that's also possible so I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.260 
a profit uh that's also possible so I
don't<00:03:02.040> want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> get<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> text<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> water

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
don't want to get a text in the water

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.690 
don't want to get a text in the water
because<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.690> don't<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.590> let's<00:03:05.490> see

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
because I don't like that and let's see

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.640 
because I don't like that and let's see
I'm<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.270> head<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.750> way<00:03:06.930> hope<00:03:07.530> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
I'm just going to head that way hope I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.470 
I'm just going to head that way hope I
can<00:03:07.860> find<00:03:08.070> anything<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.700> I'll<00:03:08.790> probably<00:03:09.030> look

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
can find anything and I'll probably look

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.810 
can find anything and I'll probably look
for<00:03:09.660> some<00:03:09.840> more<00:03:10.020> Hunger<00:03:10.350> Game<00:03:10.500> Servers<00:03:10.950> then

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
for some more Hunger Game Servers then

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.990 
for some more Hunger Game Servers then
instead<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.420> playing<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.920> server<00:03:14.820> all

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
instead of playing on this server all

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.660 
instead of playing on this server all
the<00:03:15.210> time<00:03:15.420> cuz<00:03:15.780> it'll<00:03:16.350> bore<00:03:16.860> off<00:03:17.220> their<00:03:17.520> Bay

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the time cuz it'll bore off their Bay

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.940 
the time cuz it'll bore off their Bay
and<00:03:17.910> maybe<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.600> get<00:03:18.750> some<00:03:18.959> crazy<00:03:19.590> custom

care<00:05:06.630> if<00:05:06.720> it's<00:05:06.870> glitchy<00:05:07.170> as<00:05:07.410> long<00:05:07.590> as<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.860> looks

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
care if it's glitchy as long as it looks

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.650 
care if it's glitchy as long as it looks
really<00:05:08.430> nice<00:05:08.580> because<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.120> looks<00:05:09.360> just

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
really nice because this looks just

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.900 
really nice because this looks just
amazingly<00:05:10.290> keep<00:05:11.010> my<00:05:11.130> thinking<00:05:11.490> there's<00:05:11.670> a<00:05:11.760> guy

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
amazingly keep my thinking there's a guy

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.460 
amazingly keep my thinking there's a guy
behind<00:05:12.210> me<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:12.720> this<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> bridge<00:05:13.350> for

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
behind me so this is a bridge for

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.930 
behind me so this is a bridge for
example<00:05:13.530> that's<00:05:14.130> what<00:05:14.310> they<00:05:14.430> built<00:05:14.640> is<00:05:14.820> there

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
example that's what they built is there

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.570 
example that's what they built is there
anything<00:05:15.150> underneath<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.720> bridges<00:05:15.930> um<00:05:16.860> let's

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
anything underneath the bridges um let's

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.600 
anything underneath the bridges um let's
see<00:05:17.820> nothing<00:05:18.450> nothing<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.140> think<00:05:19.380> I<00:05:19.590> think<00:05:20.370> I

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
see nothing nothing I think I think I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.370 
see nothing nothing I think I think I
don't<00:05:20.820> know<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.270> don't<00:05:22.050> know

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
don't know I don't know

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.830 
don't know I don't know
so<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.680> actually<00:05:23.010> know<00:05:23.430> where<00:05:23.700> I'm<00:05:23.820> at<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.480> can<00:05:24.660> I

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
so I actually know where I'm at it can I

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.980 
so I actually know where I'm at it can I
think<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.200> can<00:05:25.230> hit<00:05:25.560> these<00:05:25.710> enemies<00:05:26.190> over<00:05:26.460> here

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
think I can hit these enemies over here

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.570 
think I can hit these enemies over here
yes<00:05:27.990> that's<00:05:28.230> actually<00:05:28.440> not<00:05:29.010> against<00:05:29.430> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
yes that's actually not against the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.000 
yes that's actually not against the
rules<00:05:29.610> because<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.420> can't<00:05:30.630> hit<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:31.010> grass

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
rules because you can't hit the grass

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.820 
rules because you can't hit the grass
for<00:05:32.280> example<00:05:32.420> the<00:05:33.420> floors<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.960> think<00:05:34.200> or<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
for example the floors I think or it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.340 
for example the floors I think or it
gets<00:05:34.950> replenished<00:05:35.490> after<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.060> while<00:05:36.270> um<00:05:36.630> it's

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
gets replenished after a while um it's

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.350 
gets replenished after a while um it's
gonna<00:05:37.470> run<00:05:37.710> over<00:05:37.950> here<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.400> maybe<00:05:38.580> go<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.060> that

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
gonna run over here it maybe go to that

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.290 
gonna run over here it maybe go to that
island<00:05:39.870> see<00:05:40.590> if<00:05:40.650> there's<00:05:40.860> some<00:05:41.730> chests<00:05:42.060> over

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
island see if there's some chests over

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.020 
island see if there's some chests over
here<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:43.650> hope<00:05:43.890> let's<00:05:44.400> hope<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.670> can<00:05:44.850> find
