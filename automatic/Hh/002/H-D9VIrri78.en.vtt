out tool launcher the energy ring

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.219 
out tool launcher the energy ring
see-through<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.770> cool

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:35.090 

lightning<00:01:26.750> spin<00:01:27.750> track<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:33.740> let's<00:01:34.740> put<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
lightning spin track and let's put it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:46.489 
lightning spin track and let's put it
thing<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.759> stuff<00:01:38.759> off

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:51.029 

this<00:01:47.499> might<00:01:47.829> be<00:01:49.560> challenging<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.799> some

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
this might be challenging for some

00:01:51.039 --> 00:02:07.390 
this might be challenging for some
people<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.719> challenging<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.289> me

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:28.500 

Oh

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:38.470 

most<00:02:31.299> almost<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.819> just<00:02:38.030> taking

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
most almost like so I just taking

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:54.770 
most almost like so I just taking
someone

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.490 

yes<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:56.740> right<00:02:57.690> okay<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.020> just<00:03:00.120> take<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.270> out

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
yes all right okay and just take it out

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.410 
yes all right okay and just take it out
and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.710> we'll<00:03:03.070> assemble<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:04.230> take<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and then we'll assemble it take the the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.200 
and then we'll assemble it take the the
spin<00:03:08.200> track<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:11.370> put<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.490> energy<00:03:12.700> ring<00:03:13.060> on

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
spin track on put the energy ring on

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.490 
spin track on put the energy ring on
either<00:03:13.540> way<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.320> way<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:15.010> has<00:03:15.160> two<00:03:15.400> different

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
either way this way it has two different

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.270 
either way this way it has two different
forms<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.860> way<00:03:18.070> or<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.850> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.690> part

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
forms this way or you can see that part

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.840 
forms this way or you can see that part
and<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.400> turn<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:23.070> 90<00:03:24.070> degrees<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.670> then

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
and then turn it 90 degrees and then

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.140 
and then turn it 90 degrees and then
cover<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.780> part<00:03:26.080> instead<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.820> has<00:03:27.910> two

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
cover that part instead so it has two

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.000 
cover that part instead so it has two
different<00:03:28.540> modes<00:03:30.210> just<00:03:31.210> take<00:03:31.770> baseball<00:03:32.770> put

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
different modes just take baseball put

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.690 
different modes just take baseball put
it<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.130> top<00:03:33.690> take<00:03:34.690> your<00:03:34.930> tool<00:03:36.750> screw<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.930> on

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
it on top take your tool screw it on

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:50.160 
it on top take your tool screw it on
take<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.690> fast<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.860> there<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.010> go
