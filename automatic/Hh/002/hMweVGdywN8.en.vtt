some brake that's there but don't see
any<00:03:34.879> leaking<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.690> wheel<00:03:36.079> cylinder<00:03:37.209> as<00:03:38.209> you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
any leaking in the wheel cylinder as you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.149 
any leaking in the wheel cylinder as you
can<00:03:38.599> see<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:40.450> drum<00:03:41.450> looks<00:03:41.870> really<00:03:42.379> good<00:03:42.590> and

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
can see the drum looks really good and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.849 
can see the drum looks really good and
it's<00:03:43.599> warm<00:03:44.599> very<00:03:44.870> well<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.349> brakes<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.709> one

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
it's warm very well the brakes of one

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.140 
it's warm very well the brakes of one
very<00:03:46.069> well<00:03:46.129> it's<00:03:47.030> obviously<00:03:47.540> within<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.349> last

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
very well it's obviously within the last

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
not too many miles ago there is braking

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.309 
job done on both the front and the back
on<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.500> truck<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> frame<00:03:55.220> back<00:03:55.489> here<00:03:56.319> is

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
on this truck of the frame back here is

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.149 
on this truck of the frame back here is
actually<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.959> good<00:04:00.079> shape<00:04:00.379> but<00:04:00.889> there<00:04:01.069> is

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
actually and in good shape but there is

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.000 
actually and in good shape but there is
a<00:04:01.190> problem<00:04:01.459> with<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> spring<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:03.859> can

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
a problem with the spring the you can

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.949 
a problem with the spring the you can
see<00:04:04.250> here<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:04.549> one<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> Leafs<00:04:05.299> has<00:04:05.659> come

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
see here that one of the Leafs has come

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.439 
see here that one of the Leafs has come
out<00:04:06.109> of<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:08.180> fact<00:04:08.419> that<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:10.359> bracket<00:04:11.359> is

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
out of the the fact that the bracket is

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.140 
out of the the fact that the bracket is
broke<00:04:11.870> well<00:04:12.400> maybe<00:04:13.400> that's<00:04:13.669> the<00:04:13.819> way<00:04:13.970> they're

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
broke well maybe that's the way they're

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.250 
broke well maybe that's the way they're
made<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.299> don't<00:04:14.480> know<00:04:14.780> I'm<00:04:14.900> not<00:04:14.989> real<00:04:15.169> familiar

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
made I don't know I'm not real familiar

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.900 
made I don't know I'm not real familiar
with<00:04:15.530> these<00:04:15.739> tracks<00:04:16.130> but<00:04:17.019> as<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.169> can<00:04:18.289> see<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
with these tracks but as you can see the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.939 
with these tracks but as you can see the
spring<00:04:19.910> on<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.180> other<00:04:20.299> side<00:04:20.570> is<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.709> same

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
spring on the other side is is the same

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.730 
spring on the other side is is the same
way

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.770 

these<00:04:29.370> brackets<00:04:29.699> must<00:04:30.150> surely<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.449> broke

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
these brackets must surely be broke

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.570 
these brackets must surely be broke
because<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.410> ones<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.889> other<00:04:31.919> side<00:04:32.280> wrap

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
because the ones on the other side wrap

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.249 
because the ones on the other side wrap
around<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.180> can<00:04:33.330> see<00:04:33.449> evidence<00:04:33.720> in<00:04:34.139> this

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
around and you can see evidence in this

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.490 
around and you can see evidence in this
top<00:04:34.530> leaf<00:04:34.860> or<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.539> bracket<00:04:36.539> at<00:04:36.690> one<00:04:36.870> time<00:04:37.169> came

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500

all<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.740> way<00:04:37.770> around<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.430> summer<00:04:38.669> long

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
all the way around so summer long

spring link on the board the adjuster is

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.159 
spring link on the board the adjuster is
falling<00:05:30.879> out<00:05:30.999> and<00:05:31.449> part<00:05:32.379> of<00:05:32.499> it<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:34.360> appears

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
falling out and part of it this appears

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.170 
falling out and part of it this appears
to<00:05:35.259> be<00:05:35.349> missing<00:05:35.919> so<00:05:36.219> that's<00:05:36.430> definitely<00:05:36.759> going

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
to be missing so that's definitely going

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.999 
to be missing so that's definitely going
to<00:05:37.449> be<00:05:37.569> a<00:05:37.599> problem<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.289> the<00:05:38.439> brakes<00:05:38.710> that's

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
to be a problem with the brakes that's

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.640 
to be a problem with the brakes that's
going<00:05:39.189> to<00:05:39.279> have<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.900> be<00:05:40.900> dealt<00:05:41.169> with<00:05:41.289> this

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650

adjuster<00:05:42.219> should<00:05:42.430> slide<00:05:42.699> in<00:05:42.939> here<00:05:43.740> in<00:05:44.740> some

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
adjuster should slide in here in some

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.129 
adjuster should slide in here in some
such<00:05:45.279> manner<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:47.819> spring<00:05:48.840> hold<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.050> all

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
such manner and spring hold it all

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.369 
such manner and spring hold it all
together<00:05:50.349> but<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.759> can<00:05:51.969> see<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:52.479> it's<00:05:53.110> gone

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
so I don't know what's happened there

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.589 
so I don't know what's happened there
but<00:05:59.729> there<00:06:00.729> it's<00:06:00.969> just<00:06:01.060> not<00:06:01.300> in<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.479> right

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
but there it's just not in the right

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:02.010 
but there it's just not in the right
place

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
place

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
long enough you can get to go back in

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.640 
long enough you can get to go back in
with<00:06:14.319> a<00:06:14.800> bit<00:06:15.009> kind<00:06:15.189> of<00:06:15.310> a<00:06:15.400> paint<00:06:15.669> so<00:06:16.620> we're<00:06:17.620> just

going to get it take for a drive down
the<00:06:19.389> road<00:06:19.509> hopefully<00:06:19.960> it's<00:06:20.949> really<00:06:21.189> hard<00:06:21.370> to

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
the road hopefully it's really hard to

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.010 
the road hopefully it's really hard to
do<00:06:21.520> on<00:06:21.669> video<00:06:21.999> but<00:06:22.180> maybe<00:06:22.330> we<00:06:22.509> get<00:06:22.599> a<00:06:22.659> feel<00:06:22.870> for

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
do on video but maybe we get a feel for

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.339 
do on video but maybe we get a feel for
the<00:06:23.110> track<00:06:23.259> and<00:06:23.529> how<00:06:23.650> it<00:06:23.710> runs<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:25.229> cuz<00:06:26.229> you're

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
the track and how it runs and cuz you're

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.619 
the track and how it runs and cuz you're
gonna<00:06:26.409> see<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:26.889> find<00:06:27.069> out<00:06:27.250> here<00:06:27.490> in<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.580> minute

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
gonna see and find out here in a minute

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:30.779 
gonna see and find out here in a minute
these<00:06:28.629> two<00:06:29.259> point<00:06:29.560> two<00:06:29.770> seasons<00:06:30.339> are<00:06:30.490> just<00:06:30.669> at

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
these two point two seasons are just at

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.079 
these two point two seasons are just at
aureus<00:06:31.300> but<00:06:31.539> I'm<00:06:31.659> having<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:32.439> lot<00:06:32.919> of<00:06:32.979> power<00:06:33.310> so

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:34.089 
aureus but I'm having a lot of power so
