00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.569 
start out with the smaller CCPs torso
there<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> use<00:00:43.579> these

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
there so just that and then I use these

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.500 
there so just that and then I use these
bone<00:00:44.940> pieces<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.620> arm<00:00:46.829> pieces<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.610> then

bone pieces here for arm pieces and then

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340 
bone pieces here for arm pieces and then
for<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> legs<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.039> slightly<00:00:50.730> longer

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
for the legs I use the slightly longer

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.670 
for the legs I use the slightly longer
ones<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> extra<00:00:53.460> pinhole<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
ones with the extra pinhole in them and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
ones with the extra pinhole in them and
to<00:00:55.680> attach<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.160> shoulders<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.940> use<00:00:57.420> these

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to attach the shoulders I use these

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
to attach the shoulders I use these
pieces<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:59.010> now<00:00:59.579> I've<00:00:59.640> said<00:00:59.820> before<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> use

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pieces here now I've said before I use

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
pieces here now I've said before I use
the<00:01:00.809> shoulder<00:01:01.079> build<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> protector

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the shoulder build like in the protector

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.479 
the shoulder build like in the protector
of<00:01:02.430> Earth<00:01:02.899> build<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
of Earth build so that's what I use to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.510 
of Earth build so that's what I use to
make<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:06.659> I've<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.900> these

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
make them on and then I've got these

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.710 
make them on and then I've got these
this<00:01:08.520> piece<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.000> hopefully<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> can

this piece right here hopefully you can
see<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:12.049> use<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.470> extend<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
see that I use that to extend the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
see that I use that to extend the
shoulders<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.729> hold<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.150> second<00:01:18.540> I'm

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
shoulders so hold on just a second I'm

and just put them together and then put
these<00:01:52.109> blue<00:01:52.409> pins<00:01:52.829> through<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:54.409> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> can

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
these blue pins through them if you can

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.469 
these blue pins through them if you can
see<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.039> Lighting's<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.819> bad<00:01:56.969> where<00:01:57.390> I'm

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

see that Lighting's really bad where I'm
at<00:01:57.599> right<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.780> yeah<00:01:58.439> once<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.099> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
at right now yeah once I put them in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.319 
at right now yeah once I put them in
there<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.319> then<00:02:01.319> I<00:02:01.349> take<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> piece

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
there like that then I take this piece

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
there like that then I take this piece
here<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.130> just<00:02:05.130> attach<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:07.069> doesn't<00:02:08.069> matter

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
here and just attach it doesn't matter

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.759 
here and just attach it doesn't matter
which<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.549> attach<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.470> attach<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> like

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
which way you attach it attach it like

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:23.110 
which way you attach it attach it like
that<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:12.239> next<00:02:12.599> comes<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> actual<00:02:13.160> shoulders

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.330 

so<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.629> small<00:02:25.410> axle<00:02:25.829> pieces<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
so you take the small axle pieces and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.630 
so you take the small axle pieces and
put<00:02:26.459> them<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.829> then<00:02:28.829> you

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
put them in there like that and then you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.080 
put them in there like that and then you
put<00:02:29.879> these<00:02:30.060> shoulder<00:02:30.420> pieces<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:31.579> like<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:32.879> I

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
put these shoulder pieces on like so I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
put these shoulder pieces on like so I
mean<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:33.510> pretty<00:02:33.750> much<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
mean it's pretty much like the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.580 
mean it's pretty much like the
protective<00:02:35.040> earth<00:02:35.280> shoulder<00:02:35.879> build<00:02:36.290> but<00:02:37.290> then

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590

just attach them like so and that is the
torso<00:02:58.620> build<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.510> these<00:03:00.720> pieces<00:03:00.989> are<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.319> to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
torso build so these pieces are going to

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.069 
torso build so these pieces are going to
be<00:03:01.440> used<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.980> connect<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.310> arms<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.930> is

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.350 
can't look at it anyway but then I
attach<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:26.200> bottom<00:04:26.800> piece<00:04:27.160> here<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:28.090> top

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.760 
attach the bottom piece here to the top
hole<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:31.930> one<00:04:32.229> hole<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.530> kind<00:04:32.740> of

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
hole like so so that one hole is kind of

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.140 
hole like so so that one hole is kind of
exposed<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.840> then<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> attach<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.700 
torso when using this ball piece right
there<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.760> comes<00:04:39.940> on<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:41.169> also<00:04:41.500> line

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
there that comes on it but I also line

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.600 
there that comes on it but I also line
up<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:42.070> pin<00:04:42.400> that's<00:04:43.210> right<00:04:43.600> I<00:04:44.430> don't<00:04:45.430> know<00:04:45.550> if

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
up that pin that's right I don't know if

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.219 
up that pin that's right I don't know if
you<00:04:45.700> can<00:04:45.820> see<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.390> lights<00:04:46.600> real<00:04:46.750> bad<00:04:46.930> at

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
you can see it in the lights real bad at

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.100 
you can see it in the lights real bad at
that<00:04:47.380> top<00:04:47.680> right<00:04:47.919> there<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:49.030> attach<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.660> to

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that top right there and I attach it to

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.810 
that top right there and I attach it to
this<00:04:50.979> piece<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:52.590> once<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.710> get<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.950> all<00:04:54.039> lined<00:04:54.280> up

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
this piece so once I get it all lined up

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.810 
this piece so once I get it all lined up
and<00:04:55.120> popped<00:04:55.539> on<00:04:55.720> there<00:04:56.460> then<00:04:57.460> it's<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:57.669> going

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
and popped on there then it's not going

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.340 
and popped on there then it's not going
to<00:04:57.910> move<00:04:58.060> around<00:04:58.210> but<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.840> is<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:58.990> slightly

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
to move around but this is a slightly

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.370 
to move around but this is a slightly
shorter<00:04:59.470> piece<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.910> doesn't<00:05:01.240> prohibit<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
shorter piece so it doesn't prohibit the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.460 
shorter piece so it doesn't prohibit the
leg<00:05:02.740> articulation<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.660> let's<00:05:04.990> keep<00:05:05.140> going<00:05:05.200> and

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
leg articulation so let's keep going and

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.620 
leg articulation so let's keep going and
see<00:05:05.650> where<00:05:05.800> we<00:05:05.890> go<00:05:05.919> with<00:05:06.100> this<00:05:06.190> guy<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:07.060> here<00:05:07.510> we

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
see where we go with this guy so here we

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.600 
see where we go with this guy so here we
have<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.169> some<00:05:08.530> basic<00:05:09.100> armor<00:05:09.430> that

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
have is just some basic armor that

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.520 
have is just some basic armor that
thrown<00:05:09.910> on<00:05:10.030> I've<00:05:10.270> chosen<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.690> go<00:05:10.720> with<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:11.050> dark

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
thrown on I've chosen to go with a dark

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.920 
thrown on I've chosen to go with a dark
gunmetal<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.370> light<00:05:12.580> green<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.150> then

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
gunmetal and the light green and then

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.020 
gunmetal and the light green and then
you<00:05:14.110> can<00:05:14.260> rotate<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.800> around<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.550> see<00:05:15.820> the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
you can rotate it around and see the

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.640 
you can rotate it around and see the
armor<00:05:16.330> piece<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.720> attached<00:05:17.080> on<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.410> back

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
armor piece that I attached on the back

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.680 
armor piece that I attached on the back
I<00:05:17.979> decided<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.610> use<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.940> big<00:05:19.150> paw<00:05:19.419> piece

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
I decided to use the big paw piece

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.469 
I decided to use the big paw piece
instead<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.850> another<00:05:21.850> piece<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.180> armor<00:05:22.450> but

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
instead of another piece of armor but

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.450 
instead of another piece of armor but
you<00:05:22.690> can<00:05:22.840> use<00:05:23.050> any<00:05:23.380> type<00:05:23.590> of<00:05:23.620> armor<00:05:24.039> that<00:05:24.160> fits

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
you can use any type of armor that fits

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.820 
you can use any type of armor that fits
and<00:05:24.640> it<00:05:24.760> doesn't<00:05:24.970> prohibit<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:26.200> articulation

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
and it doesn't prohibit the articulation

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.460 
and it doesn't prohibit the articulation
of<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:26.979> shoulders<00:05:27.430> at<00:05:28.060> all<00:05:28.539> so<00:05:29.140> this<00:05:29.229> next

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
of the shoulders at all so this next

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.070 
of the shoulders at all so this next
step<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.100> like<00:05:30.910> to<00:05:31.270> extend<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.950> neck<00:05:33.190> up<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.669> bit

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
step I like to extend the neck up a bit

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.510 
step I like to extend the neck up a bit
with<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.200> protectors<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:36.240> use<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:38.250> one<00:05:39.250> of

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
with the protectors I use just one of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.580 
with the protectors I use just one of
these<00:05:39.669> friction<00:05:40.030> pieces<00:05:40.390> and<00:05:41.140> then<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.500> attach

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
these friction pieces and then I attach

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.740 
these friction pieces and then I attach
it<00:05:41.800> here<00:05:42.930> on<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.500> neck<00:05:44.680> joint<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:46.419> just

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
it here on the neck joint and that just

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.540 
it here on the neck joint and that just
extends<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.500> head<00:05:47.680> out<00:05:47.830> and<00:05:48.159> doesn't<00:05:48.490> get

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
extends the head out and doesn't get

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.780 
extends the head out and doesn't get
blocked<00:05:48.789> by<00:05:48.940> this

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
blocked by this

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.790 
blocked by this
but<00:05:49.910> with<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.270> brain<00:05:50.810> attack<00:05:50.960> heads<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:51.650> have

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
but with the brain attack heads you have

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.400 
but with the brain attack heads you have
to<00:05:51.950> use<00:05:52.220> an<00:05:52.490> extra<00:05:52.820> piece<00:05:53.090> or<00:05:53.900> at<00:05:54.050> least<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.350> do

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
to use an extra piece or at least I do

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.680 
to use an extra piece or at least I do
just<00:05:55.040> so<00:05:55.160> it<00:05:55.250> looks<00:05:55.430> a<00:05:55.520> little<00:05:55.580> better<00:05:55.850> so<00:05:56.570> when

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
just so it looks a little better so when

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.010 
just so it looks a little better so when
you<00:05:56.780> snap<00:05:57.020> that<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.230> there<00:05:58.210> like<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.540> then<00:05:59.900> it

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
you snap that on there like so then it

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.980 
you snap that on there like so then it
extends<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:00.590> neck<00:06:00.770> a<00:06:00.800> little<00:06:01.130> bit<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:02.720> that

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
extends the neck a little bit and that

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.570 
extends the neck a little bit and that
way<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.290> can<00:06:03.440> get<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:03.680> know<00:06:03.740> full<00:06:04.130> range<00:06:04.430> of

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
way it can get you know full range of

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.220 
way it can get you know full range of
motion<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.180> doesn't<00:06:05.450> look<00:06:05.600> completely

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
motion and it doesn't look completely

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.280 
motion and it doesn't look completely
weird<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.490> there<00:06:07.940> we<00:06:08.060> go<00:06:08.090> I've<00:06:08.510> just<00:06:08.900> completed

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290
