00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 review stone cold Steve Austin is supposed to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 supposedly from the wwe for food 31 for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.990
 an appearance had been asked 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.330
 but he allegedly refused 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 Water at least in a podcast said 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 he does not appear at wrestlemania 31 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 place and the show from home 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.080
 Track why this is so is the wwe 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 official even undecided 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 However , that shows just for very 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.800
 a lot of commotion backstage and many questions 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.710
 why not become with wrestlemania 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 31 was supposed to occur supposedly one should 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 even a ready program for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 the sausage had meaning that he was at 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.559
 Wrestlemania should complete 31 but 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.719
 stone cold Steve Austin has now 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.030
 officially decided whether he 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.309
 next year at the wrestlemania in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 Texas will have another appearance 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.030
 is still questionable, however 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.600
 many assume that this is the case 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 will be 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.859
 also the rocker for wrestlemania 31 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 be planned and this has the wwe 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.780
 No cancellation he said that he 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 maybe complete an appearance 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.689
 But being told a fan in one 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 interview 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 I would say you should that wwe 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 network look 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 that could be a little teaser on one 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.729
 occurs from drogba 31 be that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.490
 Of course it is still questionable 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.970
 but many assume the opposite 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 age will be on sunday at wrestlemania 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.560
 31.1 of the biggest matches of the year 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
 to become with wrestlemania and it became 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 now confirmed that sting and triple 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.939
 agent performance center in orlando 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.460
 today shortly before your departure to 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.710
 California is still intense on her 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 should have worked in the match 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.149
 since both are of the opinion that one 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 should be really good match 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.159
 the undertaker and sting are by the way 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.159
 for the issue to wrestlemania 31 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.259
 booked so for the direct show after 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.060
 Wrestlemania that does not mean that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
 now both in one segment 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.869
 stand against each other but it was yes 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.060
 already rumored that the undertaker 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.069
 and maybe a match 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.439
 Wrestlemania 32 can have 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.969
 and that could also be initiated here 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.519
 if that happens is unclear 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:17.340
 However, sure that is 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.129
 undertaker and sting both backstage 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.409
 the roma press will be present 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:26.459
 tv occurs but as I said not 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:28.889
 sure in dalaran smi sane and kevin us 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.750
 are all four for the next tv shows 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.810
 after wrestlemania and that even for 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.269
 booked several weeks whether you in the tv 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.530
 also wants to use or only in dark 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.389
 matches is still unclear 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.489
 but up to the injury 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.530
 kevin at us and serve a 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.329
 important point where you have to say 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.199
 the two will probably not 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.150
 avenge match 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.699
 the last issue was in the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.400
 Venue of Lucia underground 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.709
 So los angeles and very many 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.079
 lucia underground pomace were also on 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.439
 Last monday at monday night raw 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.209
 There was also a poster in the hall 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.180
 in the audience resp 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.689
 there should be but lucio underground 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.479
 posters and posters of rest in 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.819
 peace perron aguayo junior were from 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.489
 the security at robbe sleep evening 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.250
 the wwe does not want this tragedy 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.040
 pay attention to it and keep it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.840
 at the tweets of triple agent stefanie 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.389
 Maeck one, however, you do not want 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.659
 pay attention to this show again 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.659
