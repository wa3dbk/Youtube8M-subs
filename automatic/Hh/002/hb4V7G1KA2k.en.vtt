with the RM series radios the Jason is
going<00:00:12.810> to<00:00:12.900> show<00:00:13.020> you<00:00:13.080> how<00:00:13.260> this<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.560> be

going to show you how this can be

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.860 
going to show you how this can be
accomplished<00:00:14.130> absolutely<00:00:14.850> so<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.720> very

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
accomplished absolutely so it's a very

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
accomplished absolutely so it's a very
simple<00:00:16.320> process<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:17.269> after<00:00:18.269> you've

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
simple process of after you've

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.790 
simple process of after you've
customized<00:00:18.990> your<00:00:19.080> radio<00:00:19.470> you're<00:00:19.620> going<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
customized your radio you're going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
customized your radio you're going to
want<00:00:19.950> to<00:00:20.039> clone<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.030> that<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> rest<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
want to clone so that the rest of the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.870 
want to clone so that the rest of the
radio<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.870> in<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:22.110> fleet<00:00:22.289> match<00:00:22.820> if<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
radio is in your fleet match if you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.550 
radio is in your fleet match if you
didn't<00:00:24.300> make<00:00:24.420> changes<00:00:24.780> to<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.020> radio<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
didn't make changes to this radio and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.990 
didn't make changes to this radio and
customize<00:00:26.100> it<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.820> no

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
customize it and then really be no

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.130 
customize it and then really be no
reason<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> clone<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.750> radio<00:00:27.990> because

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
reason to clone the radio because

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.029 
reason to clone the radio because
they're<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.350> going<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.530> talk<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.010> another

out of box on default frequencies but

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
out of box on default frequencies but
for<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> purpose<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.820> test<00:00:33.059> I've

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
for the purpose of this test I've

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.979 
for the purpose of this test I've
programmed<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.559> radio<00:00:34.859> to<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.989> something

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
programmed this radio to have something

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
programmed this radio to have something
other<00:00:37.079> than<00:00:37.290> default<00:00:37.500> frequencies<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.820> I'm

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
other than default frequencies so I'm

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
other than default frequencies so I'm

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.170 
notice that this is not plugged in we
don't<00:01:31.830> need<00:01:32.070> power<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.610> order<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> clone

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
don't need power in order to clone

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.660 
don't need power in order to clone
because<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.229> acts<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> bridge<00:01:35.009> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
because this just acts as a bridge so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
because this just acts as a bridge so
we're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.689> pockets<00:01:37.110> or

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we're going to use these two pockets or

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
we're going to use these two pockets or
these<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.619> pockets<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> clone<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
these two pockets to clone and it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.830 
these two pockets to clone and it
doesn't<00:01:38.909> matter<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> front

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
doesn't matter if it goes on the front

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
doesn't matter if it goes on the front
or<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.590> terms<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> source<00:01:41.369> radio

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
or the back in terms of the source radio

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
or the back in terms of the source radio
just<00:01:42.180> needs<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
just needs to be in one or the other so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
just needs to be in one or the other so
I'm<00:01:43.830> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> place<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.600> I'm<00:01:45.750> going

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I'm going to place it here and I'm going

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.359 
I'm going to place it here and I'm going
to<00:01:45.900> take<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> new<00:01:46.500> radio<00:01:46.680> which<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> right

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to take this new radio which is right

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.170 
to take this new radio which is right
out<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> box<00:01:48.470> unprogrammed<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.180> actually

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
out of the box unprogrammed and actually

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.819 
out of the box unprogrammed and actually
you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.689> an<00:01:51.750> RM<00:01:51.990> new<00:01:52.079> 2080<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you can see it's an RM new 2080 so it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
you can see it's an RM new 2080 so it
doesn't<00:01:53.070> even<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.400> be<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> same<00:01:53.880> way<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
doesn't even need to be the same way so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.179 
doesn't even need to be the same way so
I'm<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.409> sure<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.680> turned<00:01:55.890> on

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I'm going to make sure it's turned on

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.679 
I'm going to make sure it's turned on
I'm<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> put<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:56.939> next<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
I'm going to put it right next to that

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
I'm going to put it right next to that
radio<00:01:58.079> again<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.700> either<00:01:59.939> pocket

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
radio again it can be in either pocket

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.210 
radio again it can be in either pocket
and<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.049> back<00:02:01.200> over<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
and I'm going to go right back over to

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.639 
and I'm going to go right back over to
the<00:02:02.369> source<00:02:02.640> radio<00:02:03.470> I'm<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.680> press<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> hold
