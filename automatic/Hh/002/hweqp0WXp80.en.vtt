an<00:00:08.990> auto<00:00:09.990> polyploid<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.010> an<00:00:11.160> individual<00:00:11.790> that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
an auto polyploid is an individual that

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.789 
an auto polyploid is an individual that

number of the diploid count to a
tetraploid<00:00:25.019> count<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.680> other<00:00:26.519> words<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
tetraploid count in other words this

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
tetraploid count in other words this
cell<00:00:27.570> doesn't<00:00:27.840> separate<00:00:28.410> its<00:00:28.590> chromosomes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
cell doesn't separate its chromosomes

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.790 
cell doesn't separate its chromosomes
during<00:00:29.580> meiosis<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> gametes<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
during meiosis and the gametes have the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
during meiosis and the gametes have the
same<00:00:35.100> number<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> chromosomes<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.750> parent

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
same number of chromosomes as the parent

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.280 
same number of chromosomes as the parent
cell<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.899> undergoes<00:00:40.500> meiosis<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
cell this all undergoes meiosis one and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
cell this all undergoes meiosis one and
doesn't<00:00:43.290> separate<00:00:44.280> its<00:00:44.460> chromosomes<00:00:45.030> right

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
doesn't separate its chromosomes right

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
doesn't separate its chromosomes right
so<00:00:46.200> only<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.710> gamete<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so only one gamete it's all of the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.290 
so only one gamete it's all of the
chromosomes<00:00:49.309> undergoes<00:00:50.309> meiosis<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
chromosomes undergoes meiosis two and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
chromosomes undergoes meiosis two and
the<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:51.870> happens<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:53.190> means<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the same thing happens which means that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.959 
the same thing happens which means that
this<00:00:54.989> gammy<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.309> same<00:00:56.579> number<00:00:56.940> of

this gammy has the same number of
