00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that's what this one looks like it's a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.580 
that's what this one looks like it's a
little<00:00:45.390> box<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.870> comes<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> brush

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
think the shape of this would actually

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
think the shape of this would actually
be<00:00:52.039> pretty<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.300> bronzer<00:00:54.989> you

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
you can so it's a extremely light color

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.280 
you can so it's a extremely light color
which<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> good<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.600> me<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.080> very

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
which is good for me because I have very

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.910 
which is good for me because I have very
fair<00:01:28.530> skin<00:01:28.590> um<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.659> doesn't<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
fair skin um so it doesn't take a lot to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
fair skin um so it doesn't take a lot to
blend<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.770> know

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
blend it out so it don't look you know

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.510 
blend it out so it don't look you know
like<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.640> dark<00:01:36.060> brown<00:01:36.930> line<00:01:37.520> if

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
like you have that dark brown line if

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.210 
like you have that dark brown line if
you<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:40.079> contour<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.710> all

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you use it to contour at all

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.649 
you use it to contour at all
so<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.670> why<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.509> does

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
so that's why I like it because it does

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
so that's why I like it because it does
not<00:01:42.689> take<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> blending<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
not take a lot of blending and you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
not take a lot of blending and you
pretty<00:01:45.509> much<00:01:45.630> place<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.649> looks

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
pretty much place it and it looks

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.270 
pretty much place it and it looks
extremely<00:01:47.700> natural<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.560> sure<00:01:49.799> how

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
extremely natural on me I'm not sure how

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.080 
extremely natural on me I'm not sure how
well<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> would<00:01:50.729> work<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:52.490> darker<00:01:53.490> skin<00:01:53.520> tones

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
well it would work for darker skin tones

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
well it would work for darker skin tones

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.820 
still use it here and there because it
is<00:03:53.440> such<00:03:53.740> a<00:03:53.770> pretty<00:03:54.130> pale<00:03:54.520> color<00:03:54.850> but<00:03:55.830> the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
is such a pretty pale color but the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.650 
is such a pretty pale color but the
color<00:03:57.070> palette<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.850> not<00:03:58.090> there<00:03:58.360> at<00:03:58.510> all

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
color palette is just not there at all

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.650 
color palette is just not there at all
so<00:03:58.990> I<00:03:59.610> haven't<00:04:00.610> given<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:00.970> on<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:01.450> I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
so I haven't given up on it because I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.390 
so I haven't given up on it because I
really<00:04:01.990> want<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.350> like<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.770> because<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.370> a

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
really want to like it because it is a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.060 
really want to like it because it is a
pretty<00:04:03.700> color<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.390> like<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.260> said<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.620> it

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
pretty color but like I said it just it

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.270 
pretty color but like I said it just it
doesn't<00:04:06.490> show<00:04:06.910> enough<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.770> I'm<00:04:09.040> almost

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
doesn't show enough so I'm almost

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.979 
doesn't show enough so I'm almost
tempted<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.880> give<00:04:10.150> this<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.480> my<00:04:10.600> daughter<00:04:10.870> I

although I know if you can really see it
in<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.660> lighting<00:05:03.050> in<00:05:03.199> here<00:05:03.229> but<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.729> a

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
in the lighting in here but this is a

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.120 
in the lighting in here but this is a
very<00:05:05.979> coral<00:05:06.979> peachy<00:05:08.020> color<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.680> does<00:05:09.889> have

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
very coral peachy color and it does have

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.760 
very coral peachy color and it does have
a<00:05:10.160> slight<00:05:10.850> bit<00:05:11.419> of<00:05:12.400> Sheen<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.729> so<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:15.470> looks

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
a slight bit of Sheen to it so it looks

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.060 
a slight bit of Sheen to it so it looks
fairly<00:05:16.370> matte<00:05:16.910> on<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.870> swatch<00:05:18.410> but<00:05:18.800> when<00:05:18.979> you

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
fairly matte on this swatch but when you

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.070 
fairly matte on this swatch but when you
actually<00:05:19.280> put<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.850> on<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.120> can<00:05:20.389> see<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.780> little

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
actually put it on you can see a little

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.640 
actually put it on you can see a little
bit<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.620> like<00:05:22.100> a<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.990> almost<00:05:24.169> looks<00:05:24.470> like<00:05:24.530> a

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650
