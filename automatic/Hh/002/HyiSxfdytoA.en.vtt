a few exceptions and she wants to
understand<00:04:41.970> why<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:43.110> she<00:04:43.170> taps<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.830> dot

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
understand why so she taps on the dot

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.610 
understand why so she taps on the dot
and<00:04:44.310> she<00:04:45.090> gets<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.540> idea<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.440> the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
sick it's a below her reading of 65 but

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.220 
sick it's a below her reading of 65 but
she<00:04:50.190> wants<00:04:50.430> more<00:04:50.610> information<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.840> she<00:04:51.900> taps

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
she wants more information so she taps

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.860 
she wants more information so she taps
on<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.590> again<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.130> she<00:04:53.970> gets<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.300> specifics

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
on it again and she gets the specifics

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.890 
on it again and she gets the specifics
of<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.080> reading<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.910> can<00:04:57.060> see<00:04:57.300> here<00:04:57.750> it

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
of that reading as you can see here it

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.050 
of that reading as you can see here it
was<00:04:58.320> before<00:04:58.500> swim<00:04:58.980> meet<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.370> maddie<00:04:59.850> was

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
was before swim meet and maddie was

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.420 
was before swim meet and maddie was
really<00:05:00.450> anxious<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.770> what<00:05:01.950> does<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.070> mean

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
really anxious so what does that mean

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.670 
really anxious so what does that mean
for<00:05:02.670> Maddie<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.510> means<00:05:03.750> all<00:05:03.960> she<00:05:04.200> has<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.380> do

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
for Maddie that means all she has to do

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770 
for Maddie that means all she has to do
is<00:05:04.950> next<00:05:05.490> time<00:05:05.640> lower<00:05:05.910> her<00:05:06.120> insulin<00:05:06.570> dose<00:05:06.750> a

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
is next time lower her insulin dose a

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.220 
is next time lower her insulin dose a
little<00:05:07.170> bit<00:05:07.440> more<00:05:07.710> than<00:05:08.370> she<00:05:08.580> did<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:09.510> when

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
little bit more than she did that when

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.640 
little bit more than she did that when
she<00:05:10.350> has<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> swim<00:05:11.040> practice<00:05:11.900> okay<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.590> she

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
she has a swim practice okay so she

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.700 
she has a swim practice okay so she
knows<00:05:13.920> exactly<00:05:14.130> what<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.700> do<00:05:14.970> as<00:05:15.290> you<00:05:16.290> can<00:05:16.440> see
