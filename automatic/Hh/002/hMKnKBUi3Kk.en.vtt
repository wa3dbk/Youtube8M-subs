00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
we've got you know your touch is a

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.200 
we've got you know your touch is a
delegate<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.250> your<00:00:23.460> application<00:00:23.910> delegate

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
delegate here your application delegate

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.570 
delegate here your application delegate
and<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.260> again<00:00:25.470> we've<00:00:25.650> got<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and you can see again we've got the the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370 
and you can see again we've got the the
UI<00:00:26.760> window<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> main<00:00:27.720> view<00:00:27.960> windows<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
UI window in the main view windows the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.640 
UI window in the main view windows the
same<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.710> before<00:00:29.929> again<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.080> come<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
same as before again we come in and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.340 
same as before again we come in and
we've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:32.009> our<00:00:32.160> window<00:00:32.520> set<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.170> we<00:00:34.170> come

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
we've got our window set up here we come

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.760 
we've got our window set up here we come
in<00:00:34.500> specifically<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:37.500> we're<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
in specifically here what we're going to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
in specifically here what we're going to
want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:40.460> go<00:00:41.460> ahead<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:44.690> basically<00:00:45.690> set

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
want to do is go ahead and basically set

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.660 
want to do is go ahead and basically set
it<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.739> thing<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> set<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it the same thing so we want to set up a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
it the same thing so we want to set up a
uiimageview<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.719> case<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.079> we'll<00:00:49.260> need

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
uiimageview in this case so we'll need

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
uiimageview in this case so we'll need
one<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.340> timer<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:51.079> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
one of them in and it's timer again and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.860 
one of them in and it's timer again and
what<00:00:52.770> we're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
what we're going to do here is go in and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.270 
what we're going to do here is go in and
see<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.820> specifically<00:00:57.800> we<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> have

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
see what specifically we want to have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
see what specifically we want to have
done<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> let's<00:01:00.000> run<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:02.570> program<00:01:03.570> real

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
done and let's run this program real

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.030 
done and let's run this program real
quick<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
quick and you can see we're going to do

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.690 
quick and you can see we're going to do
basically<00:01:05.700> we've<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> quick<00:01:07.049> animation<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
basically we've got a quick animation of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
basically we've got a quick animation of
the<00:01:08.760> rotating<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.920> cylinder<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the rotating of a of a cylinder so it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.370 
the rotating of a of a cylinder so it's
pretty<00:01:12.180> simple<00:01:12.479> basically<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> click

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
pretty simple basically when you click

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.010 
pretty simple basically when you click
on<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.850> responds<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.180> head<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
on it responds and it goes head and it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.760 
on it responds and it goes head and it
runs<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.500> animation<00:01:16.830> where<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.189> rotates<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
runs an animation where it rotates and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.050 
runs an animation where it rotates and
coordination<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.460> us<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
coordination is good for us because it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
coordination is good for us because it
does<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> work<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:24.900> us<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.619> far<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
does a lot of the work for us as far as

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.280 
does a lot of the work for us as far as
stringing<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:28.229> images<00:01:28.770> together<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.290> if

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
stringing these images together so if

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
stringing these images together so if
you<00:01:31.439> come<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.549> look<00:01:32.700> under<00:01:32.909> our

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you come in here and you look under our

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
you come in here and you look under our
resources<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.720> our<00:01:33.780> images<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.680> see

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
resources of our images you can see

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
resources of our images you can see
we've<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.130> eight<00:01:35.689> specific<00:01:36.689> images<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we've got eight specific images that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
we've got eight specific images that
will<00:01:37.829> play<00:01:38.280> through<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:40.790> let's<00:01:41.790> go

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
will play through here and let's go

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
will play through here and let's go
ahead<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.299> how<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.649> again

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
ahead and see how we do that so again

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.050 
ahead and see how we do that so again
we're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> implement<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.520> main<00:01:44.790> view

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we're going to implement the main view

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
we're going to implement the main view
we're<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> synthesize<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.439> image<00:01:46.890> in

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
we're going to synthesize one image in

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
we're going to synthesize one image in
this<00:01:47.189> case<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> tick<00:01:47.700> view<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> holder

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
this case a tick view which is a holder

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
this case a tick view which is a holder
image<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.570> go<00:01:51.570> ahead<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.500> set<00:01:53.310> up

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
image and if we go ahead here and set up

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
image and if we go ahead here and set up
that<00:01:53.520> image<00:01:53.640> again<00:01:54.360> we've<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> uiimageview

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that image again we've got a uiimageview

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
that image again we've got a uiimageview
we're<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> call<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.040> image<00:01:56.399> view<00:01:56.640> one

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
we're going to call this image view one

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.920 
we're going to call this image view one
and<00:01:58.159> uiimageview<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.579> lock-in<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.570> frame

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and uiimageview a lock-in it with frame

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.410 
and uiimageview a lock-in it with frame
cgrectmake<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.250> again<00:02:02.579> we're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> set

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
cgrectmake and again we're going to set

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
cgrectmake and again we're going to set
its<00:02:03.540> location<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.320> its<00:02:04.530> size<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> first

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
its location and its size so the first

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
its location and its size so the first
two<00:02:06.299> parameters<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> location<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
two parameters are for the location the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.120 
two parameters are for the location the
second<00:02:08.160> tour<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.550> size

second tour for the size

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.570 
second tour for the size
and<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:09.880> got<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.150> image<00:02:10.390> v1<00:02:10.810> image<00:02:11.590> equals

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and we got that image v1 image equals

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.730 
and we got that image v1 image equals

three four five six seven and eight and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.970 
three four five six seven and eight and
basically<00:03:39.820> or<00:03:40.270> induce<00:03:41.020> view<00:03:41.350> animation

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
basically or induce view animation

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.949 
basically or induce view animation
duration<00:03:42.640> equals<00:03:42.910> point<00:03:43.150> seven<00:03:43.420> five<00:03:43.450> so

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
you'd like view one that start animating

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.160 
you'd like view one that start animating
basically<00:04:06.970> we<00:04:07.030> will<00:04:07.150> add<00:04:07.300> animation<00:04:07.900> features

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
basically we will add animation features

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.890 
basically we will add animation features
witness<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.590> can<00:04:08.740> see<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.160> self<00:04:09.400> dot<00:04:09.580> add

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
witness you can see it so self dot add

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.540 
witness you can see it so self dot add
sub<00:04:10.900> view<00:04:11.110> one<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.590> then<00:04:11.770> we<00:04:11.980> want<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.280> release

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
sub view one and then we want to release

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.110 
sub view one and then we want to release
that<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:12.940> it'll<00:04:13.180> run<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.570> be<00:04:13.780> warned<00:04:14.020> release

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
that so it'll run so be warned release

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.630 
that so it'll run so be warned release
and<00:04:16.830> basically<00:04:17.830> what<00:04:17.979> that<00:04:18.040> will<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.430> it

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
and basically what that will do is it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.070 
and basically what that will do is it
will<00:04:18.669> run<00:04:18.910> through<00:04:19.120> once<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.630> then<00:04:19.780> what

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
will run through once and then what

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.290 
will run through once and then what
we're<00:04:20.229> going<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.410> want<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.650> do<00:04:20.770> is<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.669> we<00:04:22.030> were

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
we're going to want to do is if we were

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.800 
we're going to want to do is if we were
to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.370 
to
to<00:04:22.870> not<00:04:23.530> run<00:04:23.889> this<00:04:24.130> animation<00:04:25.030> timer<00:04:25.480> here<00:04:25.840> so

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
to not run this animation timer here so

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.740 
to not run this animation timer here so
let's<00:04:26.770> go<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.250> when<00:04:27.370> we<00:04:27.490> run<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.750> this

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
let's go and do it when we run this this

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.310 
let's go and do it when we run this this
timer<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:30.120> if<00:04:31.120> we<00:04:31.270> run<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.570> through<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.930> cycles

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
timer and if we run it through it cycles

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.750 
timer and if we run it through it cycles
through<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.919> we<00:04:33.550> were<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:34.650> take<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.889> this

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
through if we were to take this this

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:46.950 
through if we were to take this this
timer<00:04:37.060> out<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:42.780> let's<00:04:43.780> go<00:04:43.990> ahead<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:45.960> remove

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
timer out and let's go ahead and remove

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.610 
timer out and let's go ahead and remove
this<00:04:47.350> timer<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.550> doesn't<00:04:51.090> factor<00:04:52.090> in

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
this timer so that it doesn't factor in

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.850 
this timer so that it doesn't factor in
if<00:04:53.620> we<00:04:53.800> were<00:04:53.889> go<00:04:54.010> ahead<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.310> do<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.490> and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
if we were go ahead and do that and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.280 
if we were go ahead and do that and
we'll<00:04:56.860> save<00:04:57.160> that<00:05:00.570> what<00:05:01.570> we<00:05:01.720> would<00:05:01.870> see<00:05:02.139> is

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
we'll save that what we would see is

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:19.910 
we'll save that what we would see is
that

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.890 

is<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:20.820> would<00:05:20.940> get<00:05:21.090> jumpy<00:05:21.510> when<00:05:21.660> we

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
is that it would get jumpy when we

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900 
is that it would get jumpy when we
clicked<00:05:22.170> on<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.530> see<00:05:22.770> how<00:05:22.860> we<00:05:22.980> can<00:05:23.160> we<00:05:23.760> can

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
clicked on it and see how we can we can

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.380 
clicked on it and see how we can we can
double<00:05:24.270> click<00:05:24.300> on<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:25.020> icon<00:05:25.920> however<00:05:26.370> if<00:05:27.120> we

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
double click on the icon however if we

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.580 
double click on the icon however if we
go<00:05:27.570> ahead<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:29.390> set<00:05:30.390> that<00:05:30.420> timer<00:05:30.840> up<00:05:31.110> there

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:42.310 

what<00:05:34.590> we<00:05:34.770> do

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.650 

as<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.010> can't<00:05:43.250> multiple<00:05:43.670> click<00:05:43.880> on<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.210> it

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
as you can't multiple click on it it

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.630 
as you can't multiple click on it it
basically<00:05:44.810> locks<00:05:45.500> it<00:05:45.710> out<00:05:45.860> so<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.190> it's<00:05:46.430> not

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
basically locks it out so that it's not

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.700 
basically locks it out so that it's not
being<00:05:46.970> interacted<00:05:47.660> with<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:47.990> if<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.500> notice

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
being interacted with and if you notice

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.900 
being interacted with and if you notice
the<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:50.750> timer<00:05:51.050> here<00:05:51.440> is<00:05:54.370> set<00:05:55.370> so<00:05:55.610> that<00:05:55.640> it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
the the timer here is set so that it

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.980 
the the timer here is set so that it
inactivates<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:58.460> object<00:05:59.210> on<00:05:59.360> touch<00:05:59.660> and

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
inactivates the the object on touch and

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.130 
inactivates the the object on touch and
then<00:06:01.090> brings<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.270> tick<00:06:02.450> of<00:06:02.480> you<00:06:02.690> back<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:03.110> the

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
then brings the tick of you back to the

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.390 
then brings the tick of you back to the
front<00:06:04.540> so<00:06:05.710> basically<00:06:06.710> what<00:06:06.830> we're<00:06:06.950> doing<00:06:06.980> is

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
front so basically what we're doing is

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.760 
front so basically what we're doing is
we're<00:06:08.030> we're<00:06:08.600> sending<00:06:09.170> the<00:06:09.260> tick<00:06:09.410> you<00:06:09.590> to<00:06:09.650> the

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
we're we're sending the tick you to the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.140 
we're we're sending the tick you to the
back<00:06:09.950> and<00:06:09.980> then<00:06:10.370> bringing<00:06:10.610> it<00:06:10.760> back<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:11.060> the

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
back and then bringing it back to the

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.090 
back and then bringing it back to the
front<00:06:11.420> so<00:06:11.630> it<00:06:11.780> can<00:06:11.930> be<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:12.710> it<00:06:12.830> can<00:06:12.980> be

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
front so it can be so it can be

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.210 
front so it can be so it can be
activated<00:06:13.550> in<00:06:13.880> dealt<00:06:14.480> with<00:06:14.660> and<00:06:15.070> that's<00:06:16.070> how

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
activated in dealt with and that's how

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.710 
activated in dealt with and that's how
you<00:06:16.280> get<00:06:16.550> your<00:06:16.780> animation<00:06:17.780> loop<00:06:22.480> so<00:06:23.480> that's

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
you get your animation loop so that's

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.840 
you get your animation loop so that's
the<00:06:24.140> basic<00:06:24.800> general<00:06:26.290> idea<00:06:27.290> behind<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:28.520> simple

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
the basic general idea behind the simple

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.880 
the basic general idea behind the simple
animation<00:06:29.360> here<00:06:29.660> and<00:06:29.840> you<00:06:30.380> can<00:06:30.530> go<00:06:30.680> ahead<00:06:30.800> and

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
animation here and you can go ahead and

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.070 
animation here and you can go ahead and
do<00:06:31.160> a<00:06:31.190> bunch<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:32.150> different<00:06:32.450> animations<00:06:32.930> in

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
do a bunch of different animations in

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.790 
do a bunch of different animations in
there<00:06:33.290> if<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.980> would<00:06:34.130> if<00:06:34.460> you<00:06:34.700> would<00:06:35.800> it's

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
there if you would if you would it's

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.870 
there if you would if you would it's
creative<00:06:37.100> as<00:06:37.190> you<00:06:37.220> can<00:06:37.490> get<00:06:37.700> so<00:06:39.730> there<00:06:40.730> you<00:06:40.760> go

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
creative as you can get so there you go

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.730 
creative as you can get so there you go
that's<00:06:41.120> basically<00:06:41.570> that<00:06:41.810> and<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:42.470> can<00:06:42.620> head

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
that's basically that and you can head

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.170 
that's basically that and you can head
to<00:06:42.830> the<00:06:42.860> website<00:06:43.100> and<00:06:44.500> download<00:06:45.500> these<00:06:45.710> and

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
to the website and download these and

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.690 
to the website and download these and
use<00:06:47.180> them<00:06:47.330> as<00:06:47.510> you<00:06:47.780> as<00:06:48.200> you<00:06:48.260> see<00:06:48.590> fit<00:06:48.770> and<00:06:49.040> if

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
use them as you as you see fit and if

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.950 
use them as you as you see fit and if
again<00:06:50.030> if<00:06:50.090> you<00:06:50.210> have<00:06:50.270> any<00:06:50.450> questions<00:06:50.840> or
