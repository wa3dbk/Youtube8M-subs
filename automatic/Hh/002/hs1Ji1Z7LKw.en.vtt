of<00:01:51.590> outlet<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.119> feel<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:55.880> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
of outlet I feel like it's like it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.789 
of outlet I feel like it's like it's
like<00:01:57.030> trying<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.450> pop<00:01:57.659> popcorn<00:01:57.960> kernels<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like trying to pop popcorn kernels you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
like trying to pop popcorn kernels you
know<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.969> nice<00:02:00.180> action<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
know if you do one nice action and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.649 
know if you do one nice action and
expect<00:02:01.320> immediate<00:02:01.799> positive<00:02:02.460> results<00:02:02.820> that's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
expect immediate positive results that's

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.450 
expect immediate positive results that's
like<00:02:03.840> putting<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.290> kernel<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> pan<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

expecting<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> pop<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.259> can't<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.680> make

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
expecting it to pop you can't just make

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
expecting it to pop you can't just make
that<00:02:08.220> pop<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.849> at<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> time<00:02:09.209> or<00:02:09.360> you'll<00:02:09.479> starve

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
to death but if you throw a whole bunch

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.979 
to death but if you throw a whole bunch
of<00:02:13.590> kernels<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.239> make<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> good

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
of kernels in if you do make the good

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.420 
of kernels in if you do make the good
choice<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.920> variety<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.310> different

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
situations you never know which kernels

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.490
