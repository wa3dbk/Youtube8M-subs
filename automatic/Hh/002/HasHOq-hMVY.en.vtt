in the pocket so this exercise um is
something<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.300> ten<00:00:24.539> minutes<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
something that you can do ten minutes a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.830 
something that you can do ten minutes a
day<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.310> week<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:26.880> more<00:00:27.269> whenever

day for really a week or more whenever

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
day for really a week or more whenever
it's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.260> great<00:00:28.470> warmup<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.160> also<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's a great warmup it's also just a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.999 
it's a great warmup it's also just a
great<00:00:29.849> thing<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> practice<00:00:30.529> what<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
great thing to practice what you do is

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.040 
great thing to practice what you do is
you<00:00:32.130> take<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.520> grid<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.329> eighth<00:00:33.510> notes<00:00:33.809> here

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
you take this grid of eighth notes here

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
you take this grid of eighth notes here
you'll<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> four<00:00:37.710> measures<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> eighth

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you'll see it's four measures of eighth

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
you'll see it's four measures of eighth
notes<00:00:38.670> eight<00:00:38.969> eighth<00:00:39.329> notes<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.809> each<00:00:39.930> measure

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
notes eight eighth notes in each measure

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
notes eight eighth notes in each measure
and<00:00:40.620> they're<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.700> rhythmic<00:00:42.329> notation

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and they're just in rhythmic notation

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
and they're just in rhythmic notation
meaning<00:00:43.140> no<00:00:43.440> notes

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
meaning no notes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600 
meaning no notes
just<00:00:44.390> just<00:00:45.390> rhythms<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
just just rhythms and what you do is you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.450 
just just rhythms and what you do is you
play<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.570> these<00:00:48.870> rhythms<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.590> ticka<00:00:50.309> ticka

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
play all these rhythms as ticka ticka

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.220 
play all these rhythms as ticka ticka
that's<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.030> guitar<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.780> play<00:00:54.989> each

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that's on guitar just like you play each

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
that's on guitar just like you play each
note<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
note that way and then what you do is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.220 
note that way and then what you do is
you<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.379> circle<00:00:58.980> a<00:01:00.079> few<00:01:01.079> eighth

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you go in and you circle a few eighth

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.869 
you go in and you circle a few eighth
notes<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.100> each<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> eighth

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
notes and then on each of the eighth

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
notes and then on each of the eighth
notes<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.420> you've<00:01:03.570> circled<00:01:03.870> instead<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
notes that you've circled instead of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.390 
notes that you've circled instead of
playing<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.979> ticka<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> play<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.990> chord<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.010> like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
playing a ticka you play a chord so like

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
playing a ticka you play a chord so like
for<00:01:08.640> example<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> circled<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> first

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
for example if you circled the first

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
for example if you circled the first
eighth<00:01:10.650> note<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.280> each<00:01:12.240> set<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> four<00:01:12.960> eighth

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
eighth note in each set of four eighth

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
eighth note in each set of four eighth
notes<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.979> each<00:01:14.010> bar<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.240> look<00:01:15.390> like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
notes for each bar which would look like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.140 
notes for each bar which would look like
this<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:17.340> would<00:01:17.549> sound<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.270> 2<00:01:19.200> 3<00:01:19.470> 4<00:01:19.860> 3<00:01:20.759> 4

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
this it would sound like this 2 3 4 3 4

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.249 
this it would sound like this 2 3 4 3 4
3<00:01:21.659> 4<00:01:22.700> I'm<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.060> playing<00:01:24.420> chords<00:01:24.900> where<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
3 4 I'm just playing chords where the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.429 
3 4 I'm just playing chords where the
circle<00:01:25.680> happens<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.090> muted<00:01:27.659> ticka

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
circle happens and then just muted ticka

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
circle happens and then just muted ticka
ticka<00:01:28.560> scratchy<00:01:29.159> daichi's<00:01:29.700> over<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:32.150> non

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
ticka scratchy daichi's over the non

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
ticka scratchy daichi's over the non
circled<00:01:33.780> ones<00:01:34.310> it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.610> simple

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
circled ones it's a really simple

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
circled ones it's a really simple
exercise<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.799> actually<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.280> pretty

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
exercise but it can actually be pretty

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
exercise but it can actually be pretty
tricky<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> play<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> rhythms<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
tricky to play some of the rhythms you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
tricky to play some of the rhythms you
end<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> couple

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
end up with so here are a couple

00:01:41.790 --> 00:02:27.210 
end up with so here are a couple
examples

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.970 

so<00:02:28.220> pick<00:02:28.490> one<00:02:28.760> rhythm<00:02:28.940> each<00:02:29.270> day<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
so pick one rhythm each day that is a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.900 
so pick one rhythm each day that is a
either<00:02:31.550> challenging<00:02:32.390> or<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:33.070> new<00:02:34.070> or<00:02:34.340> even

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
either challenging or just new or even

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.630 
either challenging or just new or even
if<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.240> old<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.810> focus<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.710> on<00:02:37.070> one<00:02:37.400> rhythm

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
if it's old just focus in on one rhythm

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.000 
if it's old just focus in on one rhythm
and<00:02:38.000> play<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.110> with<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.290> metronome<00:02:39.740> at

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and play it with the metronome at

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.830 
and play it with the metronome at
different<00:02:40.370> speeds<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> try<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.240> really<00:02:41.570> get

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
different speeds and try to really get

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
different speeds and try to really get
in<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.230> pocket<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:43.790> different

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
in the pocket it can be really different

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.960 
in the pocket it can be really different
to<00:02:44.480> play<00:02:44.630> these<00:02:44.900> rhythms<00:02:45.230> very<00:02:45.620> slow<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> very

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
to play these rhythms very slow and very

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.760 
to play these rhythms very slow and very
fast<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.780> middle<00:02:47.930> each<00:02:48.200> speed<00:02:49.040> region<00:02:49.880> is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
fast in the middle each speed region is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:06.980
