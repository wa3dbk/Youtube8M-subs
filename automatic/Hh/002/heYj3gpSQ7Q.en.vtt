00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
get a clear one this one is probably the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.050 
get a clear one this one is probably the
one<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.140> have<00:03:20.380> used<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.860> most<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.459> far<00:03:21.790> as

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
one that I have used the most so far as

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.010 
one that I have used the most so far as
you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.510> see<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:23.560> one<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:23.980> plum<00:03:24.490> one

you can see this one is the plum one
that's<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.260> color<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:28.090> has<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.660> most

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
that's the color I think it has the most

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.650 
that's the color I think it has the most
color<00:03:29.320> out<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.400> four<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.420> actually

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
color out of the four that I actually

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.210 
color out of the four that I actually
have<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:34.020> honey<00:03:35.730> which<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.890> more<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.190> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
have the honey which is a more of a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.620 
have the honey which is a more of a
natural<00:03:40.140> color<00:03:42.000> that's<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.209> honey<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:45.630> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
natural color that's the honey and the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.930 
natural color that's the honey and the
passion<00:03:47.350> which<00:03:47.860> is<00:03:48.040> one<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.520> newest<00:03:48.880> one

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.140 

and<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.570> definitely<00:03:56.140> more<00:03:56.440> more<00:03:56.920> pink<00:03:57.370> so

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
and it's definitely more more pink so

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.080 
and it's definitely more more pink so
the<00:03:58.420> rose<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:59.200> the<00:04:00.040> honey<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:01.140> more<00:04:03.090> neutral

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
the rose in the honey is more neutral

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.810 
the rose in the honey is more neutral
and<00:04:04.330> then<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.630> passion<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:06.130> plum<00:04:06.459> is

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
and then the passion and the plum is

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.420 
and then the passion and the plum is
more<00:04:07.360> pigmented<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:09.880> pretty<00:04:10.450> sure<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.750> they

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
more pigmented I'm pretty sure that they

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.469 
I know a lot of people have review about
this<00:05:38.990> product<00:05:39.260> on<00:05:39.590> YouTube<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:41.180> they<00:05:41.300> say

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
this product on YouTube that they say

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.690 
this product on YouTube that they say
they<00:05:41.630> don't<00:05:41.750> like<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.919> failure<00:05:43.220> and

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
stuff like that I just think that

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.000 
stuff like that I just think that
they're<00:05:45.860> expecting<00:05:47.169> something<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.410> this<00:05:48.950> is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
they're expecting something that this is

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.040 
they're expecting something that this is
not<00:05:49.789> the<00:05:50.150> product<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:50.750> they<00:05:50.930> actually

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
not the product that they actually

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.580 
not the product that they actually
expecting<00:05:51.860> like<00:05:52.160> they<00:05:52.400> want<00:05:52.729> a<00:05:52.940> lips<00:05:53.240> take<00:05:53.590> out

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
expecting like they want a lips take out

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.170 
expecting like they want a lips take out
of<00:05:54.770> this<00:05:55.010> lip<00:05:55.220> balm<00:05:55.430> but<00:05:55.640> this<00:05:55.850> is<00:05:55.970> not<00:05:56.150> a

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
of this lip balm but this is not a

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.390 
of this lip balm but this is not a
lipstick<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.810> is<00:05:56.960> a<00:05:56.990> tinted<00:05:57.440> lip<00:05:57.500> balm<00:05:57.890> so<00:05:57.919> if

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
lipstick this is a tinted lip balm so if

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.930 
lipstick this is a tinted lip balm so if
it<00:05:58.550> doesn't<00:05:58.940> have<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.090> color<00:05:59.419> payoff<00:05:59.720> um

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
it doesn't have a color payoff um

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.340 
it doesn't have a color payoff um
because<00:06:01.940> this<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.300> a<00:06:02.330> tinted<00:06:02.720> lip<00:06:02.930> balm<00:06:03.110> it's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
because this is a tinted lip balm it's

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.930 
because this is a tinted lip balm it's
not<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.560> lipstick<00:06:04.870> but<00:06:05.870> I'll<00:06:06.080> show<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.940> the

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
not a lipstick but I'll show you the

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.740 
not a lipstick but I'll show you the
color<00:06:08.710> that's<00:06:09.710> this<00:06:10.130> one<00:06:10.460> this<00:06:11.150> one<00:06:11.330> is<00:06:11.360> number

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
color that's this one this one is number

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.150 
color that's this one this one is number
four<00:06:12.140> one<00:06:12.410> eight<00:06:12.620> in<00:06:12.919> caring<00:06:13.400> coral<00:06:13.960> as<00:06:14.960> far<00:06:15.919> as

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
four one eight in caring coral as far as

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.500 
four one eight in caring coral as far as
the<00:06:16.430> feel<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.570> think<00:06:18.410> it's<00:06:18.700> very<00:06:19.700> similar<00:06:20.210> to

the feel I think it's very similar to

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.210 
the feel I think it's very similar to
the<00:06:21.229> sugar<00:06:21.530> one<00:06:22.450> maybe<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:23.870> fresh<00:06:24.320> sugar<00:06:24.890> lip

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
the sugar one maybe the fresh sugar lip

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.050 
the sugar one maybe the fresh sugar lip
treatment<00:06:26.020> have<00:06:27.020> more<00:06:27.440> of<00:06:27.650> a<00:06:27.860> richer<00:06:28.490> texture

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
treatment have more of a richer texture

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.380 
treatment have more of a richer texture
