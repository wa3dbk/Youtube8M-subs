there's a very small oven called a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.850 
there's a very small oven called a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
travel buddy that's made in australia

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400 
travel buddy that's made in australia
and<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:10.080> small

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and they had one that's pretty small

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.720 
and they had one that's pretty small
then<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> bigger<00:02:11.220> one<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.489> was

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
then they have a bigger one I was

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.660 
then they have a bigger one I was
thinking<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> bigger<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.670> these

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
thinking about the bigger one but these

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.550 
thinking about the bigger one but these
things<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:15.060> over<00:02:15.209> two<00:02:15.480> hundred<00:02:15.660> dollars<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
things are over two hundred dollars and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
things are over two hundred dollars and
then<00:02:19.560> you've<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.920> pay<00:02:20.160> shipping<00:02:20.550> which<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
then you've got pay shipping which the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.619 
then you've got pay shipping which the
guy<00:02:21.989> said<00:02:22.349> was<00:02:22.530> 120<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.670> more<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:24.150> something<00:02:24.510> to

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
guy said was 120 or more or something to

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.010 
guy said was 120 or more or something to
get<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:24.989> from<00:02:25.170> Australia<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.810> big

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
get it here from Australia so the big

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.160 
get it here from Australia so the big
version<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.459> bit<00:02:30.150> over<00:02:30.450> 200<00:02:31.019> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
version is I think a bit over 200 so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
version is I think a bit over 200 so
it's<00:02:31.319> approaching<00:02:31.890> four<00:02:32.160> hundred<00:02:32.489> dollars<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's approaching four hundred dollars to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.759 
it's approaching four hundred dollars to
get<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.959> here<00:02:34.319> from<00:02:34.530> Australia<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:37.260> me<00:02:37.440> for

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
get it here from Australia and to me for

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.070 
get it here from Australia and to me for
the<00:02:37.879> use<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> would<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.480> putting<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.900> this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the use that I would be putting in this

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.540 
the use that I would be putting in this
thing<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.379> just<00:02:40.590> don't<00:02:40.769> think<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.099> worth<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
thing I just don't think it's worth that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.820 
thing I just don't think it's worth that
price<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.260> other<00:02:43.260> thing<00:02:43.560> I've<00:02:43.680> been

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
price and other thing I've been

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.770 
price and other thing I've been
considering<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.610> course<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:45.090> afraid<00:02:45.390> I've

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
considering of course is afraid I've

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.960 
considering of course is afraid I've
been<00:02:45.900> talking<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.370> I've

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.030 
been talking about that on here and I've
been<00:02:48.150> thinking<00:02:48.480> about<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.950> you

actually insert in and there's a couple
brands<00:02:55.080> I've<00:02:55.260> been<00:02:55.410> looking<00:02:55.739> at<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.730> around

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
brands I've been looking at there around

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
seven hundred or so and then of course

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.820 
seven hundred or so and then of course
there's<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.230> ice<00:03:01.230> chest<00:03:01.650> style<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.680> can

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
there's the ice chest style then you can

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.220

arrived

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.810 
arrived
yet<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:10.620> know<00:04:10.710> I'm<00:04:10.770> probably<00:04:10.950> around<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
yet you know I'm probably around a

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.180 
yet you know I'm probably around a
hundred<00:04:12.300> dollars<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.140> for<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.470> thing<00:04:13.770> so

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
hundred dollars or so for this thing so

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.920 
hundred dollars or so for this thing so
that's<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.460> much<00:04:14.640> more<00:04:14.850> attractive<00:04:15.360> price<00:04:15.630> tag

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
that's a much more attractive price tag

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.039 
that's a much more attractive price tag
than<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.320> four<00:04:16.560> hundred<00:04:16.830> dollar<00:04:16.980> oven<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:18.049> of

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
than the four hundred dollar oven and of

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.390 
than the four hundred dollar oven and of
course<00:04:19.290> there<00:04:19.470> was<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.620> option<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.040> go<00:04:20.220> with

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
course there was the option to go with

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.670 
course there was the option to go with
like<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.610> hundred<00:04:20.760> dollar<00:04:21.239> small<00:04:22.170> oven<00:04:22.440> like

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
like a hundred dollar small oven like

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.440 
like a hundred dollar small oven like
you<00:04:22.800> would<00:04:22.920> use<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.220> your<00:04:23.310> home<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.550> convection

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
you would use in your home a convection

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.610 
you would use in your home a convection
toaster<00:04:24.660> oven<00:04:25.170> but<00:04:25.260> i<00:04:25.320> would<00:04:25.470> need<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
toaster oven but i would need a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.350 
toaster oven but i would need a
generator<00:04:25.920> for<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.550> i<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:26.940> been<00:04:27.120> tempted

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
generator for that i have been tempted

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.100 
generator for that i have been tempted
to<00:04:27.720> invest<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.920> generator<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.640> run<00:04:29.940> my<00:04:30.180> AC

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
to invest in a generator to run my AC

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.540 
to invest in a generator to run my AC
but<00:04:31.770> for<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.760> thousand<00:04:33.240> bucks<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:35.250> know<00:04:35.370> i'm

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
but for a thousand bucks you know i'm

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.400 
but for a thousand bucks you know i'm
planning<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.150> future<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.750> travel<00:04:37.170> to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
planning in the future to travel to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.130 
planning in the future to travel to
places<00:04:37.830> where<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.280> weather<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.550> nice<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:39.870> is

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
places where the weather is nice this is

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.170 
places where the weather is nice this is
just<00:04:40.740> not<00:04:40.950> something<00:04:40.980> i<00:04:41.430> want<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.700> invest<00:04:42.000> in

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
just not something i want to invest in

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.000 
just not something i want to invest in
right<00:04:42.420> now<00:04:42.630> there's<00:04:43.290> other<00:04:43.470> practical

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
right now there's other practical

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.380 
right now there's other practical
considerations<00:04:44.730> like<00:04:44.820> where<00:04:45.150> would<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.300> keep

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
considerations like where would I keep

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.030 
considerations like where would I keep
it<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.930> know<00:04:45.960> I'd<00:04:46.140> have<00:04:46.260> to<00:04:46.380> get<00:04:46.530> some<00:04:46.770> kind<00:04:46.980> of

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
it you know I'd have to get some kind of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.290 
it you know I'd have to get some kind of
a<00:04:47.220> hitch<00:04:48.210> rack<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:49.260> keep<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.640> then<00:04:50.700> I'd

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
a hitch rack to keep it on and then I'd

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.200 
a hitch rack to keep it on and then I'd
have<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.510> have<00:04:51.660> security<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.860> know<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.210> chain

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
have to have security you know to chain

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.300 
have to have security you know to chain
it<00:04:54.240> down<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.440> rack<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.950> doesn't<00:04:56.250> get

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
it down to the rack so it doesn't get

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.730 
it down to the rack so it doesn't get
stolen<00:04:56.750> another<00:04:57.750> consideration<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.590> you've

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
stolen another consideration is you've

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.170 
stolen another consideration is you've
got<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:58.950> run<00:04:59.190> these<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.640> keep<00:04:59.820> them<00:05:00.000> running

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
got to run these to keep them running

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.600 
got to run these to keep them running
well<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.680> probably<00:05:01.920> just<00:05:02.070> wouldn't<00:05:02.460> use<00:05:02.580> it

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
well and I probably just wouldn't use it

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.730 
well and I probably just wouldn't use it
that<00:05:02.880> frequently<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:03.990> can<00:05:04.170> always<00:05:04.410> run<00:05:04.590> off

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
that frequently and I can always run off

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.700 
that frequently and I can always run off
shore<00:05:05.070> power<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:06.270> run<00:05:06.420> the<00:05:06.480> AC<00:05:06.690> for<00:05:07.530> now<00:05:08.480> so

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
shore power to run the AC for now so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.190 
shore power to run the AC for now so
this<00:05:10.710> made<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.100> just<00:05:11.250> all<00:05:11.490> around<00:05:11.630> easier<00:05:12.630> and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
this made it just all around easier and

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.409 
this made it just all around easier and
what<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.560> do<00:05:13.650> plan<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.160> do<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.669> in<00:05:14.880> case<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.240> need

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
what I do plan to do is in case I need
