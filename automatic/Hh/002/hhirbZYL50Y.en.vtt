00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.780
 no 4 tiger ii is welcome welcome for this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.740
 a new people who don't like me yet 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.809
 know it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm already effkes in dead dust but me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.779
 see you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 ghost doesn't commit much schiedam yet 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.000
 actually I have to think about it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.859
 and no comment yet but good I have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 learn to do that before I am on an internship 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 been for three and a half months afterwards 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 I just didn't have time so that's why 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 I have a comment in is easy 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 but well I 'm back and since that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 mr ducklings 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.710
 don't have time to do a commentary 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 this week i thought well i will learn 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.440
 to make 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 and I will immediately start worrying about you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 goodies now I want to add you say 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'm still playing a ps3 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 I don't have ps4 yet, unfortunately I already think so 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.440
 hard to give 400 ball all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.809
 new check where the difference is not 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.879
 is huge and I know the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 quality meter is i know this 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 times the servers are but i like it 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 not yet worth investing in it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.540
 so i still have a ps3 and it will 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 still take a while to get in 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.470
 so hank it is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 I come across a lot more difficult from someone 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.340
 against it is not that they are in gut cow 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 or as are actually a part 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 hugely bad but they have all 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 puppies and they immediately have a killstreak 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.650
 so especially helicopter family of those 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.360
 chopper kids 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.009
 so of course extremely difficult and awkward 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.320
 to play against 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.939
 nail not help who would rather let them 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.579
 see lie anyway can win things that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 men even if all cues have tricks 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.049
 now i can read about with rangers 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.740
 sparta nobody against and who are half 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 three remained 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.369
 we were eventually won and then 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.079
 we would go and feel good 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.759
 then the men broke down 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.979
 okay that they cannot win with it 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.329
 all your witch and so I ask myself 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 actually finished now only happens at 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.250
 us or also with you for 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 is 3 players to you of course I have 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.049
 a salami asked if it was with them 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.729
 was on ps4 no matter that he may here 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.649
 to be encountering is natural 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.810
 well yes i have to say it 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.960
 one of the reasons why I should 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 upgrade to a ps4 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.590
 it's just not fun to be with anyone 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.959
 a men to play and also that little one 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.850
 versus were also a huge number of hackers 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.830
 I do not play to empty happy 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.170
 black or stanley play great fun to the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.030
 player after that same already though 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.550
 they just now have the esports 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.820
 loosely implemented the heck has remained 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.410
 and that wo n't be to play on 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.390
 so let me know if that is the case with you too 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.580
 occurs and where you do what you 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 then more raicho players so that the search 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.920
 something sits that drives shows in that c4th ah 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.670
 against the male until then how 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.680
 lost at I think of one thing and one 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.340
 things linden and then madame I told you 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.380
 That 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.269
 acts the wolf of wall in the film 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.330
 street I think most of you 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.880
 who have already seen and there very often and 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.060
 I say about it there is simply the best movie 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.340
 and funniest film work root've seen 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.400
 my name is marco romy and she comes that 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.070
 Australia and the is just then I boom 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.570
 you have to pay more for brunettes 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.880
 but have brand and something of one 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.980
 be made an exception for her 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.870
 now you've seen the movie trick and that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.250
 You were my housemates and you 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.950
 they are all women 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.079
 there are real movie light bosses 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.840
 will not be boss light mass of the lake 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.060
 that it aimed 6 for the men 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.530
 yes i am sometimes belgian so i would 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.780
 I want to know what you are thinking of you 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.329
 abbey seen that room and and what was 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.850
 your first impression of the movie i know 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.200
 still the scene that she's completely naked in the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.630
 film appeared 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.170
 and then i do have a photos my eyes 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.480
 made people then I still click 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.269
 sit in my head 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.320
 no no that I am the porn commentary 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.400
 leaders we had we can mine 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.660
 forget face then may I know now 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.690
 no longer what I want to talk about 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.690
 to have 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.910
 your white 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.459
 have the gameplay around the kettle 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.620
 you see them myself 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.209
 Jim does not actually iron anything special 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.850
 well where charlie's the poll there here 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.560
 had had a very fast fight 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.680
 take one there is enough in call or duty 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.209
 ghosts in which it is remote or so that you 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.739
 pris can succeed 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.620
 as a place to study which was 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.080
 very handy so you see something 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.910
 tighter kim and I'll use the honey 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.380
 badger my shrink in red dot sight i 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 personally find that the best sitting 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.050
 for the honey badger and that sometimes i do 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.690
 the flu is in then the voice did the mixer 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.310
 on there is good shit too 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.070
 from longer in fact they are slightly less good 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.300
 then muse then I do not really help the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.039
 puppies 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 Scavenger when you necessarily have my first one 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.710
 she called this saelens and grigio 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.890
 profit and focus and a 5 course 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.260
 and still get overpowered with now 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.150
 that patch they released and 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.729
 then as a specialist something starts with 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.659
 scavenger and after that grip I don't use 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.640
 third 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.060
 because then I would get my bonus faster 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.039
 if I don't have a third and then 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.860
 eventually if I have my bonus then 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.810
 is the detail and then such a skull you 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.229
 do n't know i say hit it again and again 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.120
 then still slave and this is normal 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.610
 set my standard for pop so much 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.530
 now stay curious where you all are 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.840
 because I use this set-up 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.700
 for all my class except one is one 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.190
 crucial the only one in systems that I 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.409
 use is the enter and so far have 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.419
 no better syrup found in between 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.440
 just about in the bowl and circus julie's on it 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.300
 behind 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.560
 you can test you because i am so me 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.979
 got the ball a bit 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.140
 believe played four days or so and every 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.630
 times with the same set up I am third 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.760
 so four prestigious depressions and it 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.169
 is already hearing a little site so can 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.280
 sometimes a bit and so experiment 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.979
 let us know where you have it 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.870
 and he can mind to me movement we 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.610
 just normally 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.500
 always gives the friends the red scarf 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.539
 to someone and I also don't know how 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.180
