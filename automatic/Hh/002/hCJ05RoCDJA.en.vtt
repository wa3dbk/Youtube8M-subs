 with you again youtube gain channel fuel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 and this is my next series of minecraft 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.599
 and today I will not just do the usual 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.430
 reviews 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.800
 and today I will make such a guide by the way he 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.699
 will be serial you do n't think so 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.289
 that this is however a series of fashion guide 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 computer craft 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.269
 that is, craft the computer we have here 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 which is added which we perform 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 many functions 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.370
 the most important function we create 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 programs are all as in reality are all as 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 life your language spelling 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 here the language used is yu.a. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.260
 he exists but he is cut down here 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 small cut for simplicity 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 use but still mod pretty 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.340
 complicated and today we will disassemble the creation 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.920
 documents specifically the creation 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.899
 text file and the main ones here 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.769
 all sorts of commands for working with a computer 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 we have it as a console computer 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.299
 so some proteins and things like that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.689
 will be here where the computer is created with 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.320
 information I do not have a computer tycoon 2 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.840
 5 computers and so get up occupy us in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.979
 Right-click on a convenient position. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.530
 mouse on our own computer and 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 Now the first team that we hunt 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.680
 do it we help here we go 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.310
 all the commands that the computer can 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.280
 use ie it is very convenient 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.570
 how would such a mini help 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 the next command is important clear this 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
 team 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.340
 that's how it is spelled it clears the window it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 information is not deleted from your 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.439
 computer but only clears the window then 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.049
 have you written any garbage here 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.110
 this whole thing will interfere you write the command 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.189
 clear and it removes everything from the desktop 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.320
 that is, clears unnecessary information like this 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.730
 go ahead 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080
 now we want to create a file 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.410

 moment text and write necessarily 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.660
 let's say there is 80 but I for example is 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.209
 unreliable information is just me so 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.920
 doing 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.019
 1980 for example we all wrote right 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.380
 information here signs all letters numbers 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.930

 buttons we have here we press the safe 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.380
 To save the file, it says txt 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.030
 that is, the file is saved under the name txt 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.690
 Well basically I'm going to ask him the name 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.310
 press control again and press exit

 we all went back to the desktop 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.019
 How do I know that where this file is created 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.600

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.090
 are there any more badges 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.760
 namely points 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.850

 sit back again if we pick up here 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.910
 sit again 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.380

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.650
 we are not in any folder sitting like this 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.419
 Well, in general, these are the main commands for 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.150
 creating files we parsed them 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.430
