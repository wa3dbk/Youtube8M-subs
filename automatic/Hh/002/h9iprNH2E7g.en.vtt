00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this isn't right this is this supposed

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
this isn't right this is this supposed
to<00:01:41.220> happen<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.210> taking<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> back

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to happen all right I'm taking it back

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.010 
to happen all right I'm taking it back
into<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.439> lab<00:01:43.680> maybe<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.930> magnifying<00:01:45.930> glass

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
into the lab maybe the magnifying glass

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
into the lab maybe the magnifying glass
is<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> wrong<00:01:47.009> way<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.700> take<00:01:48.180> all

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
is on the wrong way all right take all

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.230 
is on the wrong way all right take all
tape<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:49.049> awesome<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> switched

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
tape off awesome and then I switched

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.139 
tape off awesome and then I switched
around<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.350> lens<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.009> flipped<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.880> over<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
around the lens just flipped it over to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
around the lens just flipped it over to
the<00:01:54.240> other<00:01:54.299> side<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.899> let's<00:01:55.890> give<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> try

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the other side and let's give that try

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.649 
the other side and let's give that try
alright<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.420> go

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
alright here we go

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.120 
alright here we go
and<00:02:00.630> no<00:02:01.630> that's<00:02:01.869> still<00:02:02.079> doesn't<00:02:02.319> work<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:03.100> I

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and no that's still doesn't work so I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.380 
and no that's still doesn't work so I
guess<00:02:03.399> there's<00:02:03.579> no<00:02:03.729> way<00:02:03.850> around<00:02:03.969> that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
guess there's no way around that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.700 
guess there's no way around that
whatever<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.780> watch<00:02:04.929> is<00:02:05.200> going<00:02:05.469> to<00:02:05.590> be

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
whatever you watch is going to be

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.740 
whatever you watch is going to be
flip-flopped<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:07.329> long<00:02:07.479> as<00:02:07.630> you're<00:02:07.719> not

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
flip-flopped as long as you're not

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.300 
flip-flopped as long as you're not
reading<00:02:08.049> any<00:02:08.170> subtitles<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.739> guess<00:02:08.920> that's<00:02:09.129> all

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
reading any subtitles I guess that's all

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.619 
reading any subtitles I guess that's all
right<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:09.670> honestly<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.119> doesn't<00:02:10.299> matter<00:02:10.479> cuz

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
right but honestly it doesn't matter cuz

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.360 
right but honestly it doesn't matter cuz
you<00:02:10.869> can't<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.500> much<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.799> first<00:02:11.980> place

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you can't see much in the first place

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.729 
you can't see much in the first place
then<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.299> that's<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.540> whole<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
then that's it that's the whole the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.160 
then that's it that's the whole the
whole<00:02:14.890> thing<00:02:15.099> way<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.519> go<00:02:15.810> Pinterest<00:02:16.810> if
