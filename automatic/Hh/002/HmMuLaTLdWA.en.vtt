isn't<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.230> good<00:03:11.530> either<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:12.700> if<00:03:12.819> we<00:03:12.880> go

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
isn't all that good either but if we go

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.729 
isn't all that good either but if we go
to<00:03:13.150> critical<00:03:13.930> path<00:03:14.079> analysis<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:14.680> example<00:03:15.040> i

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
to critical path analysis for example i

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.190 
to critical path analysis for example i
don't<00:03:17.739> want<00:03:17.859> that<00:03:17.889> on<00:03:17.980> let's<00:03:18.819> go<00:03:18.940> back<00:03:19.180> let's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.420 

see<00:03:25.530> i'm<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.769> try<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:26.950> find<00:03:27.099> a<00:03:27.250> good

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
see i'm going to try to find a good

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.390 
see i'm going to try to find a good
example<00:03:28.090> because<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:29.440> lot<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.620> them<00:03:29.769> where

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
example because in a lot of them where

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.920 
example because in a lot of them where
it's<00:03:30.549> black<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.150> means<00:03:31.329> you've<00:03:31.480> not<00:03:31.630> actually

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it's black it means you've not actually

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.369 
it's black it means you've not actually
recorded<00:03:32.349> audio<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.760> where<00:03:33.939> it's<00:03:34.150> green<00:03:35.110> it

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
recorded audio but where it's green it

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.960 
recorded audio but where it's green it
means<00:03:35.409> you<00:03:35.650> record<00:03:35.950> audio

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
means you record audio

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.520 
means you record audio
so<00:03:37.710> let's<00:03:38.710> have<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.920> look<00:03:39.010> at<00:03:43.200> cost<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.350> profit

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
so let's have a look at cost and profit

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.240 
so let's have a look at cost and profit
senses<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:47.470> might<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:47.830> be<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.980> good<00:03:48.130> example

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
senses this might not be a good example

wonderful subject no no it starts a
notebook<00:05:12.310> right<00:05:14.070> example<00:05:15.070> what<00:05:15.250> will<00:05:15.400> be

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
notebook right example what will be

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.640 
notebook right example what will be
asked<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.690> output<00:05:16.840> here<00:05:17.140> it<00:05:17.260> rewind

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
asked so the output here it rewind

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.290 
asked so the output here it rewind
because<00:05:18.130> didn't<00:05:18.430> hear

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.530 

yeah<00:05:24.160> no<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.190> did

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:39.190 

the<00:05:32.540> question<00:05:33.700> is<00:05:34.700> likely<00:05:35.570> to<00:05:35.870> be<00:05:37.990> wrapped<00:05:38.990> up

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
the question is likely to be wrapped up

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.870 
the question is likely to be wrapped up
at<00:05:39.380> table<00:05:39.890> as<00:05:40.240> filling<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.390> gaps<00:05:44.680> all<00:05:45.880> very

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
at table as filling the gaps all very

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.120
