well I am going to give you a little
report<00:00:05.899> on<00:00:06.590> the<00:00:07.130> school<00:00:07.400> in<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.700> clouds

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
report on the school in the clouds

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.439 
report on the school in the clouds
project<00:00:09.430> well<00:00:10.430> firstly<00:00:10.790> for<00:00:11.000> those<00:00:11.119> of<00:00:11.299> you

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:11.449 
project well firstly for those of you

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.600 
project well firstly for those of you
who<00:00:11.629> don't<00:00:11.660> know<00:00:11.990> what<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.070> school<00:00:13.340> in<00:00:13.490> the

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
who don't know what the school in the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.160 
who don't know what the school in the
clouds<00:00:13.850> project<00:00:14.449> is<00:00:15.610> there<00:00:16.610> used<00:00:16.789> to<00:00:16.940> be<00:00:17.170> many

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
clouds project is there used to be many

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.220 
clouds project is there used to be many
years<00:00:18.500> ago<00:00:19.210> some<00:00:20.210> experiments<00:00:20.870> called<00:00:21.020> the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
years ago some experiments called the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.250 
years ago some experiments called the
hole<00:00:21.410> in<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.590> wall<00:00:21.970> which<00:00:22.970> basically<00:00:23.360> showed

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
hole in the wall which basically showed

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.460 
hole in the wall which basically showed
that<00:00:24.680> children<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.880> groups<00:00:26.150> can<00:00:26.420> learn<00:00:26.690> to<00:00:27.020> use

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
that children in groups can learn to use

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.080 
that children in groups can learn to use
a<00:00:27.500> computer<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.100> the<00:00:28.310> internet<00:00:28.730> by

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
a computer and the internet by

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:43.579 
a computer and the internet by
themselves

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.200 

those<00:00:44.589> experiments<00:00:45.309> led<00:00:45.519> to<00:00:45.909> further

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
those experiments led to further

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.170 
those experiments led to further
experiments<00:00:47.140> which<00:00:47.920> address<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.699> issue<00:00:49.149> of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
experiments which address the issue of

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.959 
experiments which address the issue of
well<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:50.350> what<00:00:50.649> I<00:00:50.680> mean<00:00:51.010> what<00:00:51.159> happens<00:00:51.550> after

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
well so what I mean what happens after

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.819 
well so what I mean what happens after
they<00:00:52.120> learn<00:00:52.329> how<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.570> use<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:53.079> computer<00:00:53.199> and

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
they learn how to use the computer and

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.039 
they learn how to use the computer and
what<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.579> found<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.059> they<00:00:55.390> can<00:00:55.449> then<00:00:55.600> use

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
what we found is that they can then use

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.020 
what we found is that they can then use
the<00:00:56.229> computer<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.710> do<00:00:57.010> whole<00:00:57.460> lot<00:00:57.670> of<00:00:57.699> things

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
the computer to do whole lot of things

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.859 
the computer to do whole lot of things
and<00:00:58.299> they<00:00:58.690> could<00:00:58.989> basically<00:01:00.659> answer<00:01:01.659> almost

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
and they could basically answer almost

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.380 
and they could basically answer almost
any<00:01:02.229> question<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.799> you<00:01:03.100> put<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.460> them<00:01:03.609> if

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
any question that you put to them if

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.880 
any question that you put to them if
they<00:01:04.930> work<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.350> groups<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.890> if<00:01:06.789> you<00:01:07.890> don't

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
they work in groups and if you don't

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.380 
they work in groups and if you don't
mess<00:01:09.100> around<00:01:09.250> with<00:01:09.610> them<00:01:09.819> you<00:01:09.940> know<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.119> mean<00:01:10.300> if

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
mess around with them you know I mean if

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.029 
mess around with them you know I mean if
you<00:01:10.479> don't<00:01:10.600> pour<00:01:10.899> over<00:01:11.229> their<00:01:11.409> shoulders<00:01:11.860> or

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
you don't pour over their shoulders or

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.100 
you don't pour over their shoulders or
something<00:01:12.310> like<00:01:12.429> that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:33.240 

yes<00:01:17.830> he<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.190> my<00:01:18.250> cousin<00:01:18.750> yeah<00:01:19.750> my<00:01:20.380> god

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.510 

this<00:01:34.250> kind<00:01:34.549> of<00:01:34.670> unsupervised<00:01:36.520> self-organized

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
this kind of unsupervised self-organized

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.690 
this kind of unsupervised self-organized
learning<00:01:38.439> went<00:01:39.439> into<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.860> schools<00:01:40.189> in<00:01:40.460> north

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
learning went into the schools in north

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.490 
learning went into the schools in north
eastern<00:01:41.030> England<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.600> became<00:01:41.899> what's<00:01:42.200> called

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
eastern England and became what's called

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.460 
eastern England and became what's called
a<00:01:42.819> self-organized<00:01:43.819> learning<00:01:44.289> environment<00:01:45.289> or

daddies you can see lots of them on the
dead<00:02:18.530> website<00:02:19.989> then<00:02:20.989> came<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.349> question<00:02:21.950> of

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
dead website then came the question of

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.949 
dead website then came the question of
who's<00:02:22.340> going<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.700> encourage<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.420> children<00:02:23.630> or

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
who's going to encourage the children or

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.350 
who's going to encourage the children or
you<00:02:26.959> know<00:02:27.110> excite<00:02:27.530> them<00:02:27.890> or<00:02:28.760> generally<00:02:29.209> be

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
you know excite them or generally be

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.309 
you know excite them or generally be
with<00:02:29.599> them<00:02:29.900> while<00:02:30.290> they're<00:02:30.500> doing<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
with them while they're doing this and

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.100 
with them while they're doing this and
for<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.500> purpose<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:35.209> God<00:02:35.450> created<00:02:35.959> is

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
for that purpose what God created is

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.199 
for that purpose what God created is
called<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.500> granny<00:02:36.799> cloud<00:02:37.220> which<00:02:38.030> is

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
called the granny cloud which is

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.020 
called the granny cloud which is
basically<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.920> group<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.430> people<00:02:40.790> who<00:02:40.910> are

basically in a group of people who are

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
basically in a group of people who are
interested<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.660> children<00:02:42.170> not<00:02:42.709> necessarily

granny cloud together into one

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.569 
granny cloud together into one
environment<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.590> have<00:03:37.010> something<00:03:37.310> which<00:03:37.459> is

environment you have something which is

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.160 
environment you have something which is
a<00:03:37.610> little<00:03:37.940> bit<00:03:38.060> different<00:03:38.450> from<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.720> soul<00:03:38.930> and

it little bit different from the granny
cloud<00:03:41.049> we<00:03:42.049> gave<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.560> name<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.010> school<00:03:43.190> in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
cloud we gave it the name the school in

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.420 
cloud we gave it the name the school in
the<00:03:43.940> cloud<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.049> essentially<00:03:45.590> what<00:03:46.190> these

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the cloud so essentially what these

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.390 
the cloud so essentially what these
things<00:03:46.459> are<00:03:46.970> are<00:03:47.299> like<00:03:47.840> cyber<00:03:48.590> cafes<00:03:49.129> for

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
things are are like cyber cafes for

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.990 
things are are like cyber cafes for
children<00:03:49.879> with<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> possibility<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.500> a

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000

electronic mediator coming on the wall
from<00:03:55.459> somewhere<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.349> required<00:03:58.629> they

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
from somewhere if that is required they

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.580 
from somewhere if that is required they
are<00:04:00.340> essentially<00:04:01.510> without<00:04:02.590> physical

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
in the cloud people ask me this very

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.680 
in the cloud people ask me this very
often<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:19.340> answer<00:04:19.639> is<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.479> no

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
often and the answer is that I have no

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.409 
often and the answer is that I have no
clue<00:04:20.870> because<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.680> have<00:04:21.769> never<00:04:21.950> built<00:04:22.190> one<00:04:22.389> so<00:04:23.389> I

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
clue because I have never built one so I

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.750 
clue because I have never built one so I
don't<00:04:23.690> know<00:04:23.900> if<00:04:24.020> my<00:04:24.050> design<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.590> right<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.310> I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
don't know if my design is right and I

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.000 
don't know if my design is right and I
don't<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.270> what's<00:04:26.479> going<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.780> happen<00:04:27.010> the
