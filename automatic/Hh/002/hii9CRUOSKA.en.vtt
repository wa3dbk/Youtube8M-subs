know<00:01:51.420> before<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> thing<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.319> think<00:01:52.560> there

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
know before it was a thing I think there

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.000 
know before it was a thing I think there
would<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.860> happen

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
would just happen

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.710 
would just happen
like<00:01:55.400> someone<00:01:55.760> someone<00:01:56.150> good<00:01:56.300> what<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.510> start

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
like someone someone good what you start

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.570 
like someone someone good what you start
trying<00:01:56.870> something<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.980> media<00:01:58.130> would<00:01:58.430> come

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
trying something the media would come

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.220 
trying something the media would come
around<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.940> then<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.540> think<00:01:59.780> everyone<00:02:00.140> else

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
around and then I think everyone else

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.200 
around and then I think everyone else
would<00:02:00.500> naturally<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:00.980> like<00:02:01.100> Oh<00:02:01.280> everyone's

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
would naturally be like Oh everyone's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.430 
would naturally be like Oh everyone's
there<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:02.510> gonna<00:02:02.690> try<00:02:02.870> something<00:02:03.140> hard<00:02:03.290> too

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
there I'm gonna try something hard too

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.570 
there I'm gonna try something hard too
so<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.890> would<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.010> become<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:04.520> like

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
so then it would just become this like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.940 
so then it would just become this like
session<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.570> everyone<00:02:05.870> trying<00:02:06.230> to<00:02:06.410> rip<00:02:06.830> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
session of everyone trying to rip the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:21.949 
session of everyone trying to rip the
hand<00:02:07.130> round
