00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.169
 public

 You're disengaging right video. 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.659
 I ask 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.829
 How many times have you disappeared, for example? 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.650
 who was poorly attended 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.980
 the driver 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 sometimes not one complemented 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 traffic has not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 nor confirmed destination requested in many others nor do I know who is the recipient 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.940
 polemic exit for this 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 How many times has this happened? 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.720
 other times you are not this 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.850
 you defeated chelsea by transaction chest 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.280
 other embedded technology and also 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.050
 the attendant without a minimum of education 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.560
 understand and endeavor to serve you 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.850
 with that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.030
 no kind gesture you sent of cement with you is in your store 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.650
 How many times has this happened? 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.870
 I ask again 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.120
 and the employees of your company 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.410
 how they serve their visitors and customers 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.180
 will these visitors and customers 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.010
 have the same feelings for your company 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.800
 the same way you have to do with these taxi drivers 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 few store employees mentioned earlier 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 did you know that was demonstrated by the camera? 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.150
 from rio de janeiro 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.340
 that 65% of the caldas by the fourth 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 customers abandoned their suppliers and maybe your company 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.170
 is due to the lack of an adequate ibmec care 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.510
 in such an important quality jump 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.860
 and that most of the time has forgotten 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.020
 English had fremantle 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.680
 to all famous to supply in crisis the customer service 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 they spoke next 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.910
 customer service is the test 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.210
 you can do everything right in terms of employment of the other services 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.909
 marketing pressure 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.109
 but I do not know if you have completed the advisor 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.109
 with incredibly good customer service 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.779
 at risk 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.959
 depends on business or even going out of business 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.619
 result to dance observe 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.590
 many organizations invests in focus 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.859
 tombs in buildings facilities 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.920
 magnificent and hearts 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.169
 advanced marketing technologies 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.429
 2 more sophisticated checks 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.429
 but the stage in something so simple and cheap 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.139
 do not train your employees in front 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.859
 to attend with professionalism 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.089
 your visitors and customers 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.900
 receptionists secretaries the trend of controversy 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.279
 telemarketing operators who on Saturday 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:01.110
 messengers employers clerk the house attendants 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.940
 personal security personnel and our service concessionaires. 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.459
 among others 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.969
 mostly 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.919
 do not receive training 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.659
 professional 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.209
 these employees are bad 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.460
 the entrance door 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.919
 and the presentation of your company 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.309
 and almost always 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.319
 are the ones that most impacted the image of your organization 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.509
 it's inconceivable 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.689
 that many companies then have these employees 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.559
 I do not have the ball to smile 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.649
 this record is an audience 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.919
 which does not deal in a professional and educated way 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.019
 visitors with visited 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.359
 that do not promptly respond with competence to requests 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.010
 I will become action 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.299
 I have given many other qualities in service 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.259
 who are always told 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.439
 easy 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.969
 low cost for you 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.479
 are staged 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.919
 presentation of these qualities it is imperative that the company really 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.319
 professional 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.300
 competent 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.779
 and concerned about your customers 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.919
 they are more important 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.359
 is the awareness that visitors and customers will always 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.409
 qualities 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.139
 are requirements is inescapable 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.929
 noncompliance with these waivers 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.840
 will rot in his constant 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.479
 loss of customers 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.330
 will disappear because of the renault efficiency of these organizations 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.419
 doing the symbolic analysis 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.610
 You can say that every company 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.509
 works as a water tank 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.210
 priority 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.390
 commercial executives intend to increase their volume 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.050
 new customers exclusively through 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.900
 top kanu 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.770
 the increase in sales 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.550
 it is no use promoting this principle its inferior positions 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.550
 of this tank 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.849
 can be a rapid and sharp loss of old customers 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.219
 the first to do is so countries cited 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.170
 but even 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.559
 trying to increase sales 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.400
 it is more logical 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.559
 reasonable 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.069
 fast 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.189
 the most economical start 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.270
 moritz 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.000
 to care courses 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.610

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.499
 we trained more beautiful 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.990
 thousand employees in the most varied companies 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.050

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.460
 highly satisfactory 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.470
 establishing a pattern of behavior and quality in care 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.529
 the trademark 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.110
 many of our clients hire us 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.610
 to provide training programs 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.550

 theoretical-practical 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.370
 in rapid assimilation I invite them to appropriate in electronic recordings 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.699
 of participants 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.869
 which shows the progress made 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:10.710
