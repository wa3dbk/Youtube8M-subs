medium flex I'd probably say it's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
medium flex I'd probably say it's
something<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> 4<00:00:26.550> out<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> 10<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
something like a 4 out of 10 is a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
something like a 4 out of 10 is a
