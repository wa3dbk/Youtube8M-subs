00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.850
 hi friends today i want you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.099
 show how to make a hand stitch 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.220
 it is usually used for processing edges 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.700
 products or if you for example have 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.050
 appliqué and you want a beautiful and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.829
 frame you can do it not necessarily 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.100
 on the cut but also on the plane 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 he replaces such an overlock machine 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.170
 there is this manual look you can say 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.780
 overlock 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 applies it to your soft toys 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 for processing hard to reach places if 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.219
 you have overclocked somewhere, that is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.930
 the seam is very often applicable and very 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.090
 pleased with such durable decorative 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.270
 attractive we i will show you on 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.369
 a contrasting background I don't have to another 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.430
 colors so you can see better 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 we can sew as one thread so v2 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 if we sew two strings naturally 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.939
 we tie a knot and fasten it to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.420
 we determine the necessary distance for ourselves 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.340
 but what is the distance from the edge we will have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 I will define these loops approximately a floor 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:46.040
 centimeter and fasten our thread in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.040
 fabrics 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.960
 if you have a cloth and you are loose and loose 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.450
 you can not start like this 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.469
 how would you knot rested against the tissue 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.390
 and do like a loop that is to thread 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.399
 still between the threads needle and you will 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.489
 strong is such a loop that is no longer 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.310
 does not jump out of loose fabric 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.319
 loose up 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.140
 arsen type he or some kind of artificial 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.690
 fur she will have you very tightly 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.540
 keep on and on we start our own 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 the seam itself is trying to do the same 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:30.849
 the distance between the loops stick 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:33.610
 needle through and on we have to 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.550
 do so there are different 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.160
 I consider ways to sew myself 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.950
 what should be a safe way 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.090
 sewing a needle from myself so God forbid 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.340
 don't bother showing you that way and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 you have to do this 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.069
 thread turned out to be a needle 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.900
 you can do it at the same time can 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:04.780
 with hands toss over here and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:08.349
 for the needle and start to tighten and now 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.900
 we get the top like this 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.470
 here comes the thread, that is, you don’t 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.640
 just like these loops like 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.290
 tracer around the fabric 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.790
 imitation here's another overlock that is 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 additional thread which 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 protects the cut from above following 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.859
 next peak needle 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.079
 call we must do always on 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.540
 equal distance i.e. if you 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.989
 two millimeters died stick on 2 then 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.889
 there are more often than you stitches so of course 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.880
 more beautiful 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.600
 seam here if it is somewhere inside it is possible and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.019
 wider 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.709
 take a step here I stuck it to you and 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.340
 so now about again we pierce 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.150
 through 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:06.069
 you can again throw hands 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:11.970
 immediately pierce and here the needle to withdraw 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:14.970
 immediately to the thread and again pulling 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.970
 upstairs 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.110
 Here we do not tighten so much 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.030
 this thread she turned out to be with us 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:30.020
 above that is not somewhere on the side but on top 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.310
 measure exactly the same distance again 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.460
 sticking a needle, remove the back of your finger 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:53.790
 so as not to pierce the thread for 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:55.980
 igloo and pull here on a little bit 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:05.970
 uncomfortable shows you what new 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:14.630
 The camera is so not very visible 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:18.960
 handy here and continue this process 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.510
 until the very end on this stitch goes away 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.980
 pretty decent amount of threads you 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:29.120
 it is necessary to thread the thread quite often 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.440
 needle and again make a knot and 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.790
 continue the seam because all the same 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.410
 thread consumption 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:42.810
 big go for this seam wear in beautiful 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.720
 If you insert wool by the way in 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.880
 knitted woolen products 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.680
 same stitch 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:55.430
 apply and in some 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.380
 tack x and toys in general is very 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.720
 I show you a beautiful option now 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.050
 exactly 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:08.040
 loop stitch for the edge here look 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:11.730
 see what are the top here strings 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.630
 That's how time-time-time-time here and back 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:20.400
 it turns out the same here from the inside 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:24.780
 we get the usual here such as 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.680
 would stitches here if you try 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.139
 do at the same distance they are with you 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.870
 there will be generally indistinguishable machine 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.080
 line that is, suppose it 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.840
 the wrong side and on the face will be generally imperceptible 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.449
 that you have done something and all hands 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.090
 you are both cheated and sewn 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.090
 at the same time here is such a 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:54.669
 the seam is beautiful and pretty simple 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:58.360
 here's the thread we naturally have to face 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:03.520
 how to change it to fix well and 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:08.130
 bring somewhere in the side and continue 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.610
 farther again not. there was such a video and 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.610
 bye everyone
