the ones at the moment a bit more like
Square<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.120> I'm<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> bit<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.750> wider<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.430> yeah

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Square and I'm a bit like wider so yeah

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360 
Square and I'm a bit like wider so yeah
12<00:01:15.660> pounds<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.380> may<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.250> one

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
12 pounds well I may have to get one

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.280 
12 pounds well I may have to get one
because<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.240> strapless<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
because the strapless one is kind of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460 
because the strapless one is kind of
going<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> might<00:01:21.630> break<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going and I think it might break this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.540 
going and I think it might break this
the<00:01:23.150> shoulder<00:01:24.150> handles<00:01:24.830> already<00:01:25.830> broke<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.370> it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
the shoulder handles already broke on it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.830 
the shoulder handles already broke on it
so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.350> goes<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.840> you're
