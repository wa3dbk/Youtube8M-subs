00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.379
 quotation marks 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.900
 I'm personally very interested 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.960
 interest a eurolines t8 in green 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 So men reasons why the roll 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:33.649
 for the sake of course, the color is blue with 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:38.660
 yellow stripes on a green blue yellow 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.780
 green above all things so r green and it 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.260
 juicy meadows green would be okay but im 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.059
 browserergame friends on a green 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.100

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 the version 1.2 no idea what the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 version 1.1 and version 1.4 had 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.270
 has the green understand 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.090
 above all things version 1.2 and there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.799
 were not worked clean 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.650
 happened is a great start will be 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.479
 Brand symbol whether you are here in any case 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 Clean patch 1 worked that we did 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.840
 here and there other side with these and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.930
 quotation marks ventilation grille one has 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 Here only green places you transnet 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 has under the quotation marks 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 Nevertheless, ventilation grille to whom 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.060
 stalact but writes back there are 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 definitely 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 apparently is there would brush 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.690
 Slipped funny at the connections 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.140
 This is 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.980
 Everything is original is contrary to the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 leave a choice 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.810
 sick of course makes that knowledge 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.940

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.600
