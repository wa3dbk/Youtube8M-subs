lobby and hang out for a little bit

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.679 
I think it was just something easy to do
and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.409> don't<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.850> pissed<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.299> mom<00:01:33.509> off

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
him one day just just to know where he

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.050 
him one day just just to know where he
lived<00:04:11.910> but<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.420> drove<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.530> hatchback<00:04:14.060> chevette

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
lived but I drove a hatchback chevette

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.949 
lived but I drove a hatchback chevette
with<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.270> luggage<00:04:15.600> rack<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.140> top<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.980> um

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
with a luggage rack on the top that um

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.960 
with a luggage rack on the top that um
didn't<00:04:18.959> blend<00:04:19.200> into<00:04:19.470> traffic<00:04:19.830> at<00:04:20.130> all<00:04:20.250> really

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
didn't blend into traffic at all really

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.310 
didn't blend into traffic at all really
it<00:04:21.840> no<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:23.280> was<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.510> think<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.780> only<00:04:24.930> one<00:04:25.169> in

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
it no it was and I think the only one in

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.620 
it no it was and I think the only one in
Dallas<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.190> couldn't<00:04:26.910> have<00:04:27.030> followed<00:04:27.270> him

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
Dallas so I couldn't have followed him

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.560 
Dallas so I couldn't have followed him
anywhere<00:04:28.050> without<00:04:29.060> totally<00:04:30.060> being<00:04:30.210> noticed

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
anywhere without totally being noticed

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.129 
anywhere without totally being noticed
so<00:04:31.229> I<00:04:31.700> was<00:04:32.700> smart<00:04:32.970> enough<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.360> not<00:04:33.479> try

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
so I was smart enough to not try

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.489 
so I was smart enough to not try
that<00:04:35.270> because<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.479> would<00:04:36.870> have<00:04:36.990> been<00:04:37.080> weird

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:37.499 
that because that would have been weird

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.040 
that because that would have been weird
too<00:04:37.860> because<00:04:38.789> he<00:04:39.300> knows<00:04:39.479> where<00:04:39.539> he<00:04:39.780> would<00:04:39.930> have

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
too because he knows where he would have

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.469 
too because he knows where he would have
gone<00:04:40.409> if<00:04:40.740> he<00:04:41.099> noticed<00:04:41.610> me<00:04:41.729> following<00:04:42.150> him<00:04:42.330> he

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
gone if he noticed me following him he

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.219 
gone if he noticed me following him he
would<00:04:42.629> have<00:04:42.719> driven<00:04:43.319> Oklahoma<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.189> think<00:04:44.430> that

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
would have driven Oklahoma I think that

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.760 
would have driven Oklahoma I think that
was<00:04:46.229> a<00:04:46.590> good<00:04:46.789> feel<00:04:47.789> good<00:04:47.999> I<00:04:48.449> don't<00:04:48.629> know<00:04:48.749> two<00:04:49.740> or

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
was a good feel good I don't know two or

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.350 
was a good feel good I don't know two or
three<00:04:50.099> years<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.699> too<00:04:51.029> long<00:04:51.150> went<00:04:51.300> to

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
three years of that too long went to

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.959 
three years of that too long went to
college<00:04:51.740> hanging<00:04:52.740> out<00:04:52.830> at<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.039> hotel<00:04:53.430> lobbies

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.769 

those<00:04:56.969> were<00:04:57.090> times<00:04:59.240> it's<00:05:00.240> just<00:05:00.300> there's<00:05:00.719> a

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
those were times it's just there's a

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.089 
those were times it's just there's a
suicidal<00:05:01.439> be<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.189> just<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.669> determined<00:05:03.360> to

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
suicidal be that just is determined to

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.439 
suicidal be that just is determined to
kill<00:05:05.099> itself<00:05:05.430> slamming<00:05:05.939> up<00:05:06.060> against

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
kill itself slamming up against

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.580 
kill itself slamming up against
something<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.289> I'm<00:05:07.500> afraid<00:05:07.949> it<00:05:08.159> might<00:05:08.279> be<00:05:08.310> me
