organ systems level the physiologist is
going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.249> ask<00:00:23.429> two<00:00:23.849> questions<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.749> how

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
going to ask two questions one is how

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200 
going to ask two questions one is how
does<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.529> organ<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.159> organ<00:00:26.490> system<00:00:26.909> work

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
does the organ and the organ system work

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509 
does the organ and the organ system work
and<00:00:27.539> secondly<00:00:28.349> what's<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.829> advantage<00:00:29.159> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and secondly what's the advantage that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.729 
and secondly what's the advantage that
this<00:00:29.909> organ<00:00:30.269> system<00:00:30.659> provides<00:00:31.079> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.409> body

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
this organ system provides to the body

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.940 
this organ system provides to the body
as<00:00:32.100> you<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.240> through<00:00:33.570> our<00:00:33.780> course<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.830> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
as you go through our course what you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
as you go through our course what you
will<00:00:35.070> find<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.970> will<00:00:36.120> learn<00:00:36.330> all<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
will find is that you will learn all the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.960 
will find is that you will learn all the
terms<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.470> concepts<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.430> deal<00:00:38.730> with

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
terms and concepts that deal with

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.270 
terms and concepts that deal with
specific<00:00:39.120> organ<00:00:39.960> systems<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
specific organ systems but that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
specific organ systems but that
importantly<00:00:42.000> you're<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.330> to<00:00:42.390> develop<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
importantly you're going to develop a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
importantly you're going to develop a
working<00:00:43.410> model<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.070> working<00:00:44.550> model<00:00:45.060> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
working model and this working model is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
working model and this working model is
going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> allow<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.530> understand<00:00:47.070> how

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
going to allow you to understand how

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
going to allow you to understand how
these<00:00:47.580> organ<00:00:48.000> systems<00:00:48.360> coordinate<00:00:48.990> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
these organ systems coordinate to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.790 
these organ systems coordinate to
maintain<00:00:50.130> life<00:00:50.400> in<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.940> constantly<00:00:51.690> changing

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
maintain life in a constantly changing

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
maintain life in a constantly changing
environment<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.550> model<00:00:53.910> allows<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
environment the model allows you to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
environment the model allows you to
relate<00:00:54.960> structure<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> function<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
relate structure to function to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.940 
relate structure to function to
interpret<00:00:57.150> physiologic<00:00:57.810> data<00:00:57.990> such<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.560> blood

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
interpret physiologic data such as blood

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.080

pressures<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> blood<00:01:01.620> gases<00:01:02.130> and<00:01:02.310> also

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pressures and and blood gases and also

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.270 
pressures and and blood gases and also
it's<00:01:03.450> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.870> allow<00:01:03.990> you<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.469> predict<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's going to allow you to predict the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.279 
it's going to allow you to predict the
changes<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.999> the<00:01:06.030> body<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.689> specific

changes of the body to specific

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.950 
changes of the body to specific
perturbations<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.909> kinds<00:01:09.359> of<00:01:09.450> changes<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
perturbations the kinds of changes that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
perturbations the kinds of changes that
we're<00:01:10.079> talking<00:01:10.259> about<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:11.009> acute<00:01:11.399> changes

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
we're talking about or acute changes

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.349 
we're talking about or acute changes
such<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> eat<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.039> bag<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> salty<00:01:15.210> potato

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
such as you eat a bag of salty potato

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.859 
such as you eat a bag of salty potato
chips<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.560> happens<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.999> also<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.600> have

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
chips what happens you also can have

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
chips what happens you also can have
situations<00:01:19.829> where<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.069> have<00:01:20.280> chronic<00:01:20.609> changes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
situations where we have chronic changes

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.239 
situations where we have chronic changes
you've<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.630> training<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> marathon<00:01:22.619> how

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
you've been training for a marathon how

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.130 
you've been training for a marathon how
does<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.490> body<00:01:23.729> responds<00:01:24.329> when<00:01:24.990> you're

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
does your body responds when you're

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.809 
does your body responds when you're
actually<00:01:25.350> running<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> marathon<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
actually running the marathon what is

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually running the marathon what is
happening<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.359> your<00:01:27.450> body<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.619> happens

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
happening to your body and what happens

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
happening to your body and what happens
if<00:01:29.069> you<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> low<00:01:29.939> salt<00:01:30.179> diet<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
if you go on to a low salt diet and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
if you go on to a low salt diet and
maintain<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> low<00:01:31.499> salt<00:01:31.710> diet<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> other

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
maintain a low salt diet the other

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.429 
maintain a low salt diet the other
things<00:01:33.569> that<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.929> do<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.319> we're

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
things that we're going to do is we're

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.139 
things that we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.649> be<00:01:34.740> using<00:01:34.770> throughout<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.639> courses

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
going to be using throughout the courses

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.029 
going to be using throughout the courses
little<00:01:36.509> case<00:01:36.810> studies<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:37.740> case

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
little case studies and these case

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.099 
little case studies and these case
studies<00:01:38.069> are<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:38.880> allow<00:01:39.329> us<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> perturb

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
studies are going to allow us to perturb

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.679 
studies are going to allow us to perturb
the<00:01:40.380> body<00:01:40.679> and<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.069> normal<00:01:41.429> responses<00:01:42.119> but

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the body and get normal responses but

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.499 
the body and get normal responses but
we're<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.109> going<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.649> looking<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.280> how

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
we're also going to be looking for how

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.179 
we're also going to be looking for how
what<00:01:45.509> happens<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.200> normal<00:01:46.590> responses

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
what happens when these normal responses

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.660 
what happens when these normal responses
actually<00:01:47.579> fail<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.539> end<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:48.929> disease

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
actually fail and we end up with disease

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.219 
actually fail and we end up with disease
so<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.789> course<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> targeted<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so the course is targeted then to
