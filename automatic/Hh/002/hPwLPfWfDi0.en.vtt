00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
grip on the steel is as follows this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.890 
grip on the steel is as follows this
would<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> normal<00:00:26.490> baseball<00:00:26.789> bat<00:00:27.300> grip<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.779> I

now<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.140> oval<00:00:37.559> base<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.070> all

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
now there's an oval base that all

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
now there's an oval base that all
Steel's<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> want<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
Steel's have what I want you to do is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
Steel's have what I want you to do is
make<00:00:41.250> sure<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.940> long<00:00:42.480> part<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
make sure that the long part of this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.190 
make sure that the long part of this
base<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.739> facing<00:00:44.460> towards<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.059> body<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.079> in

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
base is facing towards your body so in

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.369 
base is facing towards your body so in
case<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.649> miss<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.670> goes<00:00:48.390> into<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> steel

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
case I do miss it goes into the steel

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
case I do miss it goes into the steel
base<00:00:49.770> instead<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.489> obviously<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:51.390> hand

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
base instead of obviously into my hand

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
base instead of obviously into my hand
these<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.800> safety<00:00:53.219> precautions<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.000> ensure

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
these two safety precautions will ensure

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
these two safety precautions will ensure
that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.140> won't<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.649> caught

now my arm is bent away from my body my

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.060 
now my arm is bent away from my body my
steel<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> almost<00:01:01.260> perpendicularly<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.039> a

slight angle what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
slight angle what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> utilize<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.129> motion<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:06.000> wrist

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
going to utilize the motion of my wrist

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
going to utilize the motion of my wrist
and<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:06.960> shoulder<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.619> shoulder<00:01:08.010> stays

fixed<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.869> sharpen<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.040> knife

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fixed I'm going to sharpen the knife

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.240 
fixed I'm going to sharpen the knife
from<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> heel<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> its<00:01:12.420> tip<00:01:12.750> trying<00:01:13.590> only<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
from the heel to its tip trying only to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640 
from the heel to its tip trying only to
use<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> top<00:01:14.939> half<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> steel<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
use the top half of the steel now you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.120 
use the top half of the steel now you
you<00:01:17.280> alternate<00:01:18.210> strokes<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> each<00:01:19.409> side<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you alternate strokes on each side of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
you alternate strokes on each side of
the<00:01:20.520> sharpening<00:01:21.000> steel<00:01:21.619> utilizing<00:01:22.619> an

knife<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> correctly<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.939> will

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
knife if you do it correctly you will

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
knife if you do it correctly you will
not<00:01:27.299> hear<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> clanging<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> banging<00:01:29.310> sound

not hear a clanging or a banging sound

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.810 
not hear a clanging or a banging sound
it<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> nice<00:01:31.009> gliding<00:01:32.009> sound<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.729> an

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it will be the nice gliding sound of an

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.929 
it will be the nice gliding sound of an
ice<00:01:33.119> skate<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.380> first<00:01:34.710> start<00:01:34.979> slow<00:01:35.340> obviously

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
ice skate so first start slow obviously

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.749 
ice skate so first start slow obviously
all<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> wrist<00:01:36.780> twenty<00:01:37.710> degrees<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.430> each

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
all in the wrist twenty degrees on each

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.770 
all in the wrist twenty degrees on each
side<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.850> once<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> gain<00:01:42.479> confidence

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
side and then once you gain confidence

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859 
side and then once you gain confidence
and<00:01:43.350> obviously<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.189> speed<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and obviously you can speed it up but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
and obviously you can speed it up but
notice<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.350> only<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.399> top<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
notice I'm only using the top of the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
notice I'm only using the top of the
steel<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.840> even<00:01:49.079> coming<00:01:49.350> near<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
steel I'm not even coming near the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.679 
steel I'm not even coming near the
bottom<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> steel<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.570> ensure

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
bottom of the steel and that will ensure

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.550 
bottom of the steel and that will ensure
that<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.350> never<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:53.100> caught<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that you never get caught and you really

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
that you never get caught and you really
only<00:01:55.770> need<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.490> six<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.149> seven<00:01:57.540> strokes<00:01:57.960> let

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
