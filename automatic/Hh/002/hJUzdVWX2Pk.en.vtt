00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
little duo I'm taking a mac 217 and

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.679 
little duo I'm taking a mac 217 and
getting<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.490> bunch<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.789> that<00:02:04.969> navy<00:02:05.299> blue<00:02:05.329> color

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
getting a bunch of that navy blue color

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.850 
getting a bunch of that navy blue color
onto<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.140> end<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.560> brush<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.280> um<00:02:08.860> I'm

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
onto the end of the brush and um I'm

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.650 
onto the end of the brush and um I'm
just<00:02:10.100> going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> start<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:10.940> low<00:02:11.240> as<00:02:11.570> possible

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
just going to start as low as possible

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.580 
just going to start as low as possible
and<00:02:12.290> then<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:12.680> always<00:02:13.040> work<00:02:13.310> your<00:02:13.610> way<00:02:13.790> up

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and then you can always work your way up

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230 
and then you can always work your way up
but<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.190> wiggle<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.820> brush<00:02:16.850> back

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
but I like to just wiggle the brush back

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.430 
but I like to just wiggle the brush back
and<00:02:17.420> forth<00:02:17.570> there's<00:02:17.780> really<00:02:17.900> no<00:02:18.080> need<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.350> go

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
and forth there's really no need to go

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.309 
and forth there's really no need to go
all<00:02:18.470> over<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.860> place

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
all over the place

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.809 
all over the place
start<00:02:19.469> off<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.799> can<00:02:19.950> always<00:02:20.189> add<00:02:20.400> more<00:02:20.430> later

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
start off you can always add more later

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.929 
start off you can always add more later
but<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> key<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.590> blue<00:02:23.040> eyeshadow<00:02:23.219> is

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
but I think the key to blue eyeshadow is

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.039 
but I think the key to blue eyeshadow is
to<00:02:24.749> kind<00:02:25.049> of<00:02:25.200> keep<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.799> um<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.510> outermost

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
to kind of keep it um in that outermost

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.170 
to kind of keep it um in that outermost
corner<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.189> really<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.969> need<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
corner and like really you don't need to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.250 
corner and like really you don't need to
move<00:02:30.299> your<00:02:30.359> brush<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.780> much<00:02:30.959> at<00:02:31.109> all<00:02:31.200> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
move your brush that much at all just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.339 
move your brush that much at all just
kind<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.739> let<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.480> go<00:02:33.480> where<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.079> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.260> go

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
kind of let it go where it's going to go

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.610 
kind of let it go where it's going to go
for<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:34.859> minute<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.489> um<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.349> don't

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
for a minute and then um I really don't

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.309 
for a minute and then um I really don't
like<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.859> blend<00:02:38.129> blue<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.819> up<00:02:39.060> onto<00:02:39.989> my<00:02:40.139> brow

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
like to blend blue like up onto my brow

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.289 
like to blend blue like up onto my brow
bone<00:02:40.349> area<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.430> instead<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.760> doing<00:02:41.939> that<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
bone area so instead of doing that I

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.000 
bone area so instead of doing that I
like<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.019> pull<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.439> out<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.980> side

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
like to kind of pull it out to the side

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.890 
like to kind of pull it out to the side
I<00:02:44.280> think<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.909> gives<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.269> like<00:02:45.419> a<00:02:45.450> really

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
I think it gives you like a really

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.069 
I think it gives you like a really
elegant<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> regal<00:02:48.000> look<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:48.930> you

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
elegant kind of regal look and then you

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.289 
elegant kind of regal look and then you
can<00:02:49.260> start<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:50.129> know<00:02:50.280> blending<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.879> around<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
can start you know blending it around a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.379 
can start you know blending it around a
little<00:02:51.329> bit<00:02:51.780> more<00:02:51.959> like<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.939> do<00:02:53.939> like<00:02:54.359> to

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
little bit more like that I do like to

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.940 
little bit more like that I do like to
lift<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:55.260> outer<00:02:55.409> corner<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:55.859> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
lift it in that outer corner just so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.879 
lift it in that outer corner just so
it's<00:02:56.099> not<00:02:56.219> like<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.359> get<00:02:57.629> some<00:02:57.959> it

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
it's not like just so you get some it

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.179 
it's not like just so you get some it

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.810 
it can be hard to figure out what to do
with<00:05:36.990> colors<00:05:37.380> like<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.340> think<00:05:38.370> that

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
with colors like that and I think that

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.340 
with colors like that and I think that
sometimes<00:05:39.000> when<00:05:39.450> you're<00:05:39.570> unsure<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:40.170> best

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
sometimes when you're unsure the best

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.230 
sometimes when you're unsure the best
way<00:05:40.530> is<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.860> just<00:05:40.980> add<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.340> little<00:05:41.580> pop<00:05:41.820> of<00:05:42.000> color

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
way is to just add a little pop of color

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.500 
way is to just add a little pop of color
and<00:05:42.570> kind<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.930> an<00:05:43.080> unexpected<00:05:43.710> place<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.510> use

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
and kind of an unexpected place and use

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.150 
and kind of an unexpected place and use
a<00:05:45.540> bright<00:05:45.870> color<00:05:46.080> like<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.650> help<00:05:46.800> blend

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
a bright color like that to help blend

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.390 
a bright color like that to help blend
out<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> kind<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.680> darker<00:05:49.680> color<00:05:49.920> it<00:05:50.190> gives

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
out a kind of a darker color it gives

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.600 
out a kind of a darker color it gives
you<00:05:50.550> just<00:05:50.730> an<00:05:50.910> extra<00:05:51.360> bit<00:05:51.570> of<00:05:51.600> added<00:05:51.990> dimension

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610
