00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
most people believe it was just because

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
most people believe it was just because
they<00:01:55.890> angered<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> gods<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:59.060> but

anyway they also pretty much enslaved
another<00:02:04.500> race<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> shows<00:02:06.119> that

another race so which kind of shows that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
another race so which kind of shows that
they<00:02:06.450> were<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.930> cruel<00:02:07.229> race<00:02:07.500> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they were kind of a cruel race that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.160 
they were kind of a cruel race that
being<00:02:08.280> slayed<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> foul<00:02:09.119> more

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
called snow elves at one point until the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.370 
called snow elves at one point until the
Dwemer<00:02:35.610> enslaved<00:02:36.150> them<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:36.930> that's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
Dwemer enslaved them but that's that's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.080 
Dwemer enslaved them but that's that's
for<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.620> different<00:02:37.890> topic<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.430> mean<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.940> want

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
for a different topic I mean if you want

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.390 
for a different topic I mean if you want
to<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.480> history<00:02:39.870> about<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.350> go<00:02:41.010> find<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to go in history about that go find a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.690 
to go in history about that go find a
different<00:02:41.520> video<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.840> anyway<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> how<00:02:44.489> they

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
different video but anyway so how they

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.540 
different video but anyway so how they
should<00:02:44.760> play<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.390> next<00:02:45.540> game<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.739> mean

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
should play in the next game I mean

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.910 
should play in the next game I mean
obviously<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.720> should<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.410> there<00:02:49.590> at

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
obviously they should be in there at

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740 
obviously they should be in there at
some<00:02:49.980> point<00:02:50.280> especially<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.420> game<00:02:51.450> is

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
some point especially if the game is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.470 
some point especially if the game is
going<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:51.989> held<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.620> Hammerfell<00:02:53.480> they're

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
going to be held in Hammerfell they're

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.570 
going to be held in Hammerfell they're
probably<00:02:54.690> more<00:02:55.080> likely<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> drummer

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
probably more likely to have a drummer

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.750 
probably more likely to have a drummer
backstory<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.830> perhaps<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> Dwemer

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
backstory and perhaps because the Dwemer

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.440 
backstory and perhaps because the Dwemer
if<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:01.680> say<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.010> Dwemer<00:03:02.340> return<00:03:02.790> may<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.150> like

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
if to say the Dwemer return may be like

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.630 
if to say the Dwemer return may be like
the<00:03:03.570> next<00:03:03.750> game<00:03:04.080> would<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> main<00:03:05.370> plot

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the next game would have the main plot

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.420 
the next game would have the main plot
having<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> Dwemer<00:03:06.840> return<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> world

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
having the Dwemer return to the world

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.180 
having the Dwemer return to the world
and<00:03:08.820> i<00:03:09.420> mean<00:03:09.570> that's<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.380> would<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.890> such

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
and i mean that's it's it would be such

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.850 
and i mean that's it's it would be such
a<00:03:11.220> big<00:03:11.670> event<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.440> its<00:03:13.680> game

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
a big event that it would have its game

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
a big event that it would have its game
of<00:03:14.040> its<00:03:14.160> own<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.700> would<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.120> massive<00:03:15.450> or

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of its own or would be a massive or

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.630 
of its own or would be a massive or
being<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.650> massive<00:03:16.829> dlc<00:03:18.079> so<00:03:19.079> either<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:20.519> know

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
being a massive dlc so either you know

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.370 
being a massive dlc so either you know
maybe<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.060> next<00:03:21.299> game<00:03:21.510> could<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.170> war

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
maybe the next game could have the war

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.900 
maybe the next game could have the war
between<00:03:22.560> Thalmor<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:25.500> empire<00:03:25.950> while

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
between Thalmor and the empire while

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.840 
between Thalmor and the empire while
having<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.540> massive<00:03:27.750> dlc<00:03:28.350> or<00:03:28.380> main<00:03:28.860> other<00:03:29.459> side

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
having a massive dlc or main other side

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.710 
having a massive dlc or main other side
story<00:03:30.209> massive<00:03:30.900> side<00:03:31.110> story<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.370> Dwemer

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
story massive side story of the Dwemer

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.600 
story massive side story of the Dwemer
so<00:03:33.720> i<00:03:34.019> mean<00:03:34.260> that's<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.709> an<00:03:34.799> idea<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.190> i

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
so i mean that's just an idea and i

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.340 
so i mean that's just an idea and i
think<00:03:35.910> everyone<00:03:36.150> kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.660> wants<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.930> see<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
think everyone kind of wants to see the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.660 
think everyone kind of wants to see the
return<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.860> Dwemer<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.340> how<00:03:38.459> would<00:03:38.519> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
return of the Dwemer and how would that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.819 
return of the Dwemer and how would that
play<00:03:39.030> out<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:40.049> we<00:03:40.200> would<00:03:40.320> learn<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.560> whole

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
play out because we would learn a whole

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.600 
play out because we would learn a whole
lot<00:03:40.890> more

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
lot more

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.050 
lot more
what<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> Dwemer<00:03:42.780> returns<00:03:43.230> somehow<00:03:44.060> maybe

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
what if the Dwemer returns somehow maybe

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.420 
what if the Dwemer returns somehow maybe
there's<00:03:45.299> some<00:03:45.450> secret<00:03:45.840> Dwemer

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
there's some secret Dwemer

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.310 
there's some secret Dwemer
civilization<00:03:47.430> still<00:03:47.670> alive<00:03:47.970> somewhere<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:49.019> i

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
civilization still alive somewhere so i

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.530 
civilization still alive somewhere so i
mean<00:03:49.530> who<00:03:49.769> knows<00:03:51.350> what<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.920> sure<00:03:53.239> but<00:03:54.239> i

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
mean who knows what it is for sure but i

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810 
mean who knows what it is for sure but i
hope<00:03:54.870> i<00:03:55.079> hope<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.739> Dwemer<00:03:55.980> do<00:03:56.280> return<00:03:56.610> at

hope i hope that the Dwemer do return at
some<00:03:57.030> point<00:03:57.299> because<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.350> be<00:03:58.440> pretty

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
some point because that would be pretty

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.030 
some point because that would be pretty
awesome<00:03:58.970> plot<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.360> through<00:04:00.690> maybe<00:04:01.350> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
awesome plot to go through maybe the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.319

depending on the ruins to like the
Dwemer<00:04:45.169> would<00:04:45.320> probably<00:04:45.590> repopulate<00:04:46.039> all<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
Dwemer would probably repopulate all the

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.300 
Dwemer would probably repopulate all the
ruins<00:04:47.090> -<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.570> try<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.780> take<00:04:47.990> back<00:04:48.229> over<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:49.160> how

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
ruins - and try to take back over so how

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.279 
ruins - and try to take back over so how
that<00:04:49.340> really<00:04:49.820> plays<00:04:50.060> out<00:04:50.300> is<00:04:50.479> going<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.080> kind

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
that really plays out is going to kind

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.860 
that really plays out is going to kind
of<00:04:51.320> be<00:04:51.440> hard<00:04:51.680> unless<00:04:52.039> they<00:04:52.610> returned<00:04:53.510> right<00:04:53.750> in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
the beginning of the game and maybe

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.640 
the beginning of the game and maybe
they've<00:04:56.120> been<00:04:56.330> there<00:04:56.510> for<00:04:56.810> maybe<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.350> couple<00:04:57.560> of
