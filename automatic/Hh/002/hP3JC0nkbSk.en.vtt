00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello in the series the manufacture of 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.330
 rocks in rail model making by the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.059
 fibrous coating method that we 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.500
 have prepared in the first video 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.199
 here is a second video that will help you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 explain how to realize it 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 parish as in state the products 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 how does the grave and so to help 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.279
 products I use a greenhouse the most 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.859
 cruel Mason preference if you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.809
 used stainless steel tools 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.070
 because the plaster is relatively 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.930
 corrosive you see I'm spreading the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 produced with a thickness of more or 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.969
 least half a centimeter way it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 to have enough engraving 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.520
 deep that to give a beautiful 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.940
 relief print 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.399
 you can obviously increase this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.129
 thick if you need it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 just know that the bigger the product 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 is thick plus the drying time will be 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.220
 water for a half layer 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 centimeter you have to count anyway 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 several days for a hardening 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.659
 complete but you can start to 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.380
 do the painting and patina after 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 a few hours already 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:26.009
 so I was grossly mixing 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.259
 fibrous trying to keep a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.509
 certain homogeneity in the thickness of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.509
 the layer that is not always obvious 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.360
 so this structure on which I 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.580
 am in the process of moving the product is 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 a small hill that serves me 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.869
 only to do tests it's up to 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.570
 say that it will not be installed on 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.360
 the network it will simply serve to 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 validate the engraving technique of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.820
 fibrous English and subsequently the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.140
 different painting techniques and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.140
 debaty and then will end up in the trash 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 of course during work if you 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.239
 notice that there is a left that is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.950
 Too much too thin or too much exceeds you 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.090
 can still retouch the product 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.629
 that is to say you can always in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.930
 add 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.840
 or you can their linked state and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.049
 repeat the engraving 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.420
 here I am reading not too much of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.540
 to keep a product that is not 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.049
 not too uniform nature hates 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:01.389
 it's linear and the uniform is here and 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.389
 the product is now you've gone 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.480
 after spreading the product we go 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.930
 now perform burning using 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.330
 simple spatula of painter this 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.580
 engraving will consist on the one hand online 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.650
 horizontal and vertical line 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.930
 I first start with the lines 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.989
 horizontals that represent the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 different layers of depositions of 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.670
 our sedimentary rocks 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.560
 in this case we are interested in 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.980
 Ardenne limestone so it's a rock 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.680
 which is made from small 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.810
 shells of a small dust 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.099
 Bunk shells together 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.019
 other 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.430
 these different layers of depositions 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.209
 these different layers 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.159
 strata so are going to be marked in this 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.700
 here horizontally you can their 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.970
 give a slight inclination since in 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.560
 function of ground movements 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.579
 after the testimony you have 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.959
 sometimes layers that are oriented 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:13.000
 up to 45 degrees this is I mark 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.349
 first the horizontal layers see the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.650
 work does not need a very large 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.650
 precision 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.120
 here are then marked the lines of 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.889
 fracture relatively 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.800
 random so these fractures are 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.700
 caused by the elements namely 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.070
 especially temperature differences 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.900
 it's called a fraction genius it's up to 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.699
 say that during the day and done very 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.610
 hot during the day 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.880
 during the night it's cold so these 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.470
 differences in temperatures causes 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.120
 constraints inside the rock 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.590
 which causes it to crack and 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
 so these are these different lines 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.460
 of fracture that I'm trying to 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.440
 represent I now resume the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.139
 horizontal lines that need to be in 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.360
 made the most marked since the 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.650
 different layers are much more 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.650
 visible that fractures 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.169
 you sometimes see the coating colin powell 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.889
 with a spatula and causes small 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.809
 asperity 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.139
 it does not matter it's a spirit and 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:22.569
 will disappear when we go through the 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.849
 continued past the brush with the 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:30.389
 different paints it'll round off a 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.389
 little bit the appearance of larouche 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.509
 roger does that in this case almost 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.180
 a gridline trying to be the 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.820
 less homogeneous and less regular 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:55.590
 possible so have an effect rather 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:06:00.229
 random knew that nature hated 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.229
 of what is square and regular 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.419
 the more you will repeat the nicks 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:21.710
 the more your rock will look degraded and 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.710
 the more the structure will be marked 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.739
 the fibrous envied technique especially 

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.389
 interesting to reproduce the rocks 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:34.389
 sedimentary, that is to say, for example 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:38.049
 calcareous shale 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.449
 sandstone these techniques that originally 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:42.219
 created by mister philippe moniotte a 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.989
 been taken over by jacques leplat you 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:46.360
 can also find a description 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:49.629
 complete in his book good kisses of 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.019
 easter iron where he stands with this 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:56.079
 technique the will of the region of 

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:57.369
 strasbourg of any pink sandstone you see 

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:59.199
 in places where it's a little bit 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:01.779
 more hungry or the engraving is a lot 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.610
 less pretty these places will be by the 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:05.349
 after 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.959
 covered with vegetation to leave 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.419
 appear that the parks the parties the 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:13.209
 the most successful here is the engraving 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.919
 is now over I will leave 

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:19.499
 to dry for a few hours before 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.499
 to attack the staining phase
