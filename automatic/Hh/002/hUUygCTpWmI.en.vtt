40k<00:03:47.590> universe<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:48.250> about<00:03:48.520> each<00:03:48.700> faction<00:03:49.030> for

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
40k universe is about each faction for

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.300 
40k universe is about each faction for
themselves<00:03:49.660> each<00:03:50.320> faction<00:03:50.650> vying<00:03:50.950> for<00:03:51.130> power

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
themselves each faction vying for power

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.550 
themselves each faction vying for power
each<00:03:51.850> faction<00:03:52.239> hating<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.200> trying<00:03:53.440> to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
each faction hating and trying to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.750 
each faction hating and trying to
destroy<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.280> other<00:03:54.400> factions<00:03:55.770> but<00:03:56.770> again<00:03:56.890> it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
destroy the other factions but again it

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.910 
destroy the other factions but again it
kind<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.360> reinforces<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.320> idea<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.650> they're

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
kind of reinforces the idea that they're

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.610 
kind of reinforces the idea that they're
going<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.480> deviate<00:04:01.480> from<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.020> law<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> little

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
going to deviate from the law a little

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.190 
going to deviate from the law a little
bit<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.190> respect<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.850> but<00:04:04.720> what<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.900> hope

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
bit in that respect and but what I hope

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.930 
bit in that respect and but what I hope
they<00:04:05.410> do<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:06.250> know<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.610> hope<00:04:07.300> they<00:04:07.510> don't

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
they do you know I hope they don't

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.729 
they do you know I hope they don't
change<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.209> law<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.420> suit<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.900> game<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.410> would

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
change the law to suit the game I would

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.470 
change the law to suit the game I would
rather<00:04:11.860> than<00:04:12.160> change<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.790> game<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.180> suit<00:04:13.330> the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
rather than change the game to suit the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.720 
rather than change the game to suit the
law<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.260> personal<00:04:14.590> opinion<00:04:14.860> but<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.550> am<00:04:15.670> very

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
law in my personal opinion but I am very

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.750 
law in my personal opinion but I am very
much<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.450> lawful<00:04:17.020> attic<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:18.250> really<00:04:18.580> do

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
much of a lawful attic and I really do

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.650 
much of a lawful attic and I really do
just<00:04:19.540> love<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.020> see<00:04:20.229> games<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.180> any<00:04:22.180> kinds<00:04:22.600> of

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
that its respective universe my personal

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.480 
that its respective universe my personal
speculation<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.310> going

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
speculation on this is that it's going

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.880 
speculation on this is that it's going
to<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:30.000> game<00:04:30.210> will<00:04:30.360> be<00:04:30.540> all<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.260> our<00:04:31.350> PvP

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
to be this game will be all of our PvP

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.590 
to be this game will be all of our PvP
and<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.870> hope<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:34.050> do<00:04:34.110> good<00:04:34.620> PVE<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> don't

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
and I hope they do good PVE but I don't

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.170 
and I hope they do good PVE but I don't
see<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:36.810> happening<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.440> see<00:04:38.040> being<00:04:38.610> very<00:04:38.910> much

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
see that happening I see being very much

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.800 
see that happening I see being very much

again<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.840> was<00:05:00.840> hoping<00:05:01.170> for<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.250> know

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
again I was hoping for I you know

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.640 
again I was hoping for I you know
there's<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.940> lot<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.150> items<00:05:03.420> in<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.290> Warhammer

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
there's a lot of items in the Warhammer

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.830 
there's a lot of items in the Warhammer
universe<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:05.370> I<00:05:05.610> was<00:05:05.730> hoping<00:05:05.970> for<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> really

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
universe and I was hoping for a really

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.080 
universe and I was hoping for a really
good<00:05:06.870> economy<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.530> terms<00:05:07.560> of<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:09.060> I

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
good economy in terms of that and so I

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.530 
good economy in terms of that and so I
do<00:05:09.480> hope<00:05:09.840> they<00:05:09.990> change<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.610> but<00:05:11.610> again<00:05:11.700> my

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
do hope they change that but again my

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.200 
do hope they change that but again my
expectation<00:05:13.380> is<00:05:13.590> not<00:05:13.860> particularly<00:05:14.490> high<00:05:14.880> at

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
expectation is not particularly high at

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.900 
expectation is not particularly high at
this<00:05:15.390> point<00:05:15.890> one<00:05:16.890> thing<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.250> they<00:05:17.370> did<00:05:17.730> come

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
this point one thing that they did come

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.760 
this point one thing that they did come
out<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.210> say<00:05:18.420> straight<00:05:18.780> away<00:05:19.050> is<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.320> the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
out and say straight away is that the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.700 
out and say straight away is that the
game<00:05:19.950> will<00:05:20.160> have<00:05:20.430> microtransactions<00:05:20.910> and

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
game will have microtransactions and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.900 
game will have microtransactions and
things<00:05:22.710> like<00:05:22.920> killing<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.340> moats<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.730> things

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
things like killing the moats and things

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.430 
things like killing the moats and things
like<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.090> definitely<00:05:24.660> going<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.020> be<00:05:25.200> in

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
like that definitely going to be in

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.340 
like that definitely going to be in
those<00:05:25.860> my<00:05:26.070> toes<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.480> microtransactions<00:05:27.480> what

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
those my toes and microtransactions what

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.470 
those my toes and microtransactions what
they<00:05:28.470> have<00:05:28.680> stated<00:05:29.010> though<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:30.000> it

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
they have stated though is that it

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.760 
they have stated though is that it
definitely<00:05:30.720> will<00:05:31.110> not<00:05:31.350> be<00:05:31.530> paid<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.980> win<00:05:32.420> which

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
definitely will not be paid to win which

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.300 
definitely will not be paid to win which
is<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:34.800> good<00:05:34.950> thing<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.160> rightly<00:05:35.790> so<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.530> do<00:05:37.530> my

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
is a good thing and rightly so I do my

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.830 
is a good thing and rightly so I do my
