00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello today we are going to be teaching 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.790
 make a breaded fried chicken that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.519
 when they prepare it and give it to eat at 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.769
 your friends are not going to believe you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 they did it in homes they'll think that what 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.960
 they bought let's see how it looks 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 simple and rich recipes 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.720
 here I am with all the ingredients 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 I want to show you I have 2 pounds of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 chicken 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.390
 we are using hips I think 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 our sites say thigh this is not 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 it's the leg but the hip and we've 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.949
 skin removed this recipe we 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.839
 we always do it without the skin if 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.550
 you want to leave it you can 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.589
 leave I would not know how to tell 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.739
 stay because I've never prepared it like that 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:50.120
 good and it is very simple we will be 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.120
 adding an egg 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.010
 and let's season to taste we will use 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.010
 an envelope of seasoning 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.900
 to the one of a color without tone salt to taste and 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 I 'm going to put a little handful 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.770
 a little more 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.140
 I have garlic powder here 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.860
 and I love 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.350
 and now with our hands simply 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.350
 we mix all this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.090
 well we are already on the stove we have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.440
 here a frying pan with oil we are using 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.720
 corn oil and I want you to see we have 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.480
 flour I have here about a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.910
 cup of flour in this dish we have to 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.070
 hope that our oil is enough 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.940
 hot hot and I want you to 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.940
 see that I have approximately 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.550
 three - quarter inch to one inch 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.319
 depth in the oil 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.769
 and we are going to take our chicken 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.099
 and we're going to bake it well breaded 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.099
 do not 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.620
 while better the spanish better or 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 Take your time and embouch it very 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 all right 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.110
 once ready we go to the oil 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.890
 once you have breaded all those who 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.100
 they will leave approximately two minutes 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.650
 on each side and then they're going to hit 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.040
 after about two minutes to three 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.250
 minutes we start to flip our 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250
 chicken 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.490
 we are at a high medium temperature 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.940
 in these moments I wanted to give you that 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.940
 detail 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.290
 and after turning over we will cover with 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.470
 a lid and let's go down to medium heat 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 low and let's cook for space 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.180
 of a half hour we are covering and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.250
 lowering the temperature the short median 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.190
 because we are going to press approximately 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.330
 Half an hour I'll uncork 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.470
 and now we are going to turn our 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.470
 chicken again 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.780
 and we are going to let cook for space 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.780
 10 to 15 minutes more uncovered 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.770
 so that it lasts better on the other side 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.070
 they were spent about 10-15 minutes I'm going to 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 turn off the fire 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.010
 I want to emphasize that if we were in the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.290
 more or less medium fire in the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.080
 course of this one 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.900
 in this cooking now we are going to remove 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.870
 our chicken and put it to drain in 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.290
 this dish that I already have prepared with 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.290
 paper napkins
