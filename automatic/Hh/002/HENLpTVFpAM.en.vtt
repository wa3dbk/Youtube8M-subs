00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.459
 it began to monitor the river recorded south 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.769
 from the municipality of labranzagrande in 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:19.150
 the department of boyacÃ¡ this having 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.960
 in mind that since previous hours of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.680
 the night 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.609
 I strongly for the top and 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.490
 for he had to flag down the track 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.779
 to precisely alert the 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.779
 communities of the lower parts 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.660
 in the moment at the time you can already give 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.840
 deliver a part of normality having 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.180
 note that the level of the riverbed 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.200
 increased 4 meters 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.460
 the growing already 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.220
 is currently going down 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.430
 you are right 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:03.450
 Effects on crops 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 of all the inhabitants of the village of 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.730
 the sleeve the corner of the sleeve and very 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.750
 surely from the sidewalks 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.270
 new as are chin 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 sant pasqual May 1st 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.740
 but fortunately, thanks to the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.090
 timely support provided by the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.149
 regional broadcasters were able to broadcast 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.960
 messages from very early so that the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.880
 community evacuate and then it was done 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.860
 this from early and there was no need 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.570
 of 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.970
 more actions at this moment we are in 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 normality in advancing before is not 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.160
 raining the river has decreased its flow 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.930
 but obviously we have to be very 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.650
 pending considering that 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.350
 the winter season because apparently it 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.490
 it is coming and it was going to continue raining 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.649
 at least the ideal 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.299
 it tells us that for the weekend 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.960
 we are going to have heavy rains then 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.680
 we have to be vigilant 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 what I say to everyone today is very 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.330
 attentive by the radio media and because 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.810
 unfortunately collapses signal 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.390
 cellular this communication is not possible 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 leave evacuate there is no more them of all 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.350
 modes live and inhabit their place in their 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.380
 housing that is at high risk for 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.450
 flood and then which ones to evacuate to 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 the schools go out to the parties more 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.060
 high to the points with where and to them 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.910
 are they are defined and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.050
 identified that have been identified 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.050
 precisely by themselves
