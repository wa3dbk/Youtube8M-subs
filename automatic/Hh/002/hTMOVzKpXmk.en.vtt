injury prone in the kind of sort of

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.430 
injury prone in the kind of sort of
injuries<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.730> pride<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.120> mean<00:03:40.300> I'm<00:03:40.870> 29<00:03:41.410> now

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
injuries and pride I mean I'm 29 now

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.010 
injuries and pride I mean I'm 29 now
played<00:03:41.860> over<00:03:42.330> 500<00:03:43.330> games<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.750> club<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
played over 500 games with club and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.140 
played over 500 games with club and
country<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.640> says<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.030> all<00:03:46.120> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
country so that's that says it all I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.229 
country so that's that says it all I
think<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.510> injury<00:03:46.810> thing<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> thing<00:03:47.620> that

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
think the injury thing is a thing that

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.520 
think the injury thing is a thing that
gets<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.390> my<00:03:49.510> nose<00:03:49.660> most<00:03:49.959> if<00:03:50.170> I'm<00:03:50.260> honest<00:03:50.500> with
