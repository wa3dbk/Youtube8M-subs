all<00:00:02.310> right<00:00:02.550> my<00:00:03.090> Honda<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.049> it<00:00:04.200> good<00:00:04.830> not<00:00:05.009> too

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
all right my Honda that it good not too

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.009 
all right my Honda that it good not too
long<00:00:05.250> ago<00:00:05.509> and<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:06.870> realized<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.440> well

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
long ago and I just realized that a well

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.450 
long ago and I just realized that a well
well<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.170> friend<00:00:10.380> said<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.860> way<00:00:10.950> down<00:00:11.190> from

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
well my friend said on the way down from

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
well my friend said on the way down from
Pennsylvania<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.150> Texas<00:00:12.799> just<00:00:13.799> once<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.490> took

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Pennsylvania to Texas just once it took

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300 
Pennsylvania to Texas just once it took
really<00:00:15.660> long<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.350> him<00:00:16.440> started<00:00:16.920> he<00:00:17.070> said<00:00:17.220> he

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
really long for him started he said he

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.890 
really long for him started he said he
had<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.430> keep<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.789> cycling<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.420> key<00:00:18.570> on/off

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
had to keep on cycling the key on/off

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.460 
had to keep on cycling the key on/off
and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.800> researched<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.609> uh<00:00:21.260> apparently<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and I researched it and uh apparently a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
and I researched it and uh apparently a
common<00:00:22.680> problem<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:23.160> 94<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> 96<00:00:24.060> Honda's<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
common problem with 94 to 96 Honda's is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.740 
common problem with 94 to 96 Honda's is
a<00:00:24.920> main<00:00:25.920> relay

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
a main relay

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
a main relay
it's<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.930> cover<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:29.960> main<00:00:30.960> relay<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.700> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
it's just cover for main relay it's of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's just cover for main relay it's of
course<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.149> underneath<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:34.010> column<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.130> all

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
course it's underneath a column and all

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
course it's underneath a column and all
that<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> problem<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that but the problem is that on the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.209 
that but the problem is that on the
circuit<00:00:38.129> boards<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.840> sound<00:00:40.079> gets<00:00:40.980> hot<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
circuit boards it sound gets hot the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
circuit boards it sound gets hot the
fuel<00:00:41.550> pump<00:00:41.730> doesn't<00:00:41.879> kick<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.260> because<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
fuel pump doesn't kick on because the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
fuel pump doesn't kick on because the
solder<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> factory<00:00:44.760> they

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
solder on it from the factory they

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.750 
solder on it from the factory they
didn't<00:00:45.239> put<00:00:45.360> enough<00:00:45.390> solder<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.010> when

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
didn't put enough solder on them so when

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.860 
didn't put enough solder on them so when
the<00:00:47.850> circuit<00:00:48.090> board<00:00:48.210> expands<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.780> hot

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the circuit board expands when it's hot

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
the circuit board expands when it's hot
out<00:00:49.079> sometimes<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> solder<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:50.910> separate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
out sometimes the solder would separate

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.810 
out sometimes the solder would separate
and<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> wouldn't<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> good<00:00:52.230> connection

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
and it wouldn't get a good connection

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
and it wouldn't get a good connection
now<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> shitty<00:00:54.840> job<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:56.600> restarted<00:00:57.600> all

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
now I did a shitty job I restarted all

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
now I did a shitty job I restarted all
of<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.969> they<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.239> reason

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of them so now there they look at reason

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.969 
of them so now there they look at reason
I<00:01:00.780> guess<00:01:01.789> what<00:01:02.789> they<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.920> going<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
I guess what they are but going to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.240 
I guess what they are but going to
reconnect<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.140> see<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:08.010> sure<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
reconnect it and see that make sure it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
reconnect it and see that make sure it
starts<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.840> should<00:01:09.900> start<00:01:10.260> no

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
starts on all that it should start no

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
starts on all that it should start no
problem<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> bear<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.799> me<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
problem now so bear with me for we

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
problem now so bear with me for we
connect<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:19.939> first<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.270> must<00:01:22.400> cover

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.650 

so<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> way<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.190> short<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.300> on<00:01:30.450> any

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
so that way I don't short it out on any

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.080 
so that way I don't short it out on any
metal<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.080> there<00:01:33.230> that<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:38.070> hard<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.730> see<00:01:38.970> up

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
metal up there that it's hard to see up

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.590 
metal up there that it's hard to see up
here<00:01:39.650> here's<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.830> connector<00:01:41.190> right<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.600> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
here here's the connector right here it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.680 
here here's the connector right here it
mounts<00:01:43.430> way<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.850> you'll<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
mounts way up in there you'll see it

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.150 
mounts way up in there you'll see it
it's<00:01:45.870> unlike<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.370> metal<00:01:47.420> slide<00:01:48.420> connector<00:01:49.160> it's

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
it's unlike a metal slide connector it's

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's unlike a metal slide connector it's
not<00:01:50.340> too<00:01:50.550> hard<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> though<00:01:51.590> as<00:01:52.590> long<00:01:52.650> as

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
not too hard to get to though as long as

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.050 
not too hard to get to though as long as
you're<00:01:53.070> limber<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.520> me<00:01:53.730> but<00:01:59.060> very

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you're limber like me but very

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.860 
you're limber like me but very
connecting<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.050> hand<00:02:01.080> or<00:02:01.560> not

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
connecting this with one hand or not

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.410 
connecting this with one hand or not
yeah<00:02:03.870> go<00:02:04.970> tuck<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.450> way<00:02:06.600> just

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
yeah go tuck it up out of the way just

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:18.949 
yeah go tuck it up out of the way just
sew<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:16.220> up<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.580> reach<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> clutch

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
sew this up so I can reach the clutch

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:37.120 
sew this up so I can reach the clutch
pedal<00:02:23.870> cheap<00:02:24.870> phone<00:02:25.160> keys<00:02:26.160> keys<00:02:26.400> key<00:02:34.850> right<00:02:35.850> up

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
pedal cheap phone keys keys key right up

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.710 
pedal cheap phone keys keys key right up
before<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:38.459> hot<00:02:39.150> days<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.330> today<00:02:39.600> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
before I have two hot days like today I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.220 
before I have two hot days like today I
have<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.050> keep<00:02:40.650> trying

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.710 

but<00:02:46.800> yeah<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.129> have<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> 94<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> 96<00:02:48.330> Honda

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
but yeah if you have a 94 to 96 Honda

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600 
but yeah if you have a 94 to 96 Honda
mines<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.319> accord<00:02:49.680> by<00:02:49.920> hearing<00:02:50.160> problem

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
mines in accord by hearing problem

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.520 
mines in accord by hearing problem
problems<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.860> Integra's<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.580> civics

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
problems on the Integra's the civics

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
problems on the Integra's the civics
pretty<00:02:55.530> much<00:02:55.680> all<00:02:55.800> all<00:02:56.099> The<00:02:56.220> Hondas<00:02:56.370> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
pretty much all all The Hondas and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.320 
pretty much all all The Hondas and
Acuras<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.629> they<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.959> same<00:02:58.200> relay

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
Acuras because they have that same relay
