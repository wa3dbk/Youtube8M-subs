00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:07.526
 With the point of arrangement of the material with scenario editor 

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:12.260
 I will explain the concept of "VTS" and so on. 

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:21.037
 Keep in mind that as it becomes a large-scale work or a complex work, it will be particularly important to explain from now on. 

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:27.121
 In DVD, "VTS" is one basic unit. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
 In one VTS 

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:32.136
 One menu domain per language 

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:38.313
 And it consists of at least one or more title domains. 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.886
 At least one PGC in the title 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.969
 Under PGC, "Program" and "Cell" are configured. 

00:00:52.616 --> 00:01:00.000
 In terms of numbers, VTS, and titles, up to 99 across the disc 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.545
 PGC has 65,535 throughout the title of one VTS 

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:14.908
 You can also use up to 65,535 in the menu domain. 

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:21.456
 About 99 programs in one PGC 

00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:27.446
 In addition, 255 cells in one PGC 

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:31.672
 Also, for “PTT”, which is a chapter, 

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:38.638
 Up to 999 can be used throughout the title in one VTS. 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.750
 Also, throughout the title in one VTS, 

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:49.600
 MPEG type, MPEG1 or MPEG2 or Aspect Ratio (Aspect Lisio) 

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.620
 Also, the language configuration of the stream 

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:59.070
 This is the configuration of Japanese, English, etc. 

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.930
 This is for subtitles, audio, etc. 

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:07.520
 Only common things can be placed at the same time. 

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:15.190
 A mixture of 16: 9 and 4: 3 throughout a single VTS title or 

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.160
 Also about the track 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.850
 Subtitle and audio language settings 

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:24.570
 The first track is Japanese and the second track is English 

00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:31.120
 The first is English, the second is Japanese, and so on. 

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.480
 And for the audio stream 

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:37.200
 The first track is "PCM" and the second track is "AC3" 

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.240
 The first track is "AC3" and the second track is "PCM" 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.210
 In addition, with the AC3 track of 2 channels both 1st and 2nd 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.480
 It is not possible to mix tracks with AC3 in the first channel with two channels and the second channel with 5.1 channels. 

00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:21.460
 In addition, it is unit of VTS that can share material without increasing capacity 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.820
 Press Sort Tracks in the upper right and look at the capacity 

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:34.970
 In the lower left, it is out that 34% 1.40GB is in use. 

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:43.330
 Then try to place the same video again on different titles in the same VTS. 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.400
 Let's check the capacity with Sort Tracks again. 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:04.270
 At this time, the capacity does not change, and it is indicated that 34% 1.40 GB of use is used. 

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:12.960
 Let's adapt the same video to titles in different VTS. 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.880
 Then the (capacity) consumption rate of the whole work is 

00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:27.860
 You can see that it has doubled to 68% 2.77GB. 

00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:37.150
 In this way, if you want to share material, keep it in the VTS. 

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:46.910
 Also, I think you may want to use the video menu or place the video in the menu domain. 

00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:52.800
 You can place in the menu domain only about 1GB of data in total. 

00:04:54.708 --> 00:05:01.810
 By knowing all these limitations, I think you will be able to do this while thinking about the placement of the material.
