00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.410
 sometimes I want to see it's a tactician 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.840
 but still just huge 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.730
 the most interesting is this here 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.610
 so we come to a configuration where 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.829
 a little cooperation is going on I believe 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.119
 a big phone 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.800
 then it is certainly not the most fashionable 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.360
 phones that you've seen but he 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.340
 has the merit of soon in our hands and 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.579
 to be rather practical at the level 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:42.880
 of use if coming 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.880
 it would be nice if yuma fargo yes we have 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.940
 played some time for us if 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:55.460
 English here is anyway a phone 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.230
 and if we will come a Greek default 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.700
 sided shot at the same time it's not so 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.960
 actually holds if you play sports 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.000
 but no need for more than one thing 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.489
 super amazing on the phone who 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.020
 works pretty well here but it's 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.260
 nor is it really a 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 smartphone is for you a phone 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.820
 1 32 10 33 10 after interest structures 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.800
 banking yes here's that you're a 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.910
 little more you'll be able to put it a 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.910
 little bit of time like this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.360
 relive the match in this case a robbery 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.650
 rather nice 36 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.650
 it's cholera 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.329
 aj cook have traveled seven cameras 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.040
 he was not fined 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.120
 the camera in fact putting the button 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 to do something a little fast 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.210
 if it is to settle here we have a small 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.210
 sheep 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 labeaume after 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.780
 not live it's amazing but who 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.849
 can do the job 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.989
 if you fall beyond age if the fiber 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.400
 the brand 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.659
 we will leave them a billion 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 moderate andrassy tours view 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.819
 possibly not to be interesting 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.879
 here besides the flat host that is 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.379
 cool if you ever can you can 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.030
 have fun the blow the taxes to 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.030
 defend certainly but sympathetic
