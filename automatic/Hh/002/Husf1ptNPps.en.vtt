00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and then I can always go back and grab

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.560 
and then I can always go back and grab
more<00:02:15.870> green<00:02:16.170> blot<00:02:17.130> again<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:17.910> start<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
more green blot again and then start and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.010 
more green blot again and then start and
get<00:02:19.260> more<00:02:19.470> concentrated<00:02:20.250> into<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.790> sides<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
get more concentrated into the sides and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
get more concentrated into the sides and
it's<00:02:22.590> sort<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.950> neat<00:02:23.190> way<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.520> sort<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.210> blend

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
it's sort of a neat way to sort of blend

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
it's sort of a neat way to sort of blend
two<00:02:24.720> colors<00:02:25.050> together<00:02:25.200> while<00:02:25.860> creating

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
two colors together while creating

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280 
two colors together while creating
really<00:02:26.700> neat<00:02:26.880> texture<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.570> your<00:02:27.600> piece<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
really neat texture on your piece and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.640 
really neat texture on your piece and
that's<00:02:28.890> how<00:02:29.130> we<00:02:29.190> sponge
