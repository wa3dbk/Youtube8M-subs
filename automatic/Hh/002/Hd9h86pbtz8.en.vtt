00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Welcome to the xtreme xp speaker 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.010
 here on another tv with one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.690
 integrated battery also still the 2002 the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.590
 has traffic lights and then your device too 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.630
 can charge 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 we are safe with the ipad 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.630
 will work on the back 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.850
 not mentioned in the manual but directly 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 itself is already nice on the device 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 it is a simple design 2010 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 Milliampere is not too big and has 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.269
 really a good sound as well 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.859
 Immediately hear if I with the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.720
 one are three compare the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.740
 internal speakers and the normal 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 speakers but I think above all 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.830
 the packaging is already 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 high quality and up here you can see 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 There is always this beautiful effect here 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.320
 that sandra is not just that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.820
 charger is also one more 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 speakers and now pack the whole thing 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.719
 times from cost around 30 euros 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 mobile.de or turkey or mobile.de 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.879
 there it can buy and yes we see 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 We can have a fancy design like this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.640
 I'll be mentioned earlier 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 Of course, the complete unpacking is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.199
 not too much in the packaging in it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 a guide a cable and the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.680
 device itself and the instructions 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 but important for the first time 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.049
 if it will be used you wonder 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.339
 why is not possible right away 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.229
 will work so i could go on 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
 In any case, we have a usb cable 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.470
 to usb so she should not on any 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.890
 You do not lose this case 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.630
 lots 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 that's because they 're there directly 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.290
 Of course you can load with yours 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.790
 standard usb charger and then have 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 Here we have the guide which it too 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.869
 important because we already have to mention it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.799
 of course, know what led to what 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.900
 time or 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.610
 how fast your music is played 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.890
 on the other side is the whole up 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.500
 Chinese but in English if you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 understand that already then we have 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.310
 here once the speakers themselves the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.409
 you can just take out and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 then you really see a chic here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 Aluminum design not too heavy 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 it also feels quite stable here 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
 are the speakers and on the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.399
 the other side we find nothing except 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.329
 a white surface 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.520
 but what can we do here? 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.750
 pull it out and turn it over 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 you see here we have the three and a half 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.869
 millimeter connection of non-gold plated 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.570
 here is the muscle connection to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.490
 charge and to the natural stream 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.259
 spend and below we still have the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 bass that fits hole or that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.850
 hole where then goes in here if you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.130
 according to this, it protects with it 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.420
 is and it can be really nice 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.890
 here wonderful in the jacket pocket 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.849
 I would take it with me in my pants pocket 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.979
 but not necessarily 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.150
 because that's too big once you get it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.830
 has worked well, nothing has happened yet 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
 that fits now says nothing about it 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.270
 that there is a gta status leds three pieces 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.069
 once here, for that we know 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.400
 not only is there still each 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.800
 step by 33% and a blue leds 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.300
 indicates whether the device is on or off and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.170
 yes then we can, for example, just 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.500
 insert our USB cable and then eg 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.310
 my samsung the 634 invite 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 That should not be a problem 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.300
 you do not have to push anything but it will 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500
 then immediately loaded the display will be on 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.140
 and that is not a problem 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.400
 then, however, is also the led here 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.710
 on the device and shows us that it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.780
 two white ones are still there 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.610
 about what a lot 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.960
 It is not necessary to find a more practical way 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.860
 necessarily to load use as already 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.270
 mentioned but can also as 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.040
 So I can use musicplayer here 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.290
 take this three millimeter connection 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.330
 all here tuck the whole 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.980
 formulated directly as a stand so also 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.810
 You can put it that way on the table 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.610
 make feel very stable and 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.110
 It's not just a position 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.840
 Do it here but you really can 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.940
 turn it almost stepless 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.810
 So I'm no grades you can 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.100
 it really in the appropriate 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.570
 position in the man wants to pay 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.860
 Now it's on again 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.740
 and then I play you a bit 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.610
 music from which I now want to have also 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.610
 played 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.989
 and that sounds mostly you can 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.110
 bad, however, are three seconds 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.189
 until the s3 detects or until 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.290
 the boxes realize that there is something 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.610
 connected is why plays the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.409
 music was already heard from but nothing 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.579
 what helps a bit is you again 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.549
 Pull off and again turn when stuck 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.019
 more than three seconds pass 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.970
 and that makes the show effect now 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.260
 the device is not yet on 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.970
 Of course you will always see that beautiful 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.620
 with the leds from now all or nothing 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.170
 but of course you can, of course 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.150
 play music and meanwhile that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.310
 charging device it works at the same time 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.430
 very well 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.030
 and yes so apparently at just 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.420
 finally, though already more than five 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.349
 seconds have passed, of course 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.659
 At least that's how I see the music 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.060
 also plays the loudness it on the 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.320
 maximum that's why I'm stuck now 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.580
 of course, it's over now 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.470
 stupid if it does not work then 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.030
 but also notices that it is not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.229
 I'm always perfect too 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.820
 already connected so i know that 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.949
 it works I have it full too 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.940
 the iphone ever made and 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.169
 because they do not know why 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.150
 does not want to work 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.050
 I try sms with the iphone and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 maybe it works in English 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.910
 video then just better so the iphone 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.500
 Be careful that no height necessarily 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.039
 that's why the whole thing is important 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.650
 it's pure iphone is natural 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.639
 log in and now we press on play 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.020
 and since no good but definitely passe 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.060
 see case with the iphone works that 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.990
 Again, wonderful with the stand and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.280
 of course now dumb if not at all 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.810
 music is played more I know 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.430
 every case that electricity will be spent 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.760
 can and we will try it best 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.289
 the same again with the ipad whether with 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.639
 to spend the electricity works in 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.639
 the description is actually in it 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.180
 and it just does not work because 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.750
 I have the chic battery already 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.950
 broken or simply 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.550
 overused knows all the time 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.960
 other thing I tried it on 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.090
 definitely just once with the ipad yet 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.760
 times we show once again that it here 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.020
 simply can close meanwhile 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.610
 take the ipad and there it can 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.610
 infect that with the ipad is natural 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:46.270
 also wonderful at the corner time 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.270
 get infected here, that even works 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.690
 G20 very pure but I'll try it now 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.690
 just something happened 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.700
 apparently nothing music plays out 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.110
 The device does not light up so I say 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.120
 times so extreme is unreliable 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.920
 out of sight now and I would 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.030
 Not necessarily a buy recommendation instead 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.890
 now for mobile even if it drives 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.500
 I just worked it out earlier 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.390
 time to test the ipad whether the music or 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.050
 or if the battery at least then loaded 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.490
 You can do that with 2200 milliamps though 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.310
 it does not seem to help 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.000
 now what many on and stake out 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.080
 Take a look at it 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.340
 English video on I will not now 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.880
 further do not try us in the long run 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.300
 to draw 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.920
 I'm only doing the short here 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:39.640
 charge test because there are 600 billion 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:43.580
 euro that's what I mean again quickly 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.150
 turn here she is on strike at 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.150
 ipad on 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.240
 and 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.330
 nothing happens at the leds and at the 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.950
 ipad is also not doing anything so it will 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.600
 not loaded the ipad is on none 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.240
 case capable of charging the 68 billion 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.870
 By no means are the iPad enough 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.940
 want more then 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.280
 and yes fingering on gravel at apple tv 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.820
 that was the extreme mix power in here 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.740
 short test and unboxing unfortunately not 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.910
 succeeded you look the English too 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.690
 again maybe it works better there 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.890
 Until next time 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.890
 have watched finances
