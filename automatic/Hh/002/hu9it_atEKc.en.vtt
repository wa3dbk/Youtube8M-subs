OtterBox Commuter so it's a two-part
case<00:00:15.870> system<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> soft<00:00:18.960> inner<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
case system that has a soft inner and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.009 
case system that has a soft inner and
then<00:00:20.490> also<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.990> hard<00:00:21.990> outer<00:00:22.350> backing<00:00:23.570> as<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
then also a hard outer backing as you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.750 
then also a hard outer backing as you
can<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> difficulty

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
can see a little bit of difficulty

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.769 
can see a little bit of difficulty
actually<00:00:27.449> pulling<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.900> apart<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:30.420> means

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
actually pulling it apart but that means

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.139 
actually pulling it apart but that means
that<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.170> will<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.650> fall<00:00:31.920> apart<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> hits

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that this will not fall apart if it hits

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
that this will not fall apart if it hits
the<00:00:33.300> ground<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> once<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.920> apart

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370

see again a little bit of difficulty
applying<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.300> try<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.600> way

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
applying so maybe we'll try this way
