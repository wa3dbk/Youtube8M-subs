00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:09.919
 in petersburg nobody doubted that 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.400
 sunday visit to the team were very 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.839
 want doubt I too have been brought in 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.269
 government 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.519
 but in general there is never doubt we 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.449
 we quit to win 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.829
 yes of course we can lose but we are not up 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.480
 the end of the year to try how would we 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.339
 use 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.119
 chances and his average militia 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.449
 but this reality was not a cat 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.789
 slackness because pretty 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.400
 long failed to clogged towel 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.100
 confidence it gives strength and in 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 principle Yaroslav Nikitenko it was not and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670
 it's good that everything is good 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.360
 the percentage has long failed to recruit 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900
 Points you got a prize today Serbian 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.920
 it turned out hot 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 the fact is that just a long time did not play and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.070
 there was of course a point 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.540
 such more former partners of creation 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.190
 but just the reality 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.600
 worked in this death a little bit and she 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 partner did everything 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110
 But in general, Spartak surprised than anything 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.440
 arbitrary details 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.030
 thoughts prince pedro ie to this team and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 from watched her play 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 in principle, inan trainer valeriya that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.450
 won't do to her 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.800
 we are in principle and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.070
 waited for this and we waited for her to be 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.350
 play back and so 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.000
 The percentage for St. Petersburg is clear 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 that this is very important to you 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 as one of the few for 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.219
 Petersburgers team 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.070
 only here is a special match 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.970
 in fact every match is important especially 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.960
 home 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.150
 we always want to win at home 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.750
 Arena to surprise fans 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.830
 please them her therefore 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.820
 I would not say that this is some kind of special 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.170
 match it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 just matches that needed to be won 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.260
 which we were obliged to win 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.170
 ska already for several matches 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.830
 Moscow Dynamo opened in a row 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.380
 fight for leadership in the division getting 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 becoming what we win they 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.250
 win we lose they too 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.980
 lose 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.300
 in communication and this is the first place 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.290
 in the division on fundamentally 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.500
 I would certainly be the first 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.690
 I would like to now everywhere 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.370
 but he basically thought everything now 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.039
 team and do not give this st 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.320
 what are you looking at her attention 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.809
 does not highlight 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.859
 but because the championship is long 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 may change 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.769
 at the region of basil you were asked how 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.310
 you will be once a day and instead of Peter prus 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.030
 Now you can specifically respond to 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.989
 This question I basically could then 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.379
 answer this question because 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.650
 I know that these good partners are what they are 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.289
 principle in all support 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.609
 they tell me what to do there 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 field 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.760
 basically take off the rub 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.370
 it's very easy to play with them 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.239
 because 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.399
 her pastor 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.620
 everything is easy and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.249
 all is well
