00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 hey people here and welcome to one 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.429
 new video in the video today I will 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.469
 imagine the ripper 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 the new tsi weapon already the season 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 pass users have gotten a little bit of him 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 shooting does not suit you and the weapon 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 you want to play then you have to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.830
 the second animal you buy so 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 apart from the small ones, of course 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 micro daisies the second big mappack 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.560
 since we have the weapon then 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 I think that's a very good one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
 step by infinity was because of black 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 Unfortunately, we had only one ops 2 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 weapon and now it looks like it would 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 We really do each one of them a new one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.200
 get a weapon 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 many may want to go now 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 know if the weapon oberbauer that because 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 Maybe you with a strong game 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.100
 and not bad weapon now 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 want to hear and I can you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 assure the weapon very very strong and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 I would even be in the top three 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.120
 sets the top three weapons but it is 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.910
 also no link oberbauer that is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 It can definitely be different from others 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 weapons in the categories such as the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.100
 struck in the smt category 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.869
 become 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 The cool thing about the weapon is everyone 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.760
 case it's a s p &amp; r hybrid 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.310
 that means both machine gun as 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.259
 also assault rifle and the whole is not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 too stupidly implemented as in modern warfare 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.220
 3 or black ops 2 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.049
 that there are a lot of animals working around 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 and that takes a long time but 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.909
 the whole is very very futuristic and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 the visor just goes up and you 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.180
 can also be like right now in the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.750
 background just keep moving 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.850
 shoot 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.650
 This is very fast and hindered 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.270
 no case what I in the video 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.310
 wants to do mainly through the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 differences show between smg version 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 and assault rifle, ie assault rifle 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 version there are some 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.479
 Differences but I can ever 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 start with the damage and that is up 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.710
 both weapons equal and that is how they are 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.840
 three to five shots so that is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.060
 medium damage for a sng and on 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
 a r as nothing great now 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 special but again very much 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.750
 good at the weapon stopped with two to three 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 shots in the head that means she is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 A very good weapon when you're on 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.509
 she can pull her head 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.729
 probably a 15 hatchet 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
 multiplier that means you participate 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.550
 a bullet on the breast 100% 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.300
 hurt as always below 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.350
 a bullet on the head but even 150 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.820
 and that's really very much 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.280
 strong there are many weapons that have 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.490
 no multiplier and some 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.110
 weapons that have to 125 now we come 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.390
 to the range and that is at the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.450
 submachine gun on average and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 but in the eifel it is twice as 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.990
 That is when you open the visor 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.360
 Do you have a double range 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.980
 and that means you turn on one 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 more distance still the same 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.070
 damage and the damage will not 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.480
 less and think now 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.520
 maybe some of you then why 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.060
 Should I ever go with the smc visier 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.220
 play 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.780
 only good that also has an advantage 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.520
 if you are using the smp with the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.890
 machine pistols as it has played here 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.560
 yes, a higher fire rate and that around 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.660
 some that is the smt fire rate is 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.030
 even very good under the smb and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.430
 that's up to them and where he is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.260
 that's even with the other three 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.880
 Comparison with the other storm rifles 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.740
 very very slowly 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.360
 the disadvantage of then again with the 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 Machine gun is coming that's you more 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.690
 recoil has but I play the weapon 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.400
 always with the handle of the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.080
 recoil is generally difficult too 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.220
 because he does not control now 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.050
 somehow controllable in one 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.510
 Direction is like many weapons 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.850
 but really is random and always in 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.739
 other directions blow up now 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.270
 Two more things are very important 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.130
 you have to pay attention 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.660
 and that on the one hand, that's her 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.209
 if you play with the weapon with the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.800
 ripper that you then speed the movement 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.230
 So the speed with you 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.910
 moved by a sch 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.160
 that means you are moving very much 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.380
 fast even if you are in the storm 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.880
 uterus since there are still two 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.410
 very important things he necessarily 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.690
 pay attention and that on the one hand 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.340
 if you play with the knight then have 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.720
 her the movement speed of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.190
 a submachine gun 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.770
 that means you are very fast 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.260
 on the way, even if you have the assault rifle 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.640
 we have the second one up here very much 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.620
 important tip is also if you that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.630
 storm gun from it makes so far 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.700
 from the assault rifle you can like one 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.709
 machine pistol from the hip celebrate 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.750
 that means in close combat you can calm 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.880
 even with the assault rifle easy 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.540
 talk around and you become pretty 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.370
 to be precise 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.410
 that was just like that 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.790
 basic information and her 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.680
 you'll probably be amazed now 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.210
 because it is so very many 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.080
 differences between the two versions 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.449
 gives 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.699
 that depends on whether this little one is up 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.780
 up here or down is if you 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 maybe even a whole 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.560
 class leader video about this weapon 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.180
 about the ripper then want to write 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.069
 me in the comments or goes to the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.110
 video just a thumbs up 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.460
 thanks for the many support at the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.560
 her last videos are just missing her 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.719
 best and that's why the next one is coming 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.189
 days synonymous really many videos for 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.479
 More videos subscribed in any case 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.280
 the channel and if I do that again 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.080
 liked and wanted to support me 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.509
 then it would be really nice if you give me one 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.219
 positive rating because that leaves something of 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.419
 I thank you for seeing and 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.440
 wish you all one more 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.120
 wonderful day 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.340
 I would I see you the same 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.330
 tomorrow always in the next video how three 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.330
 people piesau
