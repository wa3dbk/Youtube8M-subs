today we've got the HOA whose control
solenoid<00:00:12.500> it's<00:00:13.400> got<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.519> package<00:00:13.879> right<00:00:14.030> here

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
solenoid it's got a package right here

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.189 
solenoid it's got a package right here
let's<00:00:14.660> go<00:00:14.750> ahead<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:15.049> open<00:00:15.080> this<00:00:15.290> up<00:00:17.199> alright

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
let's go ahead and open this up alright

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.269 
let's go ahead and open this up alright
so<00:00:18.260> I'm<00:00:18.320> just<00:00:18.439> gonna<00:00:18.529> pull<00:00:18.830> out<00:00:18.949> everything

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
so I'm just gonna pull out everything

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.839 
so I'm just gonna pull out everything
that's<00:00:19.550> included<00:00:20.119> in<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:20.420> fit<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:22.130> this<00:00:22.670> one

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
that's included in this fit and this one

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.660 
that's included in this fit and this one
will<00:00:23.000> be<00:00:23.029> specific<00:00:23.810> for<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.199> o2<00:00:24.650> plus<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.250> WRX

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
will be specific for the o2 plus and WRX

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.599 
will be specific for the o2 plus and WRX
and<00:00:25.789> STI<00:00:26.109> now<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:27.170> reason<00:00:27.560> why<00:00:27.740> it'll<00:00:28.310> work<00:00:28.460> on

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
and STI now the reason why it'll work on

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.189 
and STI now the reason why it'll work on
all<00:00:28.880> those<00:00:29.000> models<00:00:29.480> basically<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.080> only

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
all those models basically the only

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.480 
all those models basically the only
difference<00:00:30.650> between<00:00:30.800> them<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.220> just<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
difference between them is just the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.950 
difference between them is just the
mounting<00:00:31.789> bracket<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.540> is<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:32.780> going

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
mounting bracket so this is just going

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.530 
mounting bracket so this is just going
to<00:00:33.020> come<00:00:33.200> with<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.560> universal<00:00:34.190> bracket<00:00:34.580> this

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
to come with the universal bracket this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.000 
to come with the universal bracket this
will<00:00:35.750> actually<00:00:35.840> bolt<00:00:36.230> right<00:00:36.470> up<00:00:36.530> just<00:00:36.920> like

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
will actually bolt right up just like

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.640 
will actually bolt right up just like
stock<00:00:37.340> for<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.730> o2<00:00:38.120> 207<00:00:38.810> but<00:00:38.990> the<00:00:39.080> O<00:00:39.110> 8<00:00:39.320> plus

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
stock for the o2 207 but the O 8 plus

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.790 
stock for the o2 207 but the O 8 plus
you<00:00:40.220> will<00:00:40.490> have<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:41.080> come<00:00:42.080> up<00:00:42.110> with<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.410> mounting

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
you will have to come up with a mounting

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440 
you will have to come up with a mounting
solution<00:00:43.370> for<00:00:43.580> that<00:00:43.760> although<00:00:43.910> it's<00:00:44.270> being

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
solution for that although it's being

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.410 
solution for that although it's being
easy<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.870> make<00:00:44.990> it<00:00:45.110> clean<00:00:45.290> because<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.950> that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
easy to make it clean because of that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.910 
easy to make it clean because of that
bracket<00:00:47.420> right<00:00:47.810> there<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:48.260> should<00:00:48.530> bolt<00:00:48.740> up

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
bracket right there so should bolt up

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.400 
bracket right there so should bolt up
just<00:00:49.490> like<00:00:49.640> stock<00:00:49.970> now<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.990> nice<00:00:51.170> thing<00:00:51.350> about

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
just like stock now the nice thing about

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.500 
just like stock now the nice thing about
is<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.800> comes<00:00:51.920> with<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.160> plug-and-play<00:00:52.610> harness

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
is it comes with a plug-and-play harness

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.720 
is it comes with a plug-and-play harness
you<00:00:53.840> can<00:00:53.900> see<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.320> here<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:55.130> so<00:00:55.340> basically

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
you can see that here and so basically

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.350 
you can see that here and so basically
that<00:00:56.980> goes<00:00:57.980> in<00:00:58.160> here<00:00:58.430> like<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:01.060> that's<00:01:02.060> and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
that goes in here like so that's and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.790 
that goes in here like so that's and
that<00:01:02.390> plugs<00:01:02.690> into<00:01:02.840> your<00:01:02.990> factory<00:01:03.350> harness<00:01:03.560> to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
that plugs into your factory harness to

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320 
that plugs into your factory harness to
make<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.950> hundred<00:01:04.309> percent<00:01:04.370> plug-and-play

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
make a hundred percent plug-and-play

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.510 
make a hundred percent plug-and-play
but<00:01:06.170> being<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.440> this<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:06.890> an<00:01:07.040> aftermarket

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
but being that this is an aftermarket

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.790 
but being that this is an aftermarket
boost<00:01:08.210> control<00:01:08.540> solenoid<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.080> will<00:01:09.350> require

install very easy using it's just a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.180 
install very easy using it's just a
great<00:01:26.090> solenoid<00:01:26.630> all<00:01:26.810> around<00:01:27.110> now<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.010> course

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
great solenoid all around now of course

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.090 
great solenoid all around now of course
the<00:01:28.460> literature<00:01:29.060> comes<00:01:29.330> with<00:01:29.830> basically<00:01:30.830> just

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the literature comes with basically just

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.340 
the literature comes with basically just
shows<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.550> solenoid<00:01:32.000> itself<00:01:32.360> at<00:01:32.990> going<00:01:33.320> to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
shows the solenoid itself at going to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.200 
shows the solenoid itself at going to
the<00:01:33.530> intake<00:01:33.830> not<00:01:34.490> going<00:01:34.730> to<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.880> waste<00:01:35.030> gate

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
the intake not going to the waste gate

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.750 
the intake not going to the waste gate
and<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.510> going<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.840> compressor<00:01:36.260> pretty<00:01:36.530> easy

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
and that going to compressor pretty easy

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.610 
and that going to compressor pretty easy
hooks<00:01:37.760> up<00:01:37.940> you<00:01:38.120> know<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.600> like<00:01:38.750> stock<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.530> of

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
hooks up you know just like stock and of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.780 
hooks up you know just like stock and of
course<00:01:39.890> being<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:40.310> comes<00:01:40.460> with<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
course being that it comes with the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.120 
course being that it comes with the
plug-and-play<00:01:41.090> harness<00:01:41.659> it'll<00:01:42.560> install<00:01:42.860> just

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
plug-and-play harness it'll install just

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.250 
plug-and-play harness it'll install just
like<00:01:43.250> stock<00:01:43.580> as<00:01:43.760> well<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.360> basically<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
like stock as well and basically the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.469 
like stock as well and basically the
advantage<00:01:45.650> of<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:47.210> know<00:01:47.300> the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
advantage of this is you know the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.290 
advantage of this is you know the
ability<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:47.930> fold<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.890> lot<00:01:49.130> more<00:01:49.400> booze<00:01:49.670> and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
ability to fold a lot more booze and
