00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
not going to be enough to counteract it

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.650 
not going to be enough to counteract it
and<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:05.640> when<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.850> ordered<00:04:06.269> my<00:04:06.390> troops

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
and targeted with his unicorn caused me

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.520 
and targeted with his unicorn caused me
a<00:04:16.410> little<00:04:16.590> bit<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.889> damage

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530
