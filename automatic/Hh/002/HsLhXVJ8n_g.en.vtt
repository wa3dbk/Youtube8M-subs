00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.640
 here is a police station or something 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.880
 The following branches will tighten here. 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.900
 Quickly, it 's a police officer, I do not know. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.580

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.710
 Then you have to press a key. 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 He 'll ask you, you'll have to think. 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.930
 continuing with her friends now he 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.310

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:49.760

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.090

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.610
 end of career beauty we are here in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.590

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.990
 there knowing that I'm with this strong for 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.350
 It's really the box here, I can eat one. 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.260

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:11.570
 You see that business up there is that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.240
 It's for you, it 's a game, I do not know. 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.540
 that's it the port opened today well then 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:35.770
 This is for finishing and I remember that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.900
 There has to be a place where they 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.390
 hide your weapons take place here 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 and judges will be able to seek 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.260
 so if that 's the video did not stay for 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.260
 on here 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.210
 so this is it so this is having a place 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.550
 there on the disk as I showed you 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.470
 I have the right place that they lost. 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.170
 your weapons now have a place 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.950
 now I do not know where a door is and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.630
 chose if you liked this string 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.730

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.760

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.310
 It really matters that you have to 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.910
 keep worth saving 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.910
