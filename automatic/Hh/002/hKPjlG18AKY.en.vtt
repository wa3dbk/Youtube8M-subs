 Naruto 793 a 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.930
 Curry garnish 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 His channel has now stopped 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:24.890
 Yes Well this is it maybe 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:30.769
 Report or police contact youtube on youtube 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.910
 While the company itself has erased that channel maybe that that Well Well from that of the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.910
 Whether the listener has gone or youtube has gone for it 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.590
 Surely it will not be erased by himself 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.650
 U 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:48.250
 It becomes quite a topic now, though 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:51.460
 I wonder what will happen to the TV, but it also flows quite well 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.690
 Another Well Nde are also quite flow in I heard the net 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 Reinforced around the and maybe get caught I'm I'm 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.420
 U 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.399
 Oh dear 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.330
 I saw a lot of his sound videos I also had about 8 channels 3 I think about money 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.560
 If the channel 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.409
 Even if there are three channels he has launched , it's Miyako at all 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.800
 I saw it, but just before the channel was turned off 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.160
 One end to this and I new that went up videos only for a moment 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.960
 I say to the store that I made a mischief of the product of the mischief store 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:30.350
 The third of it is this time of the video was the video certainly'm shy come also potatoes but is Rikonan 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.440
 I would like the 1 yen coin that I had for this salad taste. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:41.010
 I put a hole and put it in from the top 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:45.180
 Ne subjected to Well fire Kedomo I malicious are saying Well Well vicious that I that 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.390
 It's the opposite , I think youtube is a fake tree reverse 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:55.210
 Because I posted the video on youtube because he posted the video on youtube 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.930
 You may not understand this crime just because you posted 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.430
 The person in the shop looks at it and reports it, and the person in the shop is finally 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.409
 Did not you understand that it had been put in that toothpick in potato ? 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.009
 So channel-by-channel Nike of I think youtube 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.750
 I think it was good not to be honest If you really want to catch 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.310
 In he is not probably not be doing Toka twitter the minute you money Toka also have so much 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.150
 Maybe not 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.150
 I think that you will get caught soon if you look at a certain youtube video . 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.620
 So I think I wasn't very good at killing his channel 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.810
 More empty 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.800
 Ne 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:39.720
 It might have become a clue for a while 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.820
 I think it's really wasteful if you turn off some channels 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:50.700
 It means that his channel has disappeared by the fact that 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:55.080
 Everyone is quite natural but it is natural as a human but watching that video 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 Please do not imitate the fun just because 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.710
 Yes then it was a show of minutes 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.130
 k I want Sato 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.130
 I dropped it
