00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
speed everything up a little bit because

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.720 
speed everything up a little bit because
otherwise<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.340> takes<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.940> long<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.599> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
yeah so i bought them so obviously the

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.680 
yeah so i bought them so obviously the
profit<00:03:34.950> isn't<00:03:35.099> going<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.549> as<00:03:35.730> good<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.419> i

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
profit isn't going to be as good but i

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.890 
profit isn't going to be as good but i
can<00:03:37.349> make<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.739> lot<00:03:37.950> more<00:03:38.010> faster<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.389> it's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
can make a lot more faster so it's

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.569 
can make a lot more faster so it's
pretty<00:03:40.079> much<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.349> same<00:03:40.859> thing<00:03:40.919> either<00:03:41.310> way<00:03:41.549> i

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
pretty much the same thing either way i

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.400 
pretty much the same thing either way i

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
then boom there you go and also a little

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.189 
then boom there you go and also a little
tip<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.070> if<00:04:17.370> two<00:04:17.789> items<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.389> in<00:04:18.599> potentials

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
tip is if two items have in potentials

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.830 
tip is if two items have in potentials
and<00:04:19.549> they're<00:04:20.549> kind<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.820> shitty<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.630> put

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and they're kind of shitty and you put

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.219 
and they're kind of shitty and you put
them<00:04:21.959> both<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.349> then<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.729> item<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.960> when

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
them both in then the item you get when

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.270 
them both in then the item you get when
it<00:04:25.349> fuses<00:04:25.680> into<00:04:25.830> one

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
it fuses into one

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.310 
it fuses into one
has<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> higher<00:04:26.820> chance<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:27.270> getting<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:28.020> hidden

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
has a higher chance of getting a hidden

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.590 
has a higher chance of getting a hidden
potential<00:04:28.650> as<00:04:28.830> well<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.340> that's<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
potential as well so that's just a

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.560 
potential as well so that's just a
little<00:04:30.690> tip<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.700> I'm<00:04:32.700> probably<00:04:33.000> for<00:04:33.450> this

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
little tip and I'm probably for this

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.480 
little tip and I'm probably for this
episode<00:04:33.870> I'm<00:04:34.170> just<00:04:34.350> going<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.650> selling<00:04:34.889> jr.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.070 
bit higher on the half earrings with
hidden<00:04:43.410> potential<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.520> tried<00:04:45.419> for<00:04:45.630> one<00:04:45.810> or

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
hidden potential but I tried for one or

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.320 
hidden potential but I tried for one or
two<00:04:46.440> mil<00:04:47.040> but<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.310> guess<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.669> was<00:04:47.820> kind<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:48.180> high
