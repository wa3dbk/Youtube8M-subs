bed report cards let me show that mean
check<00:01:08.200> out<00:01:08.290> for<00:01:09.070> random<00:01:10.000> cards<00:01:10.299> here

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.800 

and<00:01:14.100> you'd<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.690> spectral<00:01:15.690> select<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and you'd have the spectral select the

and you'd have the spectral select the
last<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.440> they<00:01:19.590> taste<00:01:19.800> stopping<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.610> right

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
last one so they taste stopping be right

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.440 
last one so they taste stopping be right
here<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> watch<00:01:25.800> this<00:01:25.980> card<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.370> right<00:01:26.640> one

here so watch this card here right one
two<00:01:27.810> three<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.620> follow<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.090> if

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
two three four follow that for right if

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
two three four follow that for right if
you<00:01:31.170> reverse<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.440> lord<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.890> package<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
you reverse the lord of the package just

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.660 
you reverse the lord of the package just
like<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.790> cards<00:01:33.570> actually<00:01:33.830> on<00:01:34.830> top<00:01:35.370> before

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
like so cards actually on top before

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.180 
like so cards actually on top before
clubs<00:01:36.120> take<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.230> four<00:01:37.380> called<00:01:37.560> places<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.010> the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
clubs take the four called places on the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.570 
clubs take the four called places on the
bottom<00:01:38.490> snap<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.300> jumps<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.070> copy<00:01:41.070> following

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
bottom snap it jumps to copy following

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.060 
bottom snap it jumps to copy following
this<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.910> watch<00:01:42.090> I'll<00:01:43.080> take<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> place<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this to watch I'll take it place it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
this to watch I'll take it place it
third<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> top<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.180> time<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.480> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
third from the top this time so it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.000 
third from the top this time so it's
even<00:01:45.750> harder<00:01:46.050> for<00:01:46.080> me<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.230> get<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
even harder for me to get to the top you

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.420 
even harder for me to get to the top you
know<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.180> same<00:01:48.210> difficulty<00:01:49.430> now

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
know it's still the same difficulty now

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.750 
know it's still the same difficulty now
I'll<00:01:50.580> place<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.940> on<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.150> table<00:01:51.530> snap<00:01:52.760> actually

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
I'll place it on the table snap actually

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.750 
I'll place it on the table snap actually
on<00:01:54.090> top<00:01:54.590> matter<00:01:55.590> where<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.550> put<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
on top matter where is where you put it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.520 
on top matter where is where you put it
it's<00:01:57.090> always<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.480> be<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.960> top<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it's always going to be on top of the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.660 
it's always going to be on top of the
pack

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670
