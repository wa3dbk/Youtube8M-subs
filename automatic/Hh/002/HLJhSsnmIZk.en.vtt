00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.810
 I am bertrand dubois I propose you 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.620
 an exercise that consists of giving life and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.300
 still life 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.210
 for that we showed on the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.760
 colors and shadows and give 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.620
 volume to the whole of the still life 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.809
 I work on Canson paper in 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.230
 grape format 180 grams and at the 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.230
 acrylic paint 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.539
 so we will start by sorting on 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.940
 the range to give volume to this 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.320
 fruit I'm going to put a shadow and by 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.059
 following we will put reflections of 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.969
 light I'm going to put blue in my 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.920
 orange in order to find the color of 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.600
 shadow a blue uncle being the actor 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.699
 complementary it will add a 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.260
 contrast is rarely giving 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.420
 volume to our orange 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.729
 I will add a little bit of orange 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.500
 for shades and gradients 1 so that it 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.960
 be a little sweeter after I'm going 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.450
 put some light reflections by 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.789
 on to give a little matter in 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.860
 orange for wise loved white domont 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.619
 orange I will resume yellow at 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.080
 red put a little bit of white 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.350
 in if I add even more 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.409
 white of course the contrast will be more 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.380
 important now i'm going to start 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.929
 give life to eggplant ag ag 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.670
 darker surface on the inn in and 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.649
 after that I will put colors 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.060
 lighter to work the reflections 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.350
 given this shiny appearance 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.539
 I'm going to start so do not do a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.490
 so mix eggplant color I 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.820
 I'll do it by mixing blue 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.229
 ultramarine and red carmine red and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.850
 I can possibly add some 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.390
 brown in really has a color 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.520
 very dark eggplant that have been going this 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.950
 really showcase when angel and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.530
 a contrast of both light and 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.149
 values ​​so I'm going to put colors 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.609
 much clearer on the banks in 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.850
 to give that illusion of reflections from 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.609
 light which of course I lead White 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.620
 I like being a color is clear 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:13.620
 the reflections a little ch or beige tones 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.320
 but I'm making reflections really have a 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.180
 value contrast by putting 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.410
 light colors are that their darker I 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.269
 am going to do some degrading in 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.340
 intermediate colors between the color 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.190
 eggplant and the color of the reflection 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.650
 some reflections jfr very bright alain 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.380
 age but almost pure white for 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.109
 to have a contrast so bad then we'll go 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.420
 follow a little the material to give us 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.819
 of the volume I added some more 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.060
 even darker downstairs and it darkens and 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.960
 bone 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 so I put blue 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.900
 I'm going to mix at one of the range for 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.940
 make a dark color even add 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.090
 a little brown she really 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 eggplant color very dark for good 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.590
 show the shadow I work by 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.270
 layering like 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.550
 the sim paint acrylic which is opaque 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.130
 we can easily superimpose 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.850
 layers of colors and it also gives 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.330
 a matter a grain effect a little it 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.020
 gives a warm look to the image 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.900
 to make shadows 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.150
 I'm in cold colors of the glass so 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.150
 in my red which I am mixing 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.100
 I will add pure red for 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.670
 soften our degrade and nuances 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.380
 colours 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.170
 I will use a little more red 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 orange to make more parties 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.770
 clear now i'm going to do is 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.780
 the reflections of which are very clear 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.850
 so I used white I'm going 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.280
 mix a little with red to make 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.010
 a clear rose that he gave us all 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.770
 the aspect of course shining june a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.920
 pepper that is starting to be really 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.590
 living in light add them a little 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.570
 little pink if you want to do one and 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.420
 graded be a little softer I 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.370
 added white for really accentuated 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.590
 some reflections so here is just 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.090
 reason by color overlay but 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.440
 as long as they have no water for the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.250
 white be really very readable the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.590
 green part 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.389
 I made my mixture but yellow the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.699
 if I know how to say a little I put some 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.789
 orange of the buzz in I did some 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.550
 places where I will see more clearly 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.979
 I like the white pen so I'm going 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 to make dark green which I take from 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.150
 yellow blue 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.630
 so of course I do not have white on 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.630
 donate in a row made the shadow of iron 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.720
 I am going now 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.430
 started to attack the sheet and for that 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.100
 I will put the shadows on the folds 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.139
 and also shadows to do the 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.759
 carry a drop shadow that's it for 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.530
 purpose of well ask the obg for not that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.889
 thirsty time and see my put it 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.229
 value 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.880
 you can notice that the color of 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.310
 draping gellé voluntarily changed 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.919
 I loved a lot younger and more 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.500
 clear to accentuate the contrasts 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.330
 between objects and vegetables and 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.669
 fruits that are presented and the tablecloth 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.680
 I'm going to do the mixing now 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.660
 to make my shadow I want to leave 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.360
 no 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.550
 orange so I put yellow and red 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.710
 I darkened a little more by putting less 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.420
 of white and a little more red and I 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.750
 can even tarnish it putting a color 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:31.260
 times in like blue for example 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:32.869
 so gnawing I'm going to number you on 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.580
 eggplant 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:37.619
 if I want the gray and a little I can 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.879
 add blue in the purple I 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:42.020
 am going to do some creases also 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:44.339
 always in their shadow is 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.439
 so the drape I have not necessarily the 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.389
 detail and because it primarily aims 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:51.770
 of course to highlight the purpose of the 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.770
 vegetables and fruits that are on it 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.040
 so to finish I will add 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.770
 a few flashes of light all the more 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.680
 that this nature lie is really 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.330
 based on the brightness we can see the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.280
 color contrasts between eggplant 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.780
 which is very dark the squash that is 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.570
 much more beautiful much clearer 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.610
 laurange that very bright the contrast 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.430
 pretty toned between red and green 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.500
 so pepper so here I come from 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.229
 finish by adding some splinters of 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.910
 light to give life and tone 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.210
 the image we can continue the same 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.910
 way following the chart on the 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.280
 squash and its dish while working the same 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.870
 by superimposing colors one is 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.030
 dangerous in and colors 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.660
 complementary to make shadows and 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.100
 by adding shine that is 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.370
 very marked so in this nature 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.370
 dead woman
