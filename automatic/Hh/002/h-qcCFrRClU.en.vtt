00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
this morning we're just about to start

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.670 
this morning we're just about to start
digging<00:00:05.100> out<00:00:05.450> two<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.480> our<00:00:06.779> old<00:00:07.020> farm<00:00:07.290> ponds

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
digging out two of our old farm ponds

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.820 
digging out two of our old farm ponds
and<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.300> digger<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:10.110> drum<00:00:10.380> links<00:00:10.679> way

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
and as the digger just drum links way

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.359 
and as the digger just drum links way
down<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.269> pond<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.660> start<00:00:12.990> work<00:00:14.690> the

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
down to the the pond to start work the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.179 
down to the the pond to start work the
ponds<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> double<00:00:18.539> pond<00:00:18.800> one<00:00:19.800> pond

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
ponds here it's a double pond one pond

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.640 
ponds here it's a double pond one pond
running<00:00:20.490> into<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> other<00:00:21.410> probably<00:00:22.410> would

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
running into the other probably would

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
running into the other probably would
have<00:00:22.740> been<00:00:22.980> either<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.460> horse<00:00:23.789> pond<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.210> maybe<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
have been either a horse pond or maybe a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.769 
have been either a horse pond or maybe a
fish<00:00:24.810> pond<00:00:25.340> because<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:27.539> maybe

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
fish pond because of the or maybe

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.230 
fish pond because of the or maybe
hatchery<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.740> fish<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> ponds

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
hatchery for fish because of the ponds

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.060 
hatchery for fish because of the ponds
running<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.810> end<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> other

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
running one end to the other

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.650 
running one end to the other
and<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.550> probably<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.360> been<00:00:33.540> an

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and it probably would have been an

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.750 
and it probably would have been an
ancient<00:00:33.840> pond<00:00:34.320> probably<00:00:35.040> part<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> old

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
ancient pond probably part of the old

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
ancient pond probably part of the old
Deer<00:00:36.059> Park<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:37.050> many<00:00:37.980> years<00:00:38.070> ago

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
Deer Park that was here many years ago

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.319 
Deer Park that was here many years ago
and<00:00:39.469> if<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.670> taking<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.760> clip<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and if I'm taking this clip about a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
and if I'm taking this clip about a
month<00:00:42.570> ago<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.559> these<00:00:43.890> ponds<00:00:44.190> would

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
month ago all this these ponds would

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.029 
month ago all this these ponds would
have<00:00:44.460> been<00:00:44.579> very<00:00:44.789> shaded<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.039> hedge

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
have been very shaded by all the hedge

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.440 
have been very shaded by all the hedge
and<00:00:47.219> brush<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.850> sort<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> grown<00:00:48.270> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and brush that has sort of grown up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.680 
and brush that has sort of grown up
around<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> ponds<00:00:50.180> which<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.510> being

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
around the ponds which is just being

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.889 
around the ponds which is just being
cleared<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.850> Ben<00:00:53.850> Martin<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> his<00:00:54.539> brother

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
cleared by Ben Martin and his brother

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.869 
cleared by Ben Martin and his brother
and<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.760> they're<00:00:57.000> clear<00:00:57.210> ready<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
and so now they're clear ready for the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.740 
and so now they're clear ready for the
ponds<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.059> cleared<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> we're

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
ponds to be cleared and what we're

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
ponds to be cleared and what we're
hoping<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.879> banks<00:01:03.149> are<00:01:03.270> sort<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
hoping to do is to the banks are sort of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
hoping to do is to the banks are sort of
quite<00:01:03.690> steep<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> pond<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
quite steep on this pond so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
quite steep on this pond so
unfortunately<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.909> know<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> still

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
unfortunately you know that is still

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.789 
unfortunately you know that is still
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> case<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> dog<00:01:07.590> out

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
going to be the case when the dog out

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.580 
going to be the case when the dog out
but<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:09.350> possibly<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
but we also want to do possibly over the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
but we also want to do possibly over the
back<00:01:10.799> area<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.400> pond<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
back area of this pond here and of the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
back area of this pond here and of the
top<00:01:13.229> pond<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.310> towards<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
top pond they're going back towards the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.830 
top pond they're going back towards the
wood<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.090> create<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.950> shelf

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
wood is create a little bit of a shelf

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
wood is create a little bit of a shelf
so<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.409> sort<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> different<00:01:20.040> depths<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so we get sort of different depths of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.960 
so we get sort of different depths of
the<00:01:20.520> water<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.570> hopefully<00:01:21.720> encourage

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
the water which will hopefully encourage

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
the water which will hopefully encourage
different<00:01:24.530> species<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> water<00:01:26.250> different

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
different species in the water different

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
different species in the water different
invertebrates<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> water<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> different

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
invertebrates in the water and different

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.450 
invertebrates in the water and different
plants<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.189> well<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.860> part<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.280> an

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
plants as well this is all part of an

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
plants as well this is all part of an
environmental<00:01:33.210> program<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.860> on

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
environmental program we have here on

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
environmental program we have here on
the<00:01:35.280> farm<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.780> environmental

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the farm and we're in an environmental

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.530 
the farm and we're in an environmental
scheme<00:01:37.680> called<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> higher<00:01:38.670> level<00:01:39.090> scheme

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
scheme called the higher level scheme

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.090 
scheme called the higher level scheme
which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> scheme<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> targets

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
which is really a scheme that targets

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.830 
which is really a scheme that targets

farms which is one of our objectives is
to<00:01:52.259> make<00:01:52.590> sure<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.780> try<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.810> restore

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to make sure that we try and restore

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
to make sure that we try and restore
some<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.340> those<00:01:56.460> species<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.750> declined

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
some of those species that have declined

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.990 
some of those species that have declined
since<00:01:58.350> possibly<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> post-war

to<00:02:03.469> to<00:02:04.469> maybe<00:02:04.969> get<00:02:05.969> some<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.240> those<00:02:06.329> species

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to to maybe get some of those species

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
to to maybe get some of those species
back<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> farmer<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> same<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.160> make

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
back on the farmer at the same time make

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.030 
back on the farmer at the same time make
the<00:02:08.819> farm<00:02:09.270> efficient<00:02:10.170> at<00:02:10.319> producing<00:02:10.470> food

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the farm efficient at producing food

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.729 
the farm efficient at producing food
I<00:02:12.750> hope<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:13.959> hear<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.409> it's<00:02:14.650> a

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
I hope you can hear this because it's a

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.289 
I hope you can hear this because it's a
little<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:15.040> windy<00:02:15.189> but<00:02:15.629> this<00:02:16.629> is<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:18.299> third

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
little bit windy but this is a the third

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.440 
little bit windy but this is a the third
pond<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.079> we've<00:02:20.290> dug<00:02:20.950> out<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.150> has<00:02:22.299> now

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
pond that we've dug out and this has now

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690 
pond that we've dug out and this has now
been<00:02:22.629> dug<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:24.129> was<00:02:24.250> basically

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
been dug so we it was basically

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.380 
been dug so we it was basically
completely<00:02:25.390> sheltered<00:02:26.230> by<00:02:26.849> self<00:02:27.849> sown<00:02:28.060> trees

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
completely sheltered by self sown trees

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.699 
completely sheltered by self sown trees
and<00:02:28.629> bushes<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.079> are<00:02:29.170> growing<00:02:29.319> up<00:02:29.500> really

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
and bushes that are growing up really

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.710 
and bushes that are growing up really
out<00:02:29.799> around<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.280> outside<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.480> problem

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
out around the outside and the problem

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.910 
out around the outside and the problem
with<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.470> doesn't<00:02:32.620> let<00:02:32.799> any

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
with that is that it doesn't let any

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
with that is that it doesn't let any
light<00:02:33.129> into<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.489> pond<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.200> species<00:02:35.200> that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
light into the pond and so species that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.770 
light into the pond and so species that
require<00:02:35.829> lighter<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.609> no<00:02:36.730> longer<00:02:36.970> use<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.359> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
require lighter can no longer use it and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.899 
require lighter can no longer use it and
it<00:02:37.870> also<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.319> very<00:02:38.530> stagnant<00:02:38.799> with<00:02:39.549> lots<00:02:39.790> of

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
it also is very stagnant with lots of

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.369 
it also is very stagnant with lots of
leaf<00:02:40.120> litter<00:02:40.389> and<00:02:40.480> branches<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.170> debris

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
leaf litter and branches and debris

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.759 
leaf litter and branches and debris
which<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.400> all<00:02:42.489> been<00:02:42.519> pulled<00:02:42.939> out<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.620> they

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
which have all been pulled out so they

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.059 
which have all been pulled out so they
lie<00:02:45.159> ready<00:02:45.790> they're<00:02:46.060> waiting<00:02:46.659> for<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.950> be

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
lie ready they're waiting for to be

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.679 
lie ready they're waiting for to be
burned<00:02:48.340> later<00:02:48.639> on<00:02:48.849> when<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.060> all<00:02:49.180> dries<00:02:49.450> out

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
burned later on when it all dries out

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.679 
burned later on when it all dries out
and<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:50.739> put<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> spoil<00:02:51.370> from<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.730> ponder<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
and we put the spoil from the ponder the

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.659 
and we put the spoil from the ponder the
soil<00:02:53.319> from<00:02:53.439> the<00:02:53.590> pond<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.069> size<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.549> you

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
soil from the pond and the size as you

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.610 
soil from the pond and the size as you
can<00:02:54.819> see<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.239> wish<00:02:55.780> actually<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.139> very<00:02:56.349> rich

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
can see I wish actually is very rich

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.649 
can see I wish actually is very rich
with<00:02:56.829> nutrients<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.939> expect<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.299> crops<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
with nutrients so I expect the crops and

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.420 
with nutrients so I expect the crops and
those<00:02:58.750> little<00:02:58.959> patches<00:02:59.319> will<00:02:59.470> grow<00:02:59.650> very<00:02:59.889> well

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
those little patches will grow very well

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.640 
those little patches will grow very well
over<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.819> next<00:03:00.970> few<00:03:01.120> years<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.470> very

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
over the next few years but it's very

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.309 
over the next few years but it's very
exciting<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.489> one<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.700> those<00:03:03.790> things

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
exciting it's just one of those things

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.599 
exciting it's just one of those things
sort<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.439> working<00:03:05.769> in<00:03:05.889> ponds<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.400> kind

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
sort of working in ponds and that kind

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.699 
sort of working in ponds and that kind
of<00:03:06.669> thing<00:03:06.849> which<00:03:07.359> makes<00:03:07.689> them<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.560> know

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
of thing which makes them you know

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.679 
of thing which makes them you know
farming<00:03:09.459> really<00:03:09.730> exciting<00:03:10.209> it's<00:03:10.389> not<00:03:10.450> always

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
farming really exciting it's not always

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.809 
farming really exciting it's not always
about<00:03:10.930> growing<00:03:11.349> crops<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.829> doing<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.549> all

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
about growing crops and doing that all

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.899 
about growing crops and doing that all
the<00:03:12.970> other<00:03:13.120> things<00:03:13.419> that<00:03:13.569> go<00:03:13.720> with<00:03:14.139> um<00:03:14.909> you

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
the other things that go with um you

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.869 
the other things that go with um you
know<00:03:16.030> being<00:03:16.510> having<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.169> privilege<00:03:17.349> of

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
know being having the privilege of

know being having the privilege of
managing<00:03:18.879> a<00:03:19.090> piece<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.659> land

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
managing a piece of land

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.379 
managing a piece of land
so<00:03:22.239> I'm<00:03:22.959> now<00:03:23.229> back<00:03:23.560> at<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:24.459> first<00:03:24.729> two<00:03:24.940> ponds<00:03:25.209> I

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
so I'm now back at the first two ponds I

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.809 
so I'm now back at the first two ponds I
showed<00:03:25.599> you<00:03:25.810> now<00:03:25.959> they've<00:03:26.139> just<00:03:26.440> been<00:03:27.310> dug<00:03:27.639> out

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
showed you now they've just been dug out

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.229 
showed you now they've just been dug out
and<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:29.079> first<00:03:29.379> top<00:03:29.680> pond<00:03:29.949> here<00:03:30.250> with<00:03:31.209> a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
and this first top pond here with a

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.909 
and this first top pond here with a
little<00:03:31.510> cartway<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.290> down<00:03:32.470> into<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.829> we've

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
little cartway going down into it we've

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.759 
little cartway going down into it we've
just<00:03:32.949> cleaned<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.489> out<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.319> first<00:03:35.590> top

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
just cleaned that out and the first top

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.170 
just cleaned that out and the first top
one<00:03:35.919> is<00:03:36.010> quite<00:03:36.220> shallow<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.819> that's<00:03:36.940> good

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
one is quite shallow but that's good

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.300 
one is quite shallow but that's good
because<00:03:37.359> it<00:03:37.659> means<00:03:37.870> it'll<00:03:38.049> warm<00:03:38.739> up<00:03:38.949> quickly

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
because it means it'll warm up quickly

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.750 
because it means it'll warm up quickly
in<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> springtime<00:03:40.569> good<00:03:41.109> for<00:03:41.519> frogs<00:03:42.519> ball

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
in the springtime good for frogs ball

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.059 
in the springtime good for frogs ball
and<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.090> kind<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.389> thing<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.810> also<00:03:44.069> other

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
and that kind of thing and also other

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.180 
and that kind of thing and also other
invertebrates<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.879> like<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.720> warmer

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
invertebrates that like the warmer

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.069 
invertebrates that like the warmer
shallower<00:03:48.190> depths<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.819> also<00:03:49.180> further<00:03:49.510> plants

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
shallower depths and also further plants

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.339 
shallower depths and also further plants
as<00:03:50.229> well<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:51.129> his<00:03:51.370> little<00:03:52.349> overspill

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
as well and then his little overspill

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.659 
as well and then his little overspill
that<00:03:53.500> goes<00:03:53.650> down<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.919> this<00:03:54.129> slightly<00:03:54.370> deeper

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
that goes down to this slightly deeper

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.640 
that goes down to this slightly deeper
pond<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.419> we've<00:03:55.510> got<00:03:55.629> both<00:03:55.810> habitats<00:03:56.409> here

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
pond so we've got both habitats here

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.289 
pond so we've got both habitats here
both<00:03:57.569> deeper<00:03:58.569> water<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:58.989> shallow<00:03:59.560> water<00:03:59.889> and

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
both deeper water and shallow water and

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.520 
both deeper water and shallow water and
the<00:04:01.299> hedge<00:04:01.449> along<00:04:01.629> the<00:04:01.840> back<00:04:01.989> row<00:04:02.229> that<00:04:02.409> we

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
the hedge along the back row that we

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.259 
the hedge along the back row that we
copper<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.040> let<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.280> grow<00:04:03.609> back<00:04:03.819> up<00:04:04.000> again

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
copper so let that grow back up again

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.199 
copper so let that grow back up again
and<00:04:05.139> but<00:04:05.979> probably<00:04:06.459> keep<00:04:06.669> it<00:04:06.819> quite<00:04:07.000> low

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
and but probably keep it quite low

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.179 
and but probably keep it quite low
because<00:04:07.359> this<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.720> south-facing<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.919> we<00:04:09.040> want

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
because this is south-facing and we want

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:10.409 
because this is south-facing and we want
the<00:04:09.280> Sun<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.609> come<00:04:09.699> in<00:04:09.849> here<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.120> warm<00:04:10.299> this

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
the Sun to come in here and warm this

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.530 
the Sun to come in here and warm this
pond<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:10.840> again<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.669> shell<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.150> pond<00:04:13.299> so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
pond up again but a shell of the pond so

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.789 
pond up again but a shell of the pond so
you<00:04:13.689> know<00:04:13.810> because<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.199> a<00:04:14.229> double<00:04:14.470> one<00:04:14.769> I

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
you know because this is a double one I

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.740 
you know because this is a double one I
think<00:04:14.979> this<00:04:15.129> is<00:04:15.250> probably<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:16.000> most<00:04:16.030> exciting

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
think this is probably the most exciting

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.800 
think this is probably the most exciting
one<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.940> looking<00:04:19.239> forward<00:04:19.479> to<00:04:19.570> see

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
one and really looking forward to see

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.649 
one and really looking forward to see
how<00:04:19.840> quickly<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.529> colonizes<00:04:21.279> with<00:04:21.659> everything

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
how quickly it colonizes with everything

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.279 
how quickly it colonizes with everything
that<00:04:22.779> a<00:04:22.810> farm<00:04:23.110> pond<00:04:23.380> should<00:04:23.620> colonized<00:04:24.099> with
