00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
look both ways before going through that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
look both ways before going through that
red<00:01:03.180> light<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> imagine<00:01:10.080> weaving

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
red light and so you can imagine weaving

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.200 
red light and so you can imagine weaving
through<00:01:11.070> traffic<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.729> through<00:01:11.850> red<00:01:12.180> lights

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
through traffic going through red lights

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.140 
through traffic going through red lights
blowing<00:01:12.960> through<00:01:13.140> stop<00:01:13.380> signs<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:14.159> pretty

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
blowing through stop signs it's pretty

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
blowing through stop signs it's pretty
exciting<00:01:15.479> stuff<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.409> thought<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
exciting stuff and and I thought that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
exciting stuff and and I thought that
every<00:01:20.159> shift<00:01:20.460> I'd<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.689> crazy

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
every shift I'd be going to these crazy

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.460 
every shift I'd be going to these crazy
burners<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> reality<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
burners like this one but the reality is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710 
burners like this one but the reality is
that<00:01:25.500> fires<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.759> actually<00:01:27.060> account

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that fires like this actually account

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
that fires like this actually account
