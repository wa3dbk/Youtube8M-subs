00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.390

 I turn around there is everything 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:13.500
 go burn in my mac sauce 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.080
 the pasta because I had already put the water 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.690
 fire to make it go with the sauce 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.650
 I was n't too much the flame just to not 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.510
 because I don't want it to burn then 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.510

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.120
