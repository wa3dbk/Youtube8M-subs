the blackberry z10 you can see the case
here<00:00:14.630> this<00:00:14.809> is<00:00:14.960> a<00:00:15.040> two-part<00:00:16.040> design<00:00:16.430> for

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
here this is a two-part design for

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.850 
here this is a two-part design for
active<00:00:17.480> individuals<00:00:17.990> I'm<00:00:18.349> guessing<00:00:18.740> by<00:00:18.830> the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
active individuals I'm guessing by the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.429 
active individuals I'm guessing by the
name<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.220> have<00:00:19.310> no<00:00:19.430> idea<00:00:19.520> but<00:00:20.300> it's<00:00:21.140> got<00:00:21.260> this

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
name I have no idea but it's got this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.150 
name I have no idea but it's got this
inside<00:00:22.329> kind<00:00:23.329> of<00:00:23.450> silicone<00:00:24.169> rubbery<00:00:24.590> floppy

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
inside kind of silicone rubbery floppy

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.979 
inside kind of silicone rubbery floppy
wrap<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:25.849> then<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.329> your<00:00:26.360> hard<00:00:26.810> shell

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
wrap and then you have your hard shell

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.780 
wrap and then you have your hard shell
on<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.079> outside<00:00:27.169> which<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:28.340> good<00:00:28.489> bumper

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
on the outside which it's good bumper

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.310 
on the outside which it's good bumper
for<00:00:28.970> your<00:00:29.060> corners<00:00:29.450> in<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.750> back<00:00:29.899> and<00:00:30.140> things

for your corners in the back and things
like<00:00:30.470> that<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:30.980> um<00:00:31.570> you<00:00:32.570> can<00:00:32.720> see<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:32.989> here<00:00:33.200> let

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
like that so um you can see it here let

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.250 
like that so um you can see it here let
me<00:00:33.710> assemble<00:00:34.220> it<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.640> obviously<00:00:35.149> not<00:00:35.450> very

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
me assemble it it's obviously not very

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.229 
me assemble it it's obviously not very
good<00:00:36.649> on<00:00:36.770> its<00:00:36.920> own<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:37.610> once<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:37.940> stick<00:00:38.120> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
good on its own but once we stick the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.710 
good on its own but once we stick the
device<00:00:38.480> here<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:39.020> in<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.440> second<00:00:39.830> you'll<00:00:39.980> see<00:00:40.190> it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
device here in in a second you'll see it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.880 
device here in in a second you'll see it
it's<00:00:41.720> got<00:00:41.840> a<00:00:41.870> cool<00:00:42.050> color<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.560> it's<00:00:42.680> a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
it's got a cool color to it it's a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.890 
it's got a cool color to it it's a
little<00:00:43.160> it's<00:00:43.940> not<00:00:44.060> so<00:00:44.180> much<00:00:44.210> rubbery<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:44.750> it's

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
little it's not so much rubbery but it's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.530 
little it's not so much rubbery but it's
got<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.050> decent<00:00:45.260> amount<00:00:45.410> of<00:00:45.620> grip<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.540> which

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
got a decent amount of grip to it which

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.640 
got a decent amount of grip to it which
is<00:00:47.690> good<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.020> when<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.200> have<00:00:48.290> your<00:00:48.410> device

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
is good so when you have your device

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.720 
is good so when you have your device
down<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.070> not<00:00:49.190> going<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.370> slide<00:00:49.520> all<00:00:49.640> over

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
down it's not going to slide all over

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.610 
down it's not going to slide all over
the<00:00:49.910> place<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:50.360> we're<00:00:51.110> go<00:00:51.170> ahead<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.380> throw<00:00:51.470> it

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
the place so we're go ahead and throw it

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.670 
the place so we're go ahead and throw it
in<00:00:51.710> which<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:53.020> kind<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.170> hard<00:00:54.320> part<00:00:54.380> when

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
in which is kind of the hard part when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.170 
in which is kind of the hard part when
you<00:00:54.740> do<00:00:54.830> it<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> first<00:00:55.130> time<00:00:55.280> around<00:00:55.400> but<00:00:55.760> once

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
you do it the first time around but once

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.340 
you do it the first time around but once
you<00:00:56.240> figure<00:00:56.420> it<00:00:56.510> out<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:56.720> not<00:00:56.840> too<00:00:56.990> bad<00:00:57.110> so

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
you figure it out it's not too bad so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.670 
you figure it out it's not too bad so
this<00:00:57.530> guy<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:58.670> wraps<00:00:58.940> all<00:00:59.290> up<00:01:00.290> around<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
this guy just wraps all up around the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.080 
this guy just wraps all up around the
device<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.340> can<00:01:01.370> see<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.880> know<00:01:01.970> it's

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
device and you can see you know it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.370 
device and you can see you know it's
kind<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.390> fun<00:01:02.570> case<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:02.930> its<00:01:03.050> own<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:03.350> you

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
kind of a fun case on its own if you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.319

you<00:01:18.079> get<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.319> going<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:19.999> kind<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.179> snap

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
you get it going you just kind of snap

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.559 
you get it going you just kind of snap

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
it on and you have to work the the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.309 
it on and you have to work the the
silicone<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> little<00:01:24.439> bit<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:26.079> once<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.200> do

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
silicone in a little bit and once you do

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.059 
silicone in a little bit and once you do
that<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.740> get<00:01:28.039> it<00:01:28.159> up<00:01:28.340> where<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.639> needs<00:01:28.789> to<00:01:28.880> go

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
that and get it up where it needs to go

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.980 
that and get it up where it needs to go
