00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello dear friends today to me 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.840
 another parcel came to the league and now 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.179
 we are with you and consider this 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 small set that we have here 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.070
 car two little man and motorcycle well 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.080
 what let's print and see what 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:39.570
 same is inside so when you start 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:45.539
 hide sachet number one sachet 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:56.329
 number two stickers and of course 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:59.820
 instruction and fruit standard also 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.920
 ordinary stickers only negative 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 lego the fact that they are not now 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 bother about 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 stamps have become just like the rest 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.030
 designers just print stickers 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.350
 ordinary packages with items and second 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.900
 bag, let's all open and collect 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 our designer 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.380
 well, that's basically fast enough we 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 collected our set let's consider it 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 Let's start more closely with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 a motorcyclist is such an ordinary motorcycle 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.990
 here are fixings so that he doesn't 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:47.270
 fell was a very convenient thing 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 handcuffed man himself 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:56.030
 small money and bag leave it in 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.270
 aside 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.540
 here we have a fence too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.960
 simple enough with ordinary stickers 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.960
 Well, the man himself a policeman 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:24.420
 also a bag with items in which a 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:30.730
 the radio is such a thing this is ours 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.250
 loudspeaker flashlight and handcuffs well 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.579
 and more interest is of course 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.069
 the machine itself will see here 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.560
 in more detail 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.090
 if we look from above we can 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.489
 see the rotating spotlight which 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:58.989
 the flashlight also moves in different directions 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:03:03.010
 it further opens in the back and here we are 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.599
 we can put the prisoner here 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.870
 ordinary grilles and another place for 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:19.509
 storage and transportation of any 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:24.060
 items but also instead of the driver here 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:24.060
 may well fit two people 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:32.049
 let's see what's inside the roof 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.180
 removed too easily and easily 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.109
 I contemplate the internal state 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.109
 the car 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:47.620
 everything is done fairly well 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:52.090
 easy going to get it right here 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.229
 I still understand that the driver has a mug 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:02.199
 with tea well, in general, you can our heroes 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:05.229
 put in inside here they are here with 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:08.620
 ease it all placed 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:12.989
 closes well and our prisoner 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.590
 you can also put a camera 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:21.600
 Of course, you will first need to remove 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:27.080
 his bag is well in the general course so well 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.080
 close all our actions 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.290
 But in general, such an interesting model 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.360
 in front of the stickers here is also a sticker 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.400
 probably behind the sticker 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.960
 the only minus that I have now 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.260
 I like the evidence 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.490
 and also gah we have here something like 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:05.040
 binoculars although they are used entirely by 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:09.710
 another purpose like sevu in general 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.510
 Here is such an interesting simple set 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.289
 Thank you for your attention and see you in 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.289
 next issues
