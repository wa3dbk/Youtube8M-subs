I thought of wood so I'm trying
something<00:01:57.470> different<00:01:57.619> with<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.280> liner<00:01:58.490> on

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
something different with the liner on

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.719 
something different with the liner on
first<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.209> then<00:01:59.360> connecting<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.200> shadow<00:02:00.729> I'm

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
first and then connecting the shadow I'm

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.449 
first and then connecting the shadow I'm
not<00:02:01.970> perfect<00:02:02.299> my<00:02:03.080> advice<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:03.890> liquid<00:02:04.220> liner

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
not perfect my advice with liquid liner

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.149 
not perfect my advice with liquid liner
is<00:02:05.209> start<00:02:05.630> off<00:02:05.750> slow<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.200> keep<00:02:06.619> building<00:02:06.950> on

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
is start off slow and keep building on

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.199 
is start off slow and keep building on
it<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.429> look<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.239> all<00:02:08.509> about<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.280> liner<00:02:10.489> so

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
it this look is all about the liner so

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.820 
it this look is all about the liner so
instead<00:02:11.540> we're<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.870> going<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.230> for<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> big

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
instead we're just going in for the big

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.979 
instead we're just going in for the big
troop<00:02:13.519> at<00:02:13.790> first<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.330> know<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.630> start<00:02:14.900> off

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
troop at first you know just start off

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:23.400 
troop at first you know just start off
so<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.440> build<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:15.920> Bilbo<00:02:16.370> Bilbo

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.590 

now<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> liner<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.360> kind

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
now that I have the liner on I can kind

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.270 
now that I have the liner on I can kind
of<00:02:25.660> determine<00:02:26.200> where<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> want<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.830> shadow<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
of determine where I want the shadow to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.570 
of determine where I want the shadow to
start<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.240> finish<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.380> I'm<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.890> grab<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
start and finish so I'm going to grab a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760 
start and finish so I'm going to grab a
actually<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> stiff<00:02:31.870> little<00:02:32.080> angled<00:02:32.530> brush

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
actually a stiff little angled brush

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.320 
actually a stiff little angled brush
like<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.430> which<00:02:33.670> normally<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> would

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
like this one which normally I would

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090 
like this one which normally I would
never<00:02:34.480> use<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:34.960> shadow<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.440> since<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.800> want<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
never use for shadow but since I want a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.160 
never use for shadow but since I want a
really<00:02:36.280> precise<00:02:36.820> line<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.480> there<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.720> think

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
really precise line up there I think

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.850 
really precise line up there I think
this<00:02:38.290> will<00:02:38.440> be<00:02:38.560> easier

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.820

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
I'm just pressing the shadow lightly in

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.990 
I'm just pressing the shadow lightly in
and<00:02:53.930> I'm<00:02:54.860> just<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.250> highlight<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.670> little
