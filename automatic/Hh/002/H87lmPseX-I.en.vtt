with the cumberbund so one of the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.109 
with the cumberbund so one of the
standard<00:01:31.110> problems<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.700> or

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
standard problems that we would have or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
challenges we would have when we went

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.210 
challenges we would have when we went
from<00:01:35.729> male<00:01:36.150> body<00:01:36.540> armor<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.979> put

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
from male body armor and and would put

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
from male body armor and and would put
that<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.490> female<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.479> although<00:01:39.689> they

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that on female is that although they

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
that on female is that although they
were<00:01:40.110> adequately<00:01:40.860> protected<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.479> get

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
were adequately protected we would get

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
were adequately protected we would get
the<00:01:42.780> bell<00:01:43.020> effect<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.130> most<00:01:44.369> males<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:45.030> pretty

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the bell effect so most males are pretty

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
the bell effect so most males are pretty
barrel<00:01:45.600> chested<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.500> even<00:01:47.100> from

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
barrel chested pretty even from

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
barrel chested pretty even from
shoulders<00:01:48.030> through<00:01:48.299> chest<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.990> waist

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
shoulders through chest to waist

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.179 
shoulders through chest to waist
and<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.610> when<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.240> increased<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> opened<00:01:53.070> up

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and so when you increased and opened up

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.120 
and so when you increased and opened up
the<00:01:53.430> area<00:01:53.970> around<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> chest<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> would

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the area around the chest then you would

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.030 
the area around the chest then you would
have<00:01:56.310> excess<00:01:57.060> area<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.960> coverage<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
have excess area of coverage in the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
have excess area of coverage in the
waist<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.149> cause<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
waist and then that would cause a lot of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.859 
waist and then that would cause a lot of
shifting<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.979> movement<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> female

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
shifting and movement around on a female

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.969 
shifting and movement around on a female
and<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.159> ultimately<00:02:05.700> result<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:07.020> some

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and that would ultimately result in some

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.000 
and that would ultimately result in some
some<00:02:08.459> wearing<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> hips<00:02:10.009> very<00:02:11.009> being<00:02:11.520> very

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
some wearing on the hips very being very

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.699 
some wearing on the hips very being very
uncomfortable<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.689> female<00:02:14.049> would<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.500> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
uncomfortable if a female would have to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.490 
uncomfortable if a female would have to
sit<00:02:14.950> down<00:02:15.129> for<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.519> long<00:02:15.730> time<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:17.049> would<00:02:17.230> rub

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
sit down for a long time that would rub

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.710 
sit down for a long time that would rub
on<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.920> legs<00:02:18.189> and<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.939> they<00:02:19.090> were<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.450> Humvee

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
on the legs and if they were in a Humvee

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.319 
on the legs and if they were in a Humvee
I've<00:02:20.709> become<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.280> uncomfortable<00:02:21.519> if<00:02:22.209> that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
I've become very uncomfortable if that

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.030 
I've become very uncomfortable if that
were<00:02:22.450> cutting<00:02:22.840> into<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.170> legs<00:02:23.409> and<00:02:23.739> an

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
were cutting into the legs and an

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.979 
were cutting into the legs and an
impacting<00:02:24.819> blood<00:02:25.030> flow<00:02:25.329> and<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.870> also

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
impacting blood flow and I also

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.600 
impacting blood flow and I also
understand<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.650> also<00:02:26.920> harder<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.459> them

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
understand it was also harder for them

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.729 
understand it was also harder for them
to<00:02:27.640> fire<00:02:28.090> their<00:02:28.269> weapons<00:02:28.739> absolutely

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
to fire their weapons absolutely

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.009 
to fire their weapons absolutely
absolutely<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.549> as<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.879> had<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.269> Bell<00:02:31.599> fact

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
absolutely so as you had that Bell fact

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.220 
absolutely so as you had that Bell fact
a<00:02:32.230> bell<00:02:32.470> effect<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.970> adjustability<00:02:34.780> was

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
a bell effect and the adjustability was

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.979 
a bell effect and the adjustability was
somewhat<00:02:35.620> limited<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.610> regards<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
somewhat limited with regards to the

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.890 
somewhat limited with regards to the
female<00:02:38.349> form<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:39.760> became<00:02:40.060> harder<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
female form it became harder to get a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.020 
female form it became harder to get a
good<00:02:41.459> chest<00:02:42.689> fit<00:02:43.689> shoulder<00:02:44.379> weld<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.400> on

good chest fit shoulder weld on the on

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.259 
good chest fit shoulder weld on the on
the<00:02:46.299> m4<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:46.900> m16<00:02:47.739> depending<00:02:48.640> on<00:02:48.730> what<00:02:48.909> weapon

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
the m4 or m16 depending on what weapon

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.960 
the m4 or m16 depending on what weapon
the<00:02:49.780> soldier<00:02:50.170> had<00:02:50.409> and<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.250> we<00:02:51.430> wanted<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> make

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
the soldier had and so we wanted to make

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.059 
the soldier had and so we wanted to make
sure<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.599> we<00:02:52.780> adjusted<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.470> shoulder

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
sure that as we adjusted the shoulder

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.199 
sure that as we adjusted the shoulder
fit<00:02:54.400> made<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.150> more<00:02:55.359> narrow<00:02:55.980> accounted<00:02:56.980> for

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
fit made it more narrow accounted for

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.910 
fit made it more narrow accounted for
the<00:02:58.209> bend<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.659> shoulder<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.319> we<00:02:59.620> allowed

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
the bend in the shoulder that we allowed

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.599 
the bend in the shoulder that we allowed
for<00:03:00.250> areas<00:03:00.700> where<00:03:00.970> female<00:03:01.450> soldiers<00:03:02.049> could

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
for areas where female soldiers could

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.520 
for areas where female soldiers could
properly<00:03:03.609> seat<00:03:04.150> their<00:03:04.420> weapon<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.019> fire<00:03:05.349> it

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
properly seat their weapon and fire it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.800 
properly seat their weapon and fire it
effectively<00:03:06.069> now<00:03:06.849> one<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> other<00:03:07.239> items

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
effectively now one of the other items

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.349 
effectively now one of the other items
that<00:03:07.930> we've<00:03:08.170> adjusted<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.250> length<00:03:09.579> so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
that we've adjusted is the length so

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.649 
that we've adjusted is the length so
torso<00:03:11.260> lengths<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.920> females<00:03:12.430> vary<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.420> those

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
torso lengths of females vary from those

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.259 
torso lengths of females vary from those
of<00:03:13.870> males<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.530> we've<00:03:15.430> adjusted<00:03:16.120> that

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
of males and so we've adjusted that

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.289 
of males and so we've adjusted that
length<00:03:16.599> accordingly<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.069> it<00:03:18.579> it<00:03:18.940> it

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
length accordingly so that it it it

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.710 
length accordingly so that it it it
results<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.319> better<00:03:20.590> fit<00:03:21.040> if<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:22.180> soldier

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
results in a better fit if the soldier

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.569 
results in a better fit if the soldier
if<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.049> female<00:03:23.379> soldier<00:03:23.799> has<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.010> move<00:03:24.430> up

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
if the female soldier has to move up

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.020 
if the female soldier has to move up
mountains<00:03:25.090> climb<00:03:25.870> trees<00:03:26.349> in<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.639> out<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
mountains climb trees in and out of

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.789 
mountains climb trees in and out of
vehicles<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.690> lot<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.959> our<00:03:29.049> vehicles<00:03:29.470> are<00:03:29.590> high

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
vehicles a lot of our vehicles are high

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.680 
vehicles a lot of our vehicles are high
up<00:03:29.829> off<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.370> ground<00:03:30.639> so<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> requires<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.599> lot

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
up off the ground so it requires a lot

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.259 
up off the ground so it requires a lot
of<00:03:31.840> leg<00:03:32.169> movement<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.919> get<00:03:33.549> into<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.879> vehicle

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
of leg movement to get into the vehicle

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.390 
of leg movement to get into the vehicle
to<00:03:34.510> enter<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.930> vehicle<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.889> we<00:03:36.040> wanted<00:03:36.340> to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
to enter the vehicle and so we wanted to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.629 
to enter the vehicle and so we wanted to
adjust<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:37.419> link<00:03:37.810> accordingly<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.280> it

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
adjust that link accordingly so that it

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.360 
adjust that link accordingly so that it
more<00:03:39.849> adequately<00:03:40.359> fit<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.989> female<00:03:41.410> torso<00:03:41.799> so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
more adequately fit the female torso so

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.740 
more adequately fit the female torso so
you've<00:03:42.519> shortened<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.000> up<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.329> order<00:03:43.449> to<00:03:43.629> make

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
you've shortened it up in order to make

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.990 
you've shortened it up in order to make
sure<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.049> there<00:03:44.319> have<00:03:44.500> more<00:03:44.790> area<00:03:45.790> of

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
sure that there have more area of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.879 
sure that there have more area of
movement<00:03:46.389> for<00:03:46.480> their<00:03:46.599> legs<00:03:46.840> ways<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.709> be<00:03:47.799> able

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
movement for their legs ways to be able

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.500 
movement for their legs ways to be able
to<00:03:48.040> bend<00:03:48.280> move<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.819> stuff<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.299> so<00:03:49.419> the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
to bend move and stuff like that so the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.220 
to bend move and stuff like that so the
more<00:03:49.660> effective<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.139> battlefield

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
more effective on the battlefield

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.349 
more effective on the battlefield
absolutely<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.519> critical<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.120> note

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
absolutely but it's critical to note

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.000 
absolutely but it's critical to note
that<00:03:52.569> even<00:03:52.690> though<00:03:52.870> we've<00:03:53.199> shortened<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.859> up

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
that even though we've shortened it up

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.670 
that even though we've shortened it up
we<00:03:54.549> have<00:03:54.760> introduced<00:03:55.060> area<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.959> coverage<00:03:56.230> so

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
we have introduced area of coverage so

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.970 
we have introduced area of coverage so
the<00:03:56.799> female<00:03:57.220> vest<00:03:57.669> is<00:03:57.909> just<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:59.079> vital<00:03:59.560> and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
the female vest is just as vital and

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.189 
the female vest is just as vital and
critical<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.760> as<00:04:00.970> protective<00:04:01.720> as<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.989> male
