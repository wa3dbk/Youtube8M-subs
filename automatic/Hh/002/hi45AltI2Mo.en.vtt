00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.730
 decided to replace and signal for alarm 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.179
 30 wadded so I did not know 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.820
 Initially, but he squeaked very quietly this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.910
 a new one, let's say a little louder 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 with that louder, well, not very well 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 taken by battery to come it will 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 Of course yelling like a slice in real life is just 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 dumb she can loudly worth relyushka 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.830
 Well, I don’t know, let's see how 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.340
 better this old account is enough for me yes 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.739
 did not work very quietly 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.270
 decided to move it to another place 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 stood on near the battery old here 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 a new layer but there under the flank schA 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.789
 look like looking old you know well, just 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.930
 one tone is simple and shield from 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.149
 battery louder run than vasche 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.760
 just wiring usual yes there your 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:16.680
 Vileika doesn’t know much about the place 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:22.430
 so, as somewhere, the clearer the contact 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 louder without these creeps points 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.600
 you constantly repeat such a signal 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 but he worked much quieter for that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.730
 that was next to the battery on the I 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.550
 arranged here and the car comes noise 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.340
 some in the city you hardly hear her 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.410
 even near these st very worked 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.410
 voltage okay everything was fine 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.880
 yes you think my switches are laying 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.810
 of course the hood is open 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.670
 Egorom Wednesday is absolutely nothing like 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 such rusted old autumn fasteners again 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:33.489
 I removed pinned there in a different set of 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:33.489
 watt aqua better got better 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.409

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.709
