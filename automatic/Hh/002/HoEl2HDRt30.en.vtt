00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.629
 We have investigated it for some months 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.479
 it's really about 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.479
 of a revolutionary photograph 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.789

 Here he presented the investigation with Fernando Belt

 with the camera of a cell phone it was possible to capture casually 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.160
 a luminous ray on the pyramid of Kukulcán in Chichen Itza 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 a photograph that turned out to be authentic 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.460
 now we invite you to know the history 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.630
 the exhibition of photographs completely real 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.470
 showing light contest that comes out of the pyramid of kukulcan 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 On July 24, 2009 at two in the afternoon with 31 seconds, these 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.790
 shots where a ray of light appears that was caught casually with a cell phone 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.760
 state-of-the-art telephone 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.030
 recorded in the photograph all the details of the shot 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.910
 the date harshly against 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.160
 the photographic exposure time the resolution and size of the image in 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.190
 place of the take with geographic coordinates and also the model and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.100
 cellular brand with which it was achieved in the extraordinary image 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 of undoubtedly majestic aspect 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.700
 a photograph that has been researched and analyzed fully and pf of which 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.010
 they have gathered the evidences testimonies and substantiated their complete to ensure 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 that it is an authentic luminous phenomenon 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.149
 this is this story of the wonderful photograph of the luminous pulse in the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.219
 pyramid of kukulcán in chichén itzá yucatán mexico 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.520
 in october 2009 jaime maussan almost in the presentation of the angels 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.270
 California 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.939
 at the end of the conference they informed him 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.240
 from a very special photograph 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.640
 of which they assured from the beginning was an authentic image so 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.869
 they requested were analyzed 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.910
 the family if erc integrated by Mr. Hector Siliézar 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.999
 his wife glenda hernández 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.060
 and her two daughters Carolina and civilian took a vacation in Cancun 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.840
 They reported that they stayed at a hotel on the Mayan Riviera between the days of 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.669
 June 21 to 28, 2009, a circumstance that we managed to confirm 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:37.439
 when we traveled to cancún tibi we quoted the hotel where they stayed, we met the 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.199
 record sheet that will effectively match the family version 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.400
 whistle 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.740
 who pointed out that on Friday, July 24, they will travel to Chichen Itza 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.170
 from the field of the ball game hector siliézar with his cell phone in hand 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.410
 framed the pyramid obtaining at least three shots the first at 13 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.410
 hours 59 minutes and 48 seconds 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.719
 then invited to pose his daughters carolina and destiny and got a second 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.729
 it takes 14 hours and 12 seconds 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.849
 19 more seconds elapsed when he tried a third photograph at 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.619
 14 hours and thirty-one seconds in which appeared the extraordinary pulse of 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:22.799
 light that emanates directly from the top of the pyramid of Kukulcán 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.819
 the first analyzes showed that it was a real photograph and it was 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.980
 proceeded to complete the investigation by interviewing families and liestal 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.549
 to know completely the whole history of this image so far 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.399
 only 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.499
 perhaps the pyramid of kukulcán that acts as 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.260
 an energy accumulator 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.989
 is being activated recently 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.829
 could this magnificent pyramid have been active since its construction and 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.019
 so far we find physical evidence that it emits pulses of energy 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.629
 the implications are fascinating 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.239
 transcendental 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.379
 could the Mayans have used the pyramid of Kukulcan 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.969
 to emit signals to space 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.879
 perhaps they were in communication with extraterrestrial beings 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.409
 later interviews with witnesses 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.320
 that from the beginning they have affirmed that it is a photograph of the vega
