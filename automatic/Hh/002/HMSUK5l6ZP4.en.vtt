okay<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.070> throughout<00:00:02.520> all<00:00:02.700> these<00:00:02.909> exercises

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay so throughout all these exercises

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay so throughout all these exercises
you<00:00:03.629> know<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.110> always<00:00:04.470> keeping<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.920> time

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
you know on always keeping the time

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.099 
you know on always keeping the time
there's<00:00:05.790> always<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.240> click<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:06.930> so

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
there's always the click going on so

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.570 
there's always the click going on so
when<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.319> try<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.099> your<00:00:08.130> own<00:00:08.250> make

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
when you try to do this on your own make

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.610 
when you try to do this on your own make
sure<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> metronome<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
sure that you do it to a metronome the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.140 
sure that you do it to a metronome the
totally<00:00:10.980> different<00:00:11.010> experience<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.030> do

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
totally different experience if you do

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.430 
totally different experience if you do
it<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.330> metronome<00:00:12.690> versus<00:00:13.110> without<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it with metronome versus without a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
it with metronome versus without a
metronome<00:00:56.120> now<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.329> we're<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.719> talking

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
metronome now here we're just talking

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.720 
metronome now here we're just talking
about<00:00:58.109> rhythm<00:00:58.730> axes<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> sticking<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
about rhythm axes so the sticking is

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:18.530 
about rhythm axes so the sticking is
consistent<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.210> axis

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.820 

notice<00:01:19.540> as<00:01:19.690> I'm<00:01:19.810> used<00:01:20.020> through<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.380> table<00:01:20.740> of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
notice as I'm used through the table of

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.520 
notice as I'm used through the table of
time<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.090> sounding<00:01:22.480> faster<00:01:22.960> it's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
time and it's sounding faster it's

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.810 
time and it's sounding faster it's
getting<00:01:23.770> faster<00:01:23.950> that's<00:01:24.370> an<00:01:24.520> even<00:01:24.730> more

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
getting faster that's an even more

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.840 
getting faster that's an even more
intense<00:01:25.230> so<00:01:26.230> as<00:01:26.410> we<00:01:26.710> go<00:01:26.890> through<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.490> rhythms

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
intense so as we go through the rhythms

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.580 
intense so as we go through the rhythms
it's<00:01:28.600> going<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.840> give<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.080> more<00:01:29.290> intense

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's going to give you more intense

00:01:29.590 --> 00:02:02.830 
it's going to give you more intense
sound<00:01:29.800> locks<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.460> can

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.929 

okay<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> accident<00:02:04.799> once<00:02:05.579> again<00:02:05.820> I'm

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
okay here the accident once again I'm

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
okay here the accident once again I'm
going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.569> rhythm<00:02:06.869> consistent<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.590> Justin

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
going to the rhythm consistent so Justin

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
going to the rhythm consistent so Justin
VCT<00:02:08.280> knows<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.269> can<00:02:09.420> keeping<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> time<00:02:09.989> with

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
VCT knows you can keeping the time with

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.110 
VCT knows you can keeping the time with
the<00:02:10.229> metronome<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.920> moving<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> accents

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the metronome and moving the accents

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:24.830 
the metronome and moving the accents
around<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.510> times<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:24.239> notice<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.660> I'm

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
around the times you notice as I'm

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900 
around the times you notice as I'm
accenting<00:02:25.379> around<00:02:25.650> keeping<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> snare<00:02:26.640> drum

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
accenting around keeping the snare drum

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.330 
accenting around keeping the snare drum
nice<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.780> consistent<00:02:28.079> from<00:02:28.709> dead<00:02:28.950> center<00:02:29.310> to

combining<00:05:19.710> all<00:05:20.220> three<00:05:30.320> notice<00:05:31.320> how<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.470> seems

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
combining all three notice how it seems

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.560 
combining all three notice how it seems
like<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.980> years<00:05:32.190> are<00:05:32.370> changing<00:05:32.730> faster<00:05:33.540> a

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
like the years are changing faster a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.330 
like the years are changing faster a
little<00:05:33.900> slower<00:05:34.169> doesn't<00:05:34.950> seem<00:05:35.100> like<00:05:35.220> I'm

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
little slower doesn't seem like I'm

00:05:35.340 --> 00:06:13.300 
little slower doesn't seem like I'm
working<00:05:49.550> parking<00:05:50.550> spots<00:05:51.120> off<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.960> beat

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.040 

it<00:06:14.310> always<00:06:14.490> comes<00:06:14.789> back<00:06:14.969> to<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.240> clip<00:06:15.509> that's

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
it always comes back to the clip that's

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.450 
it always comes back to the clip that's
because<00:06:16.409> if<00:06:16.499> we're<00:06:16.650> on<00:06:16.740> place<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.099> accent

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
because if we're on place the accent

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.580 
because if we're on place the accent
just<00:06:17.729> is<00:06:18.060> faster<00:06:18.479> slower<00:06:18.840> because<00:06:19.139> we<00:06:19.349> want<00:06:19.530> to

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
just is faster slower because we want to

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.040 
just is faster slower because we want to
do<00:06:19.680> with<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.919> rhythm<00:06:20.189> it<00:06:20.699> easy<00:06:21.689> to<00:06:21.810> get<00:06:21.900> around

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
do with the rhythm it easy to get around

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.239 
do with the rhythm it easy to get around
without<00:06:22.319> which<00:06:22.560> I<00:06:22.680> can<00:06:22.800> working<00:06:22.979> too<00:06:23.219> hard

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:23.249 
without which I can working too hard

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.060 
without which I can working too hard
because<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.819> stick
