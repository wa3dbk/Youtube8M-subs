 doubled

 the repair can be done on the wheel with or without the tire mounted and 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 in the vehicle 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.460
 In any case it is recommended to use a cover when you paint to protect the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.730
 surrounding area 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.010
 The wheel restoration kit is not for use on surfaces of 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.790
 Plastic wheels and should not be used to repair any structural damage 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.920
 of the wheel like cracks kinks 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 Extremely rusty orchestra 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.030
 Before starting the restoration process you will need to study the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.250
 bonfires to determine the type of damage in them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.240
 this show will treat corrosion 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.240
 rust and minor scratches 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.540
 corrosion oxidation and minor scratches are usually caused by the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.940
 salt water and harsh winter conditions but can be repaired 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.580
 following these basic demonstration 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.810
 Step by Step 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.690
 Nava and wheel thoroughly and make sure it is completely dry 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.120
 If you have an area with a lot of corrosion 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.120
 Use the 220 gram sandpaper 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.949
 If the corrosion is minimal then you can use the sandpaper more 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.949
 fine of 320 grams 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.250
 once you chose the right sandpaper 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.099
 and I saw that he had corroded 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.339
 use only your hands and fingers to reach smaller areas 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.989
 yes it started with the 220 grain 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.109
 I finished sanding with the finest of 320 grains to paralyze the area 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.919
 Before painting, clean the area completely using the alcohol wipes and 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.799
 he says he feels 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.159
 Make sure the area is free of grease dust will be 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.349
 and water 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.980
 Use paint for wheels at temperatures between 60 and 92-80 it and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.959
 when the humidity 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.129
 be less than 60% 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.330
 to avoid any excess paint on the tire and today the waves of 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.929
 around it is recommended to use masking tape not to supply 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.719
 permach ex t-includes a silver paint for the wheel doubled smell 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.739
 to restore the original silver color to the wheel 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.139
 that resistant to chemicals to brake dust 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.839
 Heat chiseled and leaves a reflective metallic finish 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.689
 If you are not sure of the color of your wheel try silver paint 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.239
 supplied in a discrete area to verify the color match 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.579
 If the color does not match, visit your local auto parts store for other colors of 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.909
 paints for wheels offered by doubled 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.709
 To start painting shake the silver paint for at least two minutes then 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.629
 that you listen to the mixing ball 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.689
 remove the lid to paint 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.919
 hold the can 20 2 25 centimeters from the surface 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.049
 and start spraying with a side-to-side motion 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.260
 Carefully spray the repaired area until it matches with the rest of the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.399
 wheel 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.709
 to avoid runs and subsidence I applied two light layers followed by 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.109
 a medium moist layer 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.790
 apply all the layers in the course of an hour, allowing ten minutes to pass 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.299
 between each layer 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.760
 the paint of the wheel will dry to the touch in the course of an hour and 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.800
 It will be completely dry at 24 hours 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.429
 once dry carefully remove the masking tape without any use 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.309
