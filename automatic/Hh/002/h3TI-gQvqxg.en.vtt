00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.450
 I find interesting because or accessories 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.310
 have instante 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.510
 I like the tie because I like it 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.860
 about it is that this can look whole 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.860
 change 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.150
 this is now my luka button close 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.960
 measure you in the eighties 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.130
 in the back 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.989
 what can I call now in one 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.100
 quite narrow 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.850
 club bag around length important and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.490
 This is the classic for them 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.790
 follow from behind behind and then 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.790
 through 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.660
 that i am creating now if it is a good one 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.660
 look die der 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.119
 in that it looks very different to me 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.580
 yourself over 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.590
 earth detail finds little can 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.800
 boyish is around the back 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.729
 just a little longer than the front 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.369
 personal thingy detail and there is also 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.010
 another way to decorate your neck 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.049
 and there these two gentlemen know 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.630
 look my many more of the names 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.270
 when it comes to us above all is the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.890
 details it and you start bowtie as follows 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.900
 the right side of the boat from its 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.979
 long side one causes the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.299
 left hand side 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.420
 approximately at the end where the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.180
 final snare for being there 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.890
 that length is then you do 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.220
 the right hand over the left over, therefore, the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 by and let you judge you 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.930
 shoulder 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.670
 you let him rest then comes 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.380
 now the first strictly 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.860
 forth you keep your finger in the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.979
 center of the knot and make yourself with you 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.920
 finger now make a gap between where you 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.130
 him beaten with over it 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.030
 then grab it 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.750
 loose loose base that rotates 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.320
 you take it there and it will arrive 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.760
 forth, then this is actually 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.170
 the most important part of the van 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.390
 stick out a boat 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.580
 is actually whether you release it or fix it and you 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.470
 so you can fix it by the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.970
 right front flap in the left 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.920
 grab the rear flame and put it on 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.630
 and pull it to anybody else for that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.660
 pull you back to nice again 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.180
 eventually if you get a little good 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.810
 recipe you have 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.670
 buddha but what is important now 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.320
 to form that snare and that is 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.120
 actually for yourself how you how it you 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.950
 with the nicest finds 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.560
 well they bowtie good to take off your outfit 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 but what is also great to do 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 for example, a pocket square and ours 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 is mine is common in this case 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.210
 the farmers would do but I would a 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.210
 way to do it
