the exact specs of the race car because
it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> race<00:02:00.959> car<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.440> race<00:02:01.950> teams<00:02:02.220> don't

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
it's a race car and race teams don't

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.109 
it's a race car and race teams don't
like<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.789> lay<00:02:03.690> all<00:02:03.869> their<00:02:04.020> cards<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.530> table

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
like to lay all their cards on the table

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.609 
like to lay all their cards on the table
but<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.390> we've<00:02:06.509> done<00:02:06.690> with<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> GTE<00:02:07.259> Road

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but what we've done with the GTE Road

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219 
but what we've done with the GTE Road
car<00:02:07.860> concept<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.700> we've<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
car concept is we've this is kind of the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.360 
car concept is we've this is kind of the
answer<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> question<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.340> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
answer to the question of what if we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.790 
answer to the question of what if we
took<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> race<00:02:11.910> car<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.680> made<00:02:13.680> it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
took the race car and made it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.240 
took the race car and made it
street-legal<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.840> concept<00:02:16.680> car<00:02:17.099> as

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
street-legal so this is a concept car as

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.240 
street-legal so this is a concept car as
it<00:02:17.400> sits<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.890> contemplating

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it sits here but we're contemplating

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
it sits here but we're contemplating
building<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> small<00:02:21.330> number<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.629> these<00:02:21.840> for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
building a small number of these for

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.410 
building a small number of these for
production<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.830> Road<00:02:23.010> use<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.090> exactly

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
production for Road use but what exactly

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020 
production for Road use but what exactly
made<00:02:24.660> aleman<00:02:25.319> type<00:02:25.739> guy<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.069> opposed<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
made aleman type guy as opposed to the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.030 
made aleman type guy as opposed to the
other<00:02:27.599> two<00:02:27.870> models<00:02:28.200> ago<00:02:28.410> here<00:02:28.620> well<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
other two models ago here well the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
other two models ago here well the
chassis<00:02:29.519> structure<00:02:29.849> itself<00:02:30.510> was<00:02:30.840> very<00:02:30.959> much

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
chassis structure itself was very much

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.250 
chassis structure itself was very much
the<00:02:31.410> same<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.860> road<00:02:32.040> car<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:33.569> suspension

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the same as the road car the suspension

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.320 
the same as the road car the suspension
they<00:02:34.920> added<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.400> components<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.060> made<00:02:36.209> it

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
they added in components that made it

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.619 
they added in components that made it
much<00:02:36.540> more<00:02:36.599> adjustable<00:02:37.379> than<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.739> street<00:02:38.310> car

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
much more adjustable than the street car

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.570 
much more adjustable than the street car
the<00:02:39.629> engine<00:02:39.660> they<00:02:40.560> pumped<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.069> from<00:02:41.190> three<00:02:41.459> and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.089 
lightweight it's all carbon fiber body
panels<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.349> lost<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.680> lot<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:06.830> weight<00:03:07.069> that

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
panels so it lost a lot of weight that

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.360 
panels so it lost a lot of weight that
the<00:03:08.030> road-going<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.780> or<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.050> 3000<00:03:09.680> 46<00:03:10.130> pounds

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the road-going of or is 3000 46 pounds

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.680 
the road-going of or is 3000 46 pounds
that's<00:03:10.730> actually<00:03:11.060> three<00:03:11.269> four<00:03:11.450> hundred

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
that's actually three four hundred

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.589 
that's actually three four hundred
pounds<00:03:11.870> lighter<00:03:12.140> than<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.440> 911<00:03:12.620> yeah<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:14.510> a

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
pounds lighter than a 911 yeah so it's a

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.660 
pounds lighter than a 911 yeah so it's a
it's<00:03:15.319> very<00:03:15.560> lightweight<00:03:15.830> relative<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.580> the

it's very lightweight relative to the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.380 
it's very lightweight relative to the
competition<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:18.019> guys<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:19.150> using<00:03:20.150> your<00:03:20.269> own
