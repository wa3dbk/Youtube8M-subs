00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the structure and with Malik obviously

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
the structure and with Malik obviously
becoming<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:08.610> quarterback<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:10.110> puts<00:01:10.409> us<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

position<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.310> maybe<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.240> more

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
position to maybe be a little bit more

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.020 
position to maybe be a little bit more
multi<00:01:13.439> formational<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.790> things

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
multi formational and do some things

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.350 
learn and figure out whether there's
still<00:02:32.250> air<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> football<00:02:32.879> like<00:02:33.239> they

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
still air in the football like they

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.940

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
but also the coaching them I don't think

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.649 
but also the coaching them I don't think
I've<00:02:38.099> ever<00:02:38.129> been<00:02:38.280> around<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.670> staff<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.180> has

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
I've ever been around a staff that has

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.720 
I've ever been around a staff that has
three<00:02:40.049> guys<00:02:40.260> you've<00:02:40.680> proven<00:02:41.010> experience<00:02:41.220> as

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
three guys you've proven experience as

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.300 
three guys you've proven experience as
offensive<00:02:42.599> coordinators<00:02:43.290> yourself<00:02:43.799> like

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
offensive coordinators yourself like

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.039 
offensive coordinators yourself like
Sanford<00:02:44.640> who<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.480> offensive<00:02:45.930> coordinator

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
Sanford who is the offensive coordinator

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.170 
Sanford who is the offensive coordinator
in<00:02:46.440> coach<00:02:46.620> filling<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.700> starts<00:02:48.090> with

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
in coach filling I think it starts with

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.000 
in coach filling I think it starts with
the<00:02:48.660> three<00:02:49.170> individuals<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.829> you're

talking about we don't really care about

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.710 
talking about we don't really care about
who<00:02:52.950> gets<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.310> credit<00:02:53.459> for<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:54.239> our<00:02:54.359> office
