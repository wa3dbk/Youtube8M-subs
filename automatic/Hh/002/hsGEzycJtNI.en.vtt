00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello people here is a little again 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.859
 tutorial for industrie ag has the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.929
 Enhancements I said said 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.410
 Coat as you would with a nuclear reactor 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 Well produced I now have one 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 small set up what makes 20 eu that is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.000
 actually a cold runner says so 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.630
 So do not come over the temperature of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320
 0 degrees 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.830
 that a circular setup could do it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.969
 then simply arrange it 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.739
 go through 20 eu and fill yours 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.809
 redbox 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.809
 but what happens the black box 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 then 500 of the further energy is full 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.170
 That's why we have you here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 below you are so normal 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 he wants to see right away 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.350
 work clicked too much it is often one 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.270
 with how many ships redstone signal 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 then the torch goes out that goes out 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 and if you can see who packages from 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.340
 Bank rescue signal is concerned 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340
 he gets here from a torch 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.510
 I think the nuclear reactor actually 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.540
 best because it is so expensive 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 because the recipe has changed and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 1.3 or so from 154 I think so 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.119
 the concept changes and is no more 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.080
 so piggy expensive and is actually 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.290
 to let city 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 but the second best source of energy for 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.000
 The beginning also pretty good if you 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 only materials you need for that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.119
 very clever because stofer place like must 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.800
 a compressor 100 meters works 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.970
 then here 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:47.310
 kenter winter already determines enough 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.930
 generator the battery at the moment 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.370
 shut down because it is full 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.750
 made the pervert out of Bamberg 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:02.310
 like stefan son overclocking two 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.100
 displays the trentmann clock in the all 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.330
 their official and wants seems 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.420
 uranium thing is just a kuranyi im 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.900
 orinoco press tour he gets that yes 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.420
 of course , rihanna jay and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.420
 But you need service 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 city which explained also in there is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.510
 again that's too complicated because 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.910
 either he does that with computer 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.640
 forces or does not create absolutely 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:45.230
 therefore makes it easy to so can 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:45.230
 Of course, now also a signal 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.840
 with the bigger harry valÃ©rien becomes 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.840
 small at the so-called 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.439
 Always double-click because that's how it works 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 strange thing not conciliatory why 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.439
 this is so going with this sensor makes 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.090
 her right goes on it he gets such a 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.510
 map we need to do in here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.040
 so and now you have your character 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.849
 can we do block 1 we can 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.629
 the level is important which maximum 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.150
 and important output is the press name 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:33.870
 this is new block 1 it works 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:37.950
 not that I have enough energy 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.739
 so that has a bit of space again 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.440
 room for energy he shows you to harry 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.109
 mailing two hours 44 minutes and 51 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.500
 seconds of output rapp 20 eu working like me 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.310
 said has a maximum of 10,000 and temperature 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.590
 degree 0 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.819
 I said yes in kalkar setup will be 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.459
 never fly in the air because 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.010
 this sap if you change something i 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.530
 I have another page ran with setups 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.109
 for nuclear it should do the same 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.970
 that flies through the ears then 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.069
 I hope you but I have that 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.150
 tutorial helped because that is really 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.650
 the best energy provider I think 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.650
 and I hope it helped you
