these<00:03:34.319> are<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> kind<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.829> results<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
these are the kind of results that I

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.309 
these are the kind of results that I
want<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.700> see<00:03:35.849> I've<00:03:36.120> loved<00:03:36.329> like<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.959> going

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
want to see I've loved like just going

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.559 
want to see I've loved like just going
off<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.739> causing<00:03:38.069> all<00:03:38.160> kinds<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.489> trouble<00:03:38.569> and

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
off and causing all kinds of trouble and

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.059 
off and causing all kinds of trouble and
looks<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.049> they<00:03:40.139> got<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.290> couple<00:03:40.500> shots<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:40.950> on

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
looks like they got a couple shots in on

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.620 
looks like they got a couple shots in on
me<00:03:41.190> cuz<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.459> got<00:03:41.519> some<00:03:41.700> blood<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.209> concrete

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.339 

unfortunately<00:03:45.630> we<00:03:45.750> don't<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.109> good

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
unfortunately we don't have a good

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.379 
unfortunately we don't have a good
vantage<00:03:46.620> point<00:03:46.859> against<00:03:47.730> these<00:03:47.880> guys<00:03:48.120> cuz

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
vantage point against these guys cuz

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.420 
vantage point against these guys cuz
that<00:03:48.540> gun<00:03:48.720> only<00:03:49.079> goes<00:03:49.290> down<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.829> far<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:50.220> can't

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that gun only goes down so far we can't

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.650 
that gun only goes down so far we can't
arch<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.730> all<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.940> way<00:03:51.030> down<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.419> let's<00:03:51.599> go

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
arch it all the way down so let's go

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.879 
arch it all the way down so let's go
ahead<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.989> lob<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.139> couple<00:03:52.440> grenades<00:03:52.680> down

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
ahead and lob a couple grenades down

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.009 
ahead and lob a couple grenades down
there<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.150> almost<00:03:54.299> essentially<00:03:54.840> just

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
there this is almost essentially just

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.539 
there this is almost essentially just
like<00:03:55.109> using<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.590> grenade<00:03:55.859> launcher<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> guess

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
like using the grenade launcher I guess

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.309 
like using the grenade launcher I guess
except<00:03:57.180> for<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.510> grenade<00:03:57.660> launcher<00:03:57.810> can

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
except for the grenade launcher can

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.410 
except for the grenade launcher can
shoot<00:03:58.530> these<00:03:58.680> things<00:03:58.859> no<00:03:59.040> further<00:03:59.359> but

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
shoot these things no further but

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.390 
shoot these things no further but
it's<00:04:02.020> still<00:04:02.170> fun<00:04:02.440> just<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.770> use<00:04:02.980> my<00:04:03.130> entire

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
it's still fun just to use my entire

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.910 
it's still fun just to use my entire
arsenal<00:04:03.700> across<00:04:04.150> trouble<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.080> it's<00:04:05.710> starting

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
arsenal across trouble and it's starting

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.990 
arsenal across trouble and it's starting
to<00:04:06.010> get<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.130> little<00:04:06.190> serious<00:04:06.610> here<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.820> actually

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
to get a little serious here I actually

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.940 
to get a little serious here I actually
didn't<00:04:07.390> buy<00:04:07.570> body<00:04:07.930> armor<00:04:08.320> before<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.740> whole

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.860 
didn't buy body armor before this whole
thing<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.490> these<00:04:10.090> guys<00:04:10.330> are<00:04:10.540> actually<00:04:10.690> doing

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
kind of don't like how fast other

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.430 
kind of don't like how fast other
helicopters<00:04:40.030> are<00:04:40.240> on<00:04:40.360> scene<00:04:40.750> after<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.230> blow

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
helicopters are on scene after you blow

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.620 
helicopters are on scene after you blow
up<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.710> other<00:04:41.860> ones<00:04:42.100> like<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.210> police

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
up the other ones like the the police

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.900 
up the other ones like the the police
have<00:04:43.870> some<00:04:44.110> endless<00:04:44.530> supply<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.040> helicopters

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
have some endless supply of helicopters

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.730 
have some endless supply of helicopters
I<00:04:46.120> mean<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.570> know<00:04:46.810> it's<00:04:46.960> kind<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.290> fun<00:04:47.500> thing

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
I mean I know it's kind of a fun thing

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.260 
I mean I know it's kind of a fun thing
but<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.280> kind<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.490> silly<00:04:48.669> how<00:04:48.940> fast

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
but I think it's kind of silly how fast

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.270 
but I think it's kind of silly how fast
like<00:04:49.810> they<00:04:49.930> turn<00:04:50.140> around<00:04:50.260> because<00:04:50.680> things

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
like they turn around because things

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.250 
like they turn around because things
seem<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.820> spawn<00:04:52.180> out<00:04:52.419> of<00:04:52.540> nowhere<00:04:52.990> when

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
seem to just spawn out of nowhere when

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.780 
seem to just spawn out of nowhere when
you're<00:04:53.380> not<00:04:53.530> not<00:04:53.800> looking<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.340> game<00:04:54.580> and

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
you're not not looking in this game and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.290 
you're not not looking in this game and
it<00:04:55.419> kind<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.780> detracts<00:04:56.140> from<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.560> overall

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
it kind of detracts from the overall

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.550 
it kind of detracts from the overall
immersion<00:04:58.300> factor<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.840> game<00:04:58.870> not<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.320> say

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
immersion factor of the game not to say

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.170 
immersion factor of the game not to say
this<00:04:59.740> game<00:04:59.919> isn't<00:05:00.130> awesome<00:05:00.580> because<00:05:00.700> I've<00:05:00.970> had

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
this game isn't awesome because I've had

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.510 
this game isn't awesome because I've had
so<00:05:01.630> much<00:05:01.930> fun<00:05:02.230> with<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.590> but<00:05:03.040> there<00:05:03.160> are<00:05:03.190> those

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
so much fun with it but there are those

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.280 
so much fun with it but there are those
small<00:05:03.880> little<00:05:03.910> quirks<00:05:04.510> in<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.720> sandbox<00:05:05.140> and

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
small little quirks in the sandbox and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.409 
small little quirks in the sandbox and
even<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.620> other<00:05:05.740> game<00:05:06.010> suffered<00:05:06.460> from<00:05:06.700> where

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
even the other game suffered from where

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.240 
even the other game suffered from where
you<00:05:08.110> know<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.290> just<00:05:08.440> turn<00:05:08.680> around<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.040> things

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
you know you just turn around and things

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.370 
you know you just turn around and things
are<00:05:09.370> right<00:05:09.669> behind<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.210> as<00:05:10.330> they<00:05:10.479> spawn<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:11.110> so

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
are right behind you as they spawn it so

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.010 
are right behind you as they spawn it so
it<00:05:12.070> definitely<00:05:12.550> has<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:12.760> video<00:05:13.330> game<00:05:13.630> II<00:05:13.660> type

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
it definitely has a video game II type

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.270 
it definitely has a video game II type
feel<00:05:14.320> oh<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:17.050> helicopter<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.680> hard<00:05:17.919> enough<00:05:18.130> to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
feel oh the helicopter is hard enough to

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.130 
feel oh the helicopter is hard enough to
fly<00:05:18.460> after<00:05:18.669> all<00:05:18.850> without<00:05:19.690> running<00:05:19.930> into

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
fly after all without running into

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.570 
fly after all without running into
frickin<00:05:20.650> buildings<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.250> I've<00:05:21.400> already

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
frickin buildings and I've already

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.080 
frickin buildings and I've already
damaged<00:05:22.030> my<00:05:22.120> helicopter<00:05:22.720> which<00:05:22.900> means<00:05:23.229> that

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
damaged my helicopter which means that

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.150 
damaged my helicopter which means that
my<00:05:25.090> time<00:05:25.390> in<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.690> air<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:26.140> somewhat<00:05:26.830> limited

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
my time in the air is somewhat limited

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.650 
my time in the air is somewhat limited
as<00:05:27.640> my<00:05:28.300> engine<00:05:28.450> will<00:05:28.810> eventually<00:05:29.500> fail<00:05:30.660> but

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
as my engine will eventually fail but

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.960 
as my engine will eventually fail but
hey<00:05:32.080> look<00:05:32.350> I've<00:05:32.530> got<00:05:32.740> five<00:05:33.010> stars<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.580> right

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
hey look I've got five stars and right

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.030 
hey look I've got five stars and right
now<00:05:34.120> they<00:05:34.330> don't<00:05:34.510> see<00:05:34.840> me<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:35.290> technically<00:05:35.800> if

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
now they don't see me so technically if

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.250 
now they don't see me so technically if
I<00:05:36.160> laid<00:05:36.490> low<00:05:36.790> right<00:05:37.090> now<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.630> could<00:05:38.080> probably

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
I laid low right now I could probably

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.550 
I laid low right now I could probably
get<00:05:38.680> away<00:05:38.880> but<00:05:39.880> what<00:05:40.390> fun<00:05:40.600> is<00:05:40.720> that<00:05:40.750> you've<00:05:41.410> got

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
get away but what fun is that you've got

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.080 
get away but what fun is that you've got
to<00:05:41.680> actually<00:05:41.979> blow<00:05:42.220> some<00:05:42.430> stuff<00:05:42.640> up<00:05:42.820> because

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
to actually blow some stuff up because

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.179 
to actually blow some stuff up because
that<00:05:43.240> is

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
that is

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.679 
that is
now<00:05:46.189> this<00:05:46.339> is<00:05:46.429> kind<00:05:46.550> of<00:05:46.639> similar<00:05:46.849> to<00:05:47.209> the<00:05:47.659> last

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689 
now this is kind of similar to the last

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.869 
now this is kind of similar to the last
video<00:05:48.229> I<00:05:48.289> said<00:05:48.379> when<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:48.949> was<00:05:48.979> in<00:05:49.309> the<00:05:49.550> fighter

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
video I said when I was in the fighter

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.639 
video I said when I was in the fighter
jet<00:05:50.179> pretty<00:05:50.449> much<00:05:50.599> flying<00:05:50.899> around<00:05:51.139> switching

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:51.649 
jet pretty much flying around switching

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:54.279 
jet pretty much flying around switching
to<00:05:51.770> missiles<00:05:52.129> and<00:05:52.539> blowing<00:05:53.539> up<00:05:53.629> stuff<00:05:53.719> this

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
to missiles and blowing up stuff this

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.799 
to missiles and blowing up stuff this
one<00:05:54.499> I'm<00:05:54.649> actually<00:05:55.119> purposely<00:05:56.119> flying<00:05:56.539> load

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:56.809 
one I'm actually purposely flying load

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.739 
one I'm actually purposely flying load
so<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:57.080> can<00:05:57.289> actually<00:05:57.439> blow<00:05:57.800> stuff<00:05:58.069> up<00:05:58.719> okay<00:05:59.719> I

00:05:59.739 --> 00:05:59.749 
so I can actually blow stuff up okay I

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.079 
so I can actually blow stuff up okay I
got<00:06:00.050> another<00:06:00.080> under<00:06:00.979> the<00:06:01.069> bridge<00:06:01.279> thing<00:06:01.669> I

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
got another under the bridge thing I

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:03.639 
got another under the bridge thing I
haven't<00:06:02.449> actually<00:06:02.779> flown<00:06:02.959> under<00:06:03.110> me<00:06:03.379> a<00:06:03.409> lot<00:06:03.559> of

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:03.649 
haven't actually flown under me a lot of

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:05.859 
haven't actually flown under me a lot of
uses<00:06:03.949> I<00:06:04.219> got<00:06:04.759> to<00:06:04.879> be<00:06:04.969> careful<00:06:05.389> of<00:06:05.479> those<00:06:05.629> palm

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:05.869 
uses I got to be careful of those palm

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:10.600 
uses I got to be careful of those palm
trees<00:06:07.449> well<00:06:08.449> since<00:06:08.899> I'm<00:06:09.110> in<00:06:09.409> this<00:06:09.649> area<00:06:10.159> of<00:06:10.399> the

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
trees well since I'm in this area of the

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.669 
trees well since I'm in this area of the
game<00:06:10.879> I<00:06:11.209> might<00:06:11.479> as<00:06:11.539> well<00:06:11.599> make<00:06:11.899> my<00:06:12.139> way<00:06:12.379> to<00:06:12.439> the

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:12.679 
game I might as well make my way to the

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:15.070 
game I might as well make my way to the
airport<00:06:12.860> as<00:06:13.339> it's<00:06:13.580> really<00:06:13.789> close<00:06:14.149> and<00:06:14.569> maybe

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
airport as it's really close and maybe

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.070 
airport as it's really close and maybe
try<00:06:15.319> to<00:06:15.379> secure<00:06:15.800> another<00:06:16.159> aircraft<00:06:16.479> and<00:06:17.479> then

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
try to secure another aircraft and then

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.839 
try to secure another aircraft and then
ultimately<00:06:18.319> maybe<00:06:18.889> get<00:06:19.129> away<00:06:19.219> we'll<00:06:19.610> see<00:06:19.759> if

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
ultimately maybe get away we'll see if

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.809 
ultimately maybe get away we'll see if
we<00:06:19.939> can<00:06:20.059> survive<00:06:20.209> this<00:06:21.129> this<00:06:22.129> troublemaking

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
we can survive this this troublemaking

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.139 
we can survive this this troublemaking
rampage<00:06:23.509> but<00:06:24.459> it's<00:06:25.459> pretty<00:06:25.639> tough<00:06:25.939> though

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:26.149 
rampage but it's pretty tough though

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:27.669 
rampage but it's pretty tough though
when<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.360> actually<00:06:26.539> have<00:06:26.839> five<00:06:27.050> stars<00:06:27.409> to<00:06:27.589> get

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:27.679 
when you actually have five stars to get

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.439 
when you actually have five stars to get
away<00:06:27.919> because<00:06:28.269> helicopters<00:06:29.269> are<00:06:29.419> just

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
away because helicopters are just

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.779 
away because helicopters are just
spawning<00:06:29.869> all<00:06:30.110> over<00:06:30.289> the<00:06:30.379> map<00:06:30.589> and<00:06:30.919> even<00:06:31.699> if

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
spawning all over the map and even if

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.100 
spawning all over the map and even if
you<00:06:31.879> like<00:06:32.059> go<00:06:32.149> out<00:06:32.240> in<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.419> water<00:06:32.629> they<00:06:32.869> just

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
you like go out in the water they just

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.389 
you like go out in the water they just
appear<00:06:33.559> out<00:06:33.649> in<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.800> water<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.099> as<00:06:34.189> you<00:06:34.279> can

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:34.399 
appear out in the water and as you can

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.100 
appear out in the water and as you can
see<00:06:34.459> I've<00:06:34.669> got<00:06:34.819> like<00:06:34.999> two<00:06:35.449> helicopters

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
see I've got like two helicopters

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.119 
see I've got like two helicopters
following<00:06:36.289> me<00:06:36.559> right<00:06:36.740> now<00:06:36.889> and<00:06:37.039> they're

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
following me right now and they're

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.679 
following me right now and they're
actually<00:06:37.399> shooting<00:06:37.580> me<00:06:37.819> and<00:06:37.909> doing<00:06:38.119> damage<00:06:38.269> to

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
actually shooting me and doing damage to

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.869 
actually shooting me and doing damage to
my<00:06:39.139> helicopter<00:06:39.679> as<00:06:39.830> it's<00:06:40.069> already<00:06:40.279> damaged<00:06:40.819> it

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
my helicopter as it's already damaged it

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.029 
my helicopter as it's already damaged it
I<00:06:40.969> will<00:06:41.119> be<00:06:41.409> probably<00:06:42.409> going<00:06:42.649> down<00:06:42.830> here

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
I will be probably going down here

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.829 
I will be probably going down here
pretty<00:06:43.189> soon<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:44.330> can<00:06:44.360> already<00:06:44.599> hear<00:06:44.779> the

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839 
pretty soon you can already hear the

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:57.010 
pretty soon you can already hear the
motor<00:06:45.110> start<00:06:45.229> to<00:06:45.619> like<00:06:45.769> fail

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.110 

well<00:06:57.590> if<00:06:57.800> I<00:06:57.920> can<00:06:58.100> land<00:06:58.340> this<00:06:58.490> thing<00:06:58.610> in<00:06:58.940> one

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
well if I can land this thing in one

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.660 
well if I can land this thing in one
piece<00:06:59.420> without<00:06:59.930> killing<00:07:00.350> myself<00:07:00.400> I'm<00:07:01.400> gonna

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
piece without killing myself I'm gonna
