00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
we're going to rely on this patch as

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.860 
we're going to rely on this patch as
well<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.759> talents<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.330> glyphs<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.750> them

well as what talents and glyphs on them
I<00:00:15.960> run<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> first<00:00:17.340> thing<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
I run so the first thing that I got to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810 
I run so the first thing that I got to
say<00:00:18.300> before<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.560> started<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
say before we actually get started the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.370 
say before we actually get started the
nerve<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.270> PP<00:00:21.689> power<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.439> something<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.380> kind

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
nerve to PP power is something that kind

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.070 
nerve to PP power is something that kind
of<00:00:25.529> confuses<00:00:26.039> me<00:00:26.189> PP<00:00:26.880> power<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.539> no<00:00:27.840> longer

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
of confuses me PP power is no longer

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.250 
of confuses me PP power is no longer
really<00:00:28.410> even<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> viable<00:00:29.519> stat<00:00:30.390> stack<00:00:30.779> anymore

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
really even a viable stat stack anymore

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.229 
really even a viable stat stack anymore
and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.130> same<00:00:32.279> thing<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.610> resilience

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and the same thing with resilience

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
and the same thing with resilience
because<00:00:33.510> resilience<00:00:34.079> everybody<00:00:34.680> has<00:00:34.800> sixty

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
because resilience everybody has sixty

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
because resilience everybody has sixty
five<00:00:35.250> percent<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.630> didn't<00:00:36.840> even<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
five percent and I didn't even have that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.520 
five percent and I didn't even have that
much<00:00:37.469> last<00:00:37.800> patch<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> PPP<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.290> nerfed

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and this means that all classes are

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
and this means that all classes are
going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.579> stacking<00:00:45.420> their<00:00:45.570> base<00:00:45.750> stats

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
going to be stacking their base stats

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260 
going to be stacking their base stats
and<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:47.039> affliction<00:00:47.430> warlocks<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> means

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
we're going to be stacking intellect and

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
we're going to be stacking intellect and
mastery<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.989> well<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.380> haste<00:00:55.620> haste<00:00:56.220> at<00:00:56.520> after

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you know intellect a mastery so this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.190 
you know intellect a mastery so this
means<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.450> we're<00:01:00.630> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.840> stacking

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
means that we're going to be stacking

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.939 
means that we're going to be stacking
that<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.830> not<00:01:02.040> fully<00:01:03.680> intellect<00:01:04.680> stacked

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that now I'm not fully intellect stacked

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250 
that now I'm not fully intellect stacked
right<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.370> do<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.940> my<00:01:06.210> jewel<00:01:06.810> crafters

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
facet for the plus 320 intellect times

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
facet for the plus 320 intellect times
two<00:01:11.810> but<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> noticed<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.650> been

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
two but I have noticed as I've been

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
two but I have noticed as I've been
replacing<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.880> pupae<00:01:15.270> power<00:01:15.509> jeans<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
replacing my pupae power jeans with

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.540 
replacing my pupae power jeans with
intellect<00:01:16.259> m's<00:01:16.470> I've<00:01:16.979> been<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.490> more

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
intellect m's I've been in a lot more

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.999 
intellect m's I've been in a lot more
dps<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.270> backgrounds<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.440> more<00:01:19.590> dps

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
dps and backgrounds and a lot more dps

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.749 
dps and backgrounds and a lot more dps
in<00:01:20.160> arenas<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:21.509> overall<00:01:22.410> it's<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> give

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
in arenas so overall it's going to give

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.400 
in arenas so overall it's going to give
us<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.030> dps<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:25.410> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> flip<00:01:26.039> side<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
us more dps now on the flip side of that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.610 
us more dps now on the flip side of that
this<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:28.890> similar<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.340> how

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
this is very similar to how

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.740 

classes<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.670> PVE<00:01:33.530> stat<00:01:34.530> stack<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
classes in PVE stat stack so now this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
classes in PVE stat stack so now this
means<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.230> people<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.860> PVE<00:01:38.250> gear<00:01:38.400> because

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
means that people with PVE gear because

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.810 
means that people with PVE gear because
PvE<00:01:39.210> gears<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:39.780> give<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.520> like<00:01:41.520> more

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
PvE gears will give you like more

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.210 
PvE gears will give you like more
intellect<00:01:42.720> more<00:01:43.020> mastery<00:01:43.500> more<00:01:43.800> whatever

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
intellect more mastery more whatever

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.930 
intellect more mastery more whatever
instead<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> pvp<00:01:45.840> power<00:01:45.870> which<00:01:46.440> our<00:01:46.940> gear

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
instead of pvp power which our gear

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.670 
instead of pvp power which our gear
gives<00:01:48.180> us<00:01:48.330> right<00:01:48.510> now<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
gives us right now so this means that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
gives us right now so this means that
people<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.370> are<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.640> PVE<00:01:51.000> gear<00:01:51.120> have<00:01:51.900> been

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
people that are in PVE gear have been

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
people that are in PVE gear have been
doing<00:01:52.440> more<00:01:52.650> dps<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.760> didn't<00:01:54.060> quite

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
doing more dps and I didn't quite

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
doing more dps and I didn't quite
believe<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.870> i<00:01:54.930> first<00:01:55.200> heard<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> from

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
believe that when i first heard it from

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.910 
believe that when i first heard it from
other<00:01:55.800> people<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.400> I've<00:01:57.330> tested<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
other people but I've tested it and it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.790 
other people but I've tested it and it
definitely<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.640> more<00:02:00.510> definitely<00:02:01.290> more<00:02:01.530> more

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
definitely is more definitely more more

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.130 
definitely is more definitely more more

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
blood for by now running I'm about will

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.119 
blood for by now running I'm about will
there's<00:02:53.599> two<00:02:53.780> reasons<00:02:53.959> why<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.319> decided<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.980> go

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
there's two reasons why I decided to go

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.100 
there's two reasons why I decided to go
ahead<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.430> run<00:02:55.519> with<00:02:55.700> them<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:56.030> will<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.840> first

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
ahead and run with them I will the first

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.380 
ahead and run with them I will the first
reason<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.769> glyphis<00:02:58.430> siphon<00:02:58.849> life<00:02:59.030> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
reason is that glyphis siphon life it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.630 
reason is that glyphis siphon life it
works<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.349> a<00:03:00.440> charm<00:03:00.680> now<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.099> very<00:03:01.430> very

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
works like a charm now it's very very

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.180 
works like a charm now it's very very
nice<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.299> lot<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.720> healing<00:03:03.190> spreading

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
dots it's very rewarding and you get a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.229 
dots it's very rewarding and you get a
lot<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.500> passive<00:03:06.950> hills<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.940> kind<00:03:08.120> of

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
lot of passive hills and this kind of

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.030 
lot of passive hills and this kind of
makes<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.659> for<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.989> twenty<00:03:09.530> percent<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:12.140> 22%

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
makes up for the twenty percent that 22%

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.539 
makes up for the twenty percent that 22%
health<00:03:13.310> reduction<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.120> about<00:03:14.840> Willa<00:03:15.170> pliers

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
health reduction that about Willa pliers

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.890 
health reduction that about Willa pliers
so<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:16.700> kind<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.000> helps<00:03:17.209> out<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> lot<00:03:17.420> with<00:03:17.660> fat

so this kind of helps out a lot with fat
now<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:20.720> second<00:03:21.200> reason<00:03:21.319> I<00:03:21.739> went<00:03:22.099> with<00:03:22.250> them

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
done well which is obvious reason is

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.380 
done well which is obvious reason is
that<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.379> can<00:03:24.590> room<00:03:24.739> with<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:25.129> secondary<00:03:25.819> DPS

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
that I can room with a secondary DPS

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.020 
that I can room with a secondary DPS
trinket<00:03:26.840> now<00:03:27.410> this<00:03:27.590> also<00:03:27.799> increases<00:03:28.609> my

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
trinket now this also increases my

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.390 
trinket now this also increases my
healing<00:03:29.329> because<00:03:30.260> its<00:03:30.530> spell<00:03:30.769> power<00:03:30.950> set<00:03:31.280> of

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
healing because its spell power set of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.680 
healing because its spell power set of
creases<00:03:31.700> not<00:03:31.879> only<00:03:32.060> our<00:03:32.180> damage<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:32.599> our

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
creases not only our damage with our

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.410 
creases not only our damage with our
healing<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.769> turn<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.400> also<00:03:34.879> increases

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
healing so in turn this also increases

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
healing so in turn this also increases
our<00:03:35.840> siphoned<00:03:36.290> life<00:03:36.409> healing<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.069> get

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
our siphoned life healing that we get

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.430 
our siphoned life healing that we get
passively<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.359> when<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:38.720> prox<00:03:39.140> we're

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
passively so when this prox we're

how<00:04:18.360> warlocks<00:04:18.780> can<00:04:19.140> used<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.440> play<00:04:19.940> back<00:04:20.940> in

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
how warlocks can used to play back in

how warlocks can used to play back in
Cataclysm<00:04:22.460> previous<00:04:23.460> expansions<00:04:24.170> so<00:04:25.170> that's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
Cataclysm previous expansions so that's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.230 
Cataclysm previous expansions so that's
pretty<00:04:25.890> much<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.190> what<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:26.970> what<00:04:27.150> I've

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
pretty much it what up for what I've

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.350 
pretty much it what up for what I've
changed<00:04:27.660> over<00:04:28.260> all<00:04:28.850> mine<00:04:29.850> with<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> second

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
so now I'm going to go to the part where

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.210 
so now I'm going to go to the part where
I<00:04:36.420> really<00:04:37.380> give<00:04:37.560> my<00:04:37.770> overall<00:04:38.250> pupae<00:04:38.940> review<00:04:39.420> on

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
I really give my overall pupae review on

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.270 
I really give my overall pupae review on
patch<00:04:41.220> 5.3<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:42.660> far<00:04:42.960> what<00:04:43.260> I've<00:04:43.320> done<00:04:43.620> I've

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
patch 5.3 so far what I've done I've

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.520 
patch 5.3 so far what I've done I've
done<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.520> lot<00:04:44.730> of<00:04:44.790> arenas<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.780> past<00:04:46.020> week<00:04:46.290> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
done a lot of arenas this past week and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.070 
done a lot of arenas this past week and
what<00:04:47.100> I've<00:04:47.130> realized<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:47.970> rated<00:04:48.810> game

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
what I've realized is that rated game

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.590 
what I've realized is that rated game
place<00:04:49.380> seems<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.920> be<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.340> lot<00:04:50.730> more<00:04:50.790> balanced

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
place seems to be a lot more balanced

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840 
place seems to be a lot more balanced
than<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.840> was<00:04:52.020> last<00:04:52.050> patch<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.670> great

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
than it was last patch this is great

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.140 
than it was last patch this is great
because<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:55.490> previously<00:04:56.490> when<00:04:56.640> I'm<00:04:56.730> going<00:04:57.030> to

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
because I previously when I'm going to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.200 
because I previously when I'm going to
an<00:04:57.240> arena<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.840> would<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.710> over<00:04:58.890> in<00:04:59.070> seconds<00:04:59.670> now

developing strategies for different

classes and things like that and it
seems<00:05:59.540> to<00:05:59.690> be<00:05:59.780> count<00:06:00.020> boxed<00:06:00.500> right<00:06:00.650> now<00:06:00.800> which

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
seems to be count boxed right now which

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.000 
seems to be count boxed right now which
is<00:06:01.070> unfortunate<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:02.690> have<00:06:03.020> it<00:06:03.170> now<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.710> haven't

comparison<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.830> arenas<00:06:07.310> but<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.740> little

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
comparison to like arenas but a little

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.280 
comparison to like arenas but a little
bit<00:06:09.830> of<00:06:09.950> have<00:06:10.160> done<00:06:10.460> seems<00:06:10.850> to<00:06:11.030> be<00:06:11.150> very

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290

unbalanced<00:06:12.290> and<00:06:12.380> there's<00:06:12.560> still<00:06:12.800> a<00:06:13.040> couple

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
unbalanced and there's still a couple

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.490 
unbalanced and there's still a couple
classes<00:06:14.090> that<00:06:14.510> burst<00:06:14.750> quite<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.050> bit<00:06:15.260> like

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
classes that burst quite a bit like

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.170 
classes that burst quite a bit like
Shannon's<00:06:16.400> and<00:06:16.610> stuff<00:06:16.790> like<00:06:16.940> that<00:06:17.000> and

gameplay<00:06:51.640> but<00:06:52.300> i<00:06:52.420> really<00:06:52.720> really<00:06:52.840> hope<00:06:53.140> that

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440

they<00:06:53.650> work<00:06:54.430> out<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.790> kinks<00:06:54.820> with<00:06:55.240> pvp<00:06:55.570> power

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.480 
they work out the kinks with pvp power
resilience<00:06:56.880> so<00:06:57.880> that<00:06:58.150> will<00:06:58.660> PP<00:06:59.170> is<00:06:59.380> not<00:06:59.770> just

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
resilience so that will PP is not just

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.630 
resilience so that will PP is not just
kind<00:07:01.150> of<00:07:01.270> random<00:07:01.780> dependent<00:07:02.260> you<00:07:02.320> know<00:07:02.640> just

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640
