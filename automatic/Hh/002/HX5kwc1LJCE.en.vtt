00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.910 
transparency if you want to be clear
then<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.599> just<00:02:31.750> go<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.080> 50<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
then you can just go to like 50 and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.350 
then you can just go to like 50 and
it'll<00:02:33.310> make<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.670> clear<00:02:34.560> halfway<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it'll make it clear halfway and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.000 
it'll make it clear halfway and
basically<00:02:37.360> what<00:02:37.660> baffin<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> doing<00:02:38.860> when

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
basically what baffin is doing when

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.410 
basically what baffin is doing when
you're<00:02:39.130> erasing<00:02:39.459> stuff<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.260> picture<00:02:41.260> it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you're erasing stuff on a picture it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.530 
you're erasing stuff on a picture it's
erasing<00:02:43.420> whatever<00:02:43.780> isn't<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.390> bottom<00:02:46.390> one

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
erasing whatever isn't in the bottom one

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780 
erasing whatever isn't in the bottom one
right<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.980> only<00:02:48.070> thing<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.549> isn't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
right here and the only thing that isn't

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.150 
right here and the only thing that isn't
is<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.989> minifigure<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.650> that's<00:02:50.920> what<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
is the minifigure so that's what it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.759 
is the minifigure so that's what it
wants<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.519> erase<00:02:52.019> because<00:02:53.019> if<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.350> erase<00:02:53.590> it

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
wants to erase because if you erase it

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.920 
wants to erase because if you erase it
it's<00:02:53.920> overlaying<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.060> seeing<00:02:55.630> through

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
it's overlaying it just seeing through

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.559 
it's overlaying it just seeing through
into<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.530> right<00:02:57.010> here

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
into this right here

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.270 
into this right here
that's<00:02:59.469> why<00:02:59.650> it's<00:02:59.769> important<00:03:00.129> you<00:03:00.189> don't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
that's why it's important you don't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.629 
that's why it's important you don't
change<00:03:00.579> anything<00:03:01.829> okay<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:02.889> we<00:03:03.310> set<00:03:03.519> the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
change anything okay so we set the

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.819 
change anything okay so we set the
transparency<00:03:03.939> to<00:03:05.849> mmm<00:03:06.849> bout<00:03:06.999> seventy<00:03:07.829> that's

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
transparency to mmm bout seventy that's

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.920 
transparency to mmm bout seventy that's
good<00:03:09.219> and<00:03:10.290> it'll<00:03:11.489> pick<00:03:12.489> up<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.239> minifigure<00:03:13.719> as

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
good and it'll pick up the minifigure as

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.699 
good and it'll pick up the minifigure as
what<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.379> wants<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.680> edit<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.579> there<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
what it wants to edit out of there and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.190 
what it wants to edit out of there and
you<00:03:17.709> have<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.069> eraser<00:03:18.340> selected<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.959> that

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
you have the eraser selected like that

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.129 
you have the eraser selected like that
and<00:03:20.439> you<00:03:20.560> just<00:03:20.680> want<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:20.950> go<00:03:21.400> over<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:22.139> like

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
and you just want to go over it like

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.970 
and you just want to go over it like
that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.920 

just<00:03:29.760> go<00:03:29.970> around<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.659> around

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.679 

it<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.739> change<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.159> transparency<00:03:36.689> to

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
it can change the transparency to

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.240 
it can change the transparency to
however<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.590> want<00:03:39.099> your<00:03:40.000> hologram<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.689> be<00:03:41.250> so

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
however you want your hologram to be so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.550 
however you want your hologram to be so
now<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.489> can<00:03:42.670> see<00:03:42.939> through<00:03:43.239> it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.550 

and<00:03:46.760> what<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:47.910> doing<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.630> erasing<00:03:49.380> or

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and what it's doing it's just erasing or

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.660 
and what it's doing it's just erasing or
fading<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.640> guy<00:03:50.849> out<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.319> see<00:03:52.680> part<00:03:53.610> of

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
fading this guy out so you see part of

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.850 
fading this guy out so you see part of
this<00:03:53.819> right<00:03:54.660> here<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.050> just<00:03:55.380> overlaying

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
this right here this is just overlaying

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.940 
this right here this is just overlaying
and<00:03:56.810> that's<00:03:57.810> how<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.140> make<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.800> can

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and that's how you make it you can

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.760 
and that's how you make it you can
change<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.760> difference<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:00.540> 250<00:04:01.230> that's

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
change it a difference in 250 that's

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.290 
change it a difference in 250 that's
what<00:04:01.920> i<00:04:01.950> did<00:04:02.099> my<00:04:02.310> test<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.849> can<00:04:02.910> make<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
what i did my test you can make it a

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.729 
what i did my test you can make it a
little<00:04:03.660> lighter<00:04:04.849> little<00:04:05.849> not<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.510> faded<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
little lighter little not so faded so it

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.380 
little lighter little not so faded so it
doesn't<00:04:11.010> blend<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.550> with<00:04:11.700> everything<00:04:14.269> but<00:04:15.269> you

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
doesn't blend in with everything but you

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.090 
doesn't blend in with everything but you
can<00:04:15.540> still<00:04:15.780> see<00:04:15.989> it's<00:04:16.169> see-through<00:04:16.410> that's

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
can still see it's see-through that's

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.620 
can still see it's see-through that's
always<00:04:17.820> good<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.680> anti<00:04:20.250> eraser<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.120> just

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
always good and the anti eraser is just

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.180 
always good and the anti eraser is just
restoring<00:04:22.109> everything<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.710> was<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
restoring everything that was in the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.240 
restoring everything that was in the
original<00:04:23.250> one<00:04:23.820> overlay<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.139> erased<00:04:26.840> and
