just don't see the point of it to be
honest<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.460> say<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.000> I've

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the point I think it's waste of a perk

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
the point I think it's waste of a perk
because<00:01:18.750> especially<00:01:19.020> AV<00:01:19.439> sets<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> stuff<00:01:20.159> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
because especially AV sets and stuff it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.999 
because especially AV sets and stuff it
just<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> gates<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:22.009> but

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
just in the gates it's so much but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
just in the gates it's so much but
anyway<00:01:23.549> moving<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.299> perk<00:01:24.689> 2<00:01:24.960> i'm<00:01:25.110> using

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

to realize is that when they lose a lot
of<00:01:35.729> gun<00:01:35.939> fights<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:37.020> have

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079

dexterity<00:01:45.630> which<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
dexterity which is just like the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 
dexterity which is just like the
standard<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:47.610> gun

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
like that it just makes a huge

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
like that it just makes a huge
difference<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.710> anyway<00:01:53.100> cuz<00:01:53.399> i<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.909> want

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.569 
difference to but anyway cuz i just want
to<00:01:54.149> talk<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> gameplay<00:01:54.750> quickly<00:01:55.259> it's

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
to talk about the gameplay quickly it's

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
to talk about the gameplay quickly it's
136<00:01:56.579> 27<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.630> been<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.320> much

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
136 27 but it could have been so so much

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
136 27 but it could have been so so much
more<00:01:58.939> normally<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.450> everyone<00:02:00.630> says

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
more normally I know that everyone says

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.020 
more normally I know that everyone says
that<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.979> much<00:02:02.189> more<00:02:02.250> exciting

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that I could be so much more exciting

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
that I could be so much more exciting
this<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.780> graders<00:02:04.320> gameplay<00:02:04.829> but

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this could be like graders gameplay but

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
this could be like graders gameplay but

here I was so gutted cuz i was on the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.089 
here I was so gutted cuz i was on the
pace<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.399> low<00:02:08.550> 200<00:02:08.940> plus<00:02:09.119> i<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:10.229> 76<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pace for it so low 200 plus i was 76 and

the big part of getting his high game

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900 
the big part of getting his high game
plays<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.530> keeping<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.100> pace<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:36.819> a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
plays is keeping your pace going it's a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.190 
plays is keeping your pace going it's a
shame<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.390> thing<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.930> half<00:02:38.170> time

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
shame is the thing that the half time

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.320 
shame is the thing that the half time
does<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.950> which<00:02:39.519> makes<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.910> hard<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.269> this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
does and which makes it hard in this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.880 
does and which makes it hard in this
game<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.750> super<00:02:41.140> high<00:02:41.290> schools<00:02:41.650> is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
game to get the super high schools is

game to get the super high schools is
because<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.459> does<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.849> knock<00:02:43.030> your<00:02:43.180> pace<00:02:43.330> off

and<00:03:05.290> Xbox<00:03:05.560> Live<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.799> don't<00:03:06.069> think<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.370> hit

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
and Xbox Live I don't think it's hit

and Xbox Live I don't think it's hit
PlayStation<00:03:07.150> yet<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> bullets<00:03:08.590> don't<00:03:08.769> go

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
PlayStation yet but the bullets don't go

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.340 
PlayStation yet but the bullets don't go
down<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.430> fast<00:03:09.610> anymore<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.780> not<00:03:11.080> going

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
down as fast anymore so it's not going

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.960 
down as fast anymore so it's not going
to<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:11.769> many<00:03:11.920> kills<00:03:12.250> at<00:03:12.549> did<00:03:12.760> which<00:03:12.940> is

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
to get you as many kills at did which is

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.880 
to get you as many kills at did which is
a<00:03:13.180> shame<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.080> just<00:03:14.260> gonna<00:03:14.380> make<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.590> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
a shame but it's just gonna make it a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.289 
a shame but it's just gonna make it a
little<00:03:15.040> bit<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.549> much<00:03:15.730> more<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.120> challenge

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
little bit that much more of a challenge

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.099 
little bit that much more of a challenge
to<00:03:16.600> get<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.280> 200-plus<00:03:18.760> gameplays<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.600> I

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
to get the the 200-plus gameplays and I

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.840 
to get the the 200-plus gameplays and I
think<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.440> an-94<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.549> be<00:03:21.609> one<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
think the an-94 is going to be one of

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.090 
think the an-94 is going to be one of
those<00:03:21.940> guns<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.450> you're<00:03:22.600> able<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.650> get<00:03:23.829> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
those guns that you're able to get the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.030 
those guns that you're able to get the
the<00:03:24.850> 200-plus<00:03:25.299> with<00:03:25.600> because<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.980> of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
the 200-plus with because it is one of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.349 
the 200-plus with because it is one of
the<00:03:27.160> best<00:03:27.340> guns<00:03:27.549> in<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> game<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.239> you

this<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.680> one<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.010> my<00:03:45.160> favorite<00:03:45.519> classes<00:03:45.970> and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
this is one of my favorite classes and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.789 
this is one of my favorite classes and
especially<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:47.019> I'm<00:03:47.109> kind<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.350> moving<00:03:47.590> away

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799

from<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.190> foul<00:03:48.489> now<00:03:48.730> because<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.150> got<00:03:49.239> nerfed

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
from the foul now because it got nerfed

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.690 
from the foul now because it got nerfed
which<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:50.769> not<00:03:50.950> really<00:03:51.070> surprised<00:03:51.519> about

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
which I'm not really surprised about

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.509 
which I'm not really surprised about
because<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:53.200> ridiculous<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.040> was<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.250> laser

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
because it's ridiculous it was a laser

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.759 
because it's ridiculous it was a laser
beam<00:03:54.820> were<00:03:55.030> killing<00:03:55.420> two<00:03:55.720> bullets<00:03:56.079> but<00:03:56.709> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
beam were killing two bullets but I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.949 
beam were killing two bullets but I
think<00:03:57.010> if<00:03:57.130> just<00:03:57.340> they've<00:03:57.760> nerve<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.299> foul<00:03:58.540> but

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
think if just they've nerve the foul but

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.650 
think if just they've nerve the foul but
then<00:03:59.109> buff<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.859> SMR<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.790> now<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:00.970> SMR<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.630> a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
then buff the SMR and now the SMR is a

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.680 
then buff the SMR and now the SMR is a
new<00:04:01.900> foul<00:04:02.190> which<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.340> quite<00:04:03.549> funny<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.540> it's

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
new foul which is quite funny and it's

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.080
