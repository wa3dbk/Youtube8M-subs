00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 I want to talk once again about the infinities 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.859
 There are different types of instruments 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 they are the irrationals more than the rational ones 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.260
 the problem is that I'm going to raise now is an interesting problem it's easy to 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.530
 understand you just need to have a little bit of concentration 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.460
 think together with me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.589
 it is possible that there are different types of infinity 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.890
 that could mean different types of credits there are infinities bigger 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.070
 What others 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.890
 and yet even though one suspects the ball 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650
 if it is infinite it is infinite 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.330
 as you can see and finite larger than others 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.680
 however the answer is yes 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.170
 there is a greater instinct than others 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.679
 for example the infinity the irrational pin numbers 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.609
 the largest in quotes that the infinity of rational numbers 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 What does this mean 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.040
 to see if the goal I'm going to stop the detonator so they can accompany me 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.340
 in the path 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.130
 and do not get lost because it's a shame because you learn something 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.630
 but usually ahmad vahidi according to camejo 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.900
 think better 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.770
 suppose I'm not going to say that the numbers are called rational 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 to the numbers that are the quotient of two whole numbers 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.140
 that you want and consciously a divided number another for example three fifths 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 7 90 14 17 years ago it does not matter what all these numbers mean that are 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.520
 the quotient 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.779
 where the integers are what are called rational numbers 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.570
 when one does for example two divided 5 bone two fifths 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 remains at zero point four if one makes one divided 3 josé one third is left 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.300
 zerocoma 33 33 33 this number while never finishing the newspaper in the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 sense that they repeat three 3 3 3 3 3 3 those numbers are called rational 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 the rational rocks only numbers that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.150
 when one does the development of that evil as I just said 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.289
 they have an infinite development but not periodic 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.760
 there is no part that is repeated for example one could have zero coma 4 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.169
 173 474 173 that rational 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.020
 but for example the pin number 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.570
 Després coma 14 15 9 exeter etcetera etcetera that is a number that rational 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.780
 the number the square root fingers 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.200
 what is one coma 41 48 tera that's an irrational number 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.829
 up here we agree 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.770
 rational numbers on the one hand 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.599
 numbers and rational and on the other 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.899
 the question 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.589
 what I want to invite you to think will be more fluid than rationalize the 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.559
 rational 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.030
 the answer 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.510
 beyond giving a rigorous demonstration 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.690
 I'm going to raise the question so that we think in terms of damage 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.539
 stuck but again to essex county faces like when what was worse 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.559
 has numbers that faces from 1 to 6 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.209
 let's assume that these sides 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.300
 they are given that they have ten faces 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.120
 in a number zero neutral act number one number 2 and number three so is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.080
 the number 9 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.549
 they are ten-sided dice 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.470
 However 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.849
 what I'm going to do is start pulling the car 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.549
 and every time a number goes out he wrote it down for example to be 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.470
 the number one third is zero comma 33 33 33 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.760
 what would have to happen 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.760
 I had to throw the body had to leave the 3 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.910
 and again sitting down he has to leave a 3 he scored flooded tirol given he has to 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.299
 leave a 3 they realize that to come out to zero com 33 33 of books and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.040
 newspapers 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.360
 sun every time he has the state he has to give me a 3 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.379
 let's suppose that it has a period that is it eat it 25 twenty-five 25 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.349
 youtube has veto tigers food 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.399
 but again the service what I say what I feel after the 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:58.349
 civic Center 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.069
 josé to every time lotina has to go out to the field that started in 2006 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.399
 each period each of these represents when it is an asset of 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.509
 state has to start repeating 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.089
 indefinitely 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.399
 in what you think will happen 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.539
 they will not be more likely to be used do anything 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.000
 the one that is going to be very difficult is going to give a lot - of those who repeat 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.930
 and effectively this is now cultivation 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.750
 explains why irrational numbers those who do not have a 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.750
 period that never repeats and that continues indefinitely 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.160
 they are much more than the others because even the number for example zero equals 25 that 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.260
 his rational numbers he had to pass 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.760
 I have all sides 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 I want the second b-5 and then it has to come out it's always been done 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.430
 because if not how 25 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.010
 is zero as 27 pursues 0 0 0 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.990
 they realize that it is 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.220
 much smaller the amount of rational numbers 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.969
 that the numbers and rational 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.610
 it's not a demonstration it's just a way of inviting you to think 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.059
 what irrational numbers are many more the infinity of numbers 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.139
 rational is much bigger 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.360
 that of the rational numbers efe 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:17.519
