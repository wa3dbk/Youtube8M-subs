diamond<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.989> players<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> proper

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
diamond one players now have a proper

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
diamond one players now have a proper
place<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.930> opposed<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> our

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
place to go up to as opposed to our

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.099 
place to go up to as opposed to our
challenger<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> prove<00:00:57.570> master

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
challenger and I think that prove master

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
challenger and I think that prove master
it's<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.579> challenger

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's like it's it's not like challenger

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
it's like it's it's not like challenger
we<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> drop<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
we can drop out of it when you get to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
we can drop out of it when you get to
master<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> stainmaster<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
master you know you stainmaster and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
master you know you stainmaster and
that's<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.589> basically<00:01:05.010> does<00:01:05.400> rotations

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that's it and basically does rotations

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
that's it and basically does rotations
of<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.830> into

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of when you can you know get into

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.260 
of when you can you know get into
challenger<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.210> know

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
challenger or not i think you know

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
challenger or not i think you know
that's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.080> works<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.650> don't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that's the way it works like don't

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
that's the way it works like don't
really<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.360> care<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.689> about

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
really don't really care that much about

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
really don't really care that much about
the<00:01:13.380> whole<00:01:13.530> rotation<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> works

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the whole rotation thing or how it works

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.690 
the whole rotation thing or how it works
but<00:01:15.509> anyways<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:17.280> maybe<00:01:17.460> trying

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but anyways I think about maybe trying

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.899 
but anyways I think about maybe trying
to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.150> master<00:01:19.020> myself<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.250> figured<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
to get a master myself but I figured you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
to get a master myself but I figured you
know<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.600> time<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
know don't have enough time for it and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.580 
know don't have enough time for it and
maybe<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.340> enough<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:23.909> Bloods

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
maybe I'm not good enough as well Bloods

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.929 
maybe I'm not good enough as well Bloods
perhaps<00:01:25.590> next<00:01:25.799> season<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.880> about

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
perhaps next season I'm think about

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
perhaps next season I'm think about
maybe<00:01:27.270> I'll<00:01:27.479> try<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.689> go<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.110> I've<00:01:29.100> got

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
maybe I'll try and go for it I've got

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
maybe I'll try and go for it I've got
more<00:01:29.310> time<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.700> hands<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.479> um<00:01:31.009> I'm<00:01:32.009> pretty

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
more time on my hands but um I'm pretty

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
more time on my hands but um I'm pretty
satisfied<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.820> diamonds<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:33.479> it's

about putting videos into 60fps now at
least<00:04:10.480> I'm<00:04:10.630> thinking<00:04:10.959> about<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.850> because<00:04:12.850> I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
least I'm thinking about it because I

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.060 
least I'm thinking about it because I
know<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.209> YouTube<00:04:13.510> supports<00:04:14.140> 60<00:04:14.530> FS<00:04:14.830> now<00:04:15.040> i

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
think i've been using shadowplay

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.199 
think i've been using shadowplay
recently<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.919> video<00:04:18.190> shadowplay<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.060> it's

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
recently and video shadowplay and it's

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.699 
recently and video shadowplay and it's
really<00:04:19.419> good<00:04:19.750> because<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.140> doesn't<00:04:20.410> take<00:04:20.560> as

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
really good because it doesn't take as

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.580 
really good because it doesn't take as
much<00:04:20.919> fps<00:04:21.579> off<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.330> only<00:04:22.510> thing<00:04:22.690> any<00:04:23.200> bad

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
much fps off the only thing any bad

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.930 
thing about it is that it's you can't
really<00:04:26.140> customize<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.919> much<00:04:27.070> but<00:04:27.700> other<00:04:27.880> than
