00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 beautiful only for me today we are here for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 talk about the beat 'em of living 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.230
 excellence is certainly not true 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 many such purists will turn upside down 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 also the nose to see this in a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.779
 retro flash but in the end it is not that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 we only have to talk about pearls 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.920
 videogames but of the games they have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 marked our childhood and this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 at least for me it's one of those 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.489
 we are talking about rival schools united 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.070
 by fire which is the porting of a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.579
 3d fighting game released in the arcade in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 97 and adapted for the playstation 1 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.430
 the game is from the capcom and the story la 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
 history is enough that I do not agree and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.980
 type set in a city ​​in Japan 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 where some strange and mystical events 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.879
 are occurring in all 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.570
 higher education institutions and students 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.579
 they are diva attacked fast 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.380
 and that I know jams and therefore 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.190
 begin pure behaved in a way 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.170
 strange 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.000
 and then what happens happens that yes 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 form five teams with the best 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.610
 fighters from every school to search 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.110
 to understand what the fuck is happening and then 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.640
 you know this is the pretext they start 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.510
 a menasse for this that is not that there 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.030
 makes a lot of sense 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.880
 ok let's talk about the main colleague 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.820
 the arcade in the arcade we can choose i 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.340
 two fighters and the cool is that if 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.350
 we choose two fighters of the di 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 different schools the story will be 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 completely random encounters 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.979
 they will be random and the ending will be 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.759
 generic if we choose two instead 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.160
 fighters from the same school friends 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.950
 we will have a kind of story 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.680
 mode that is with some dialog scenes 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.660
 between the clashes and that is all this there 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.070
 will help hp onwards the characters and the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.770
 story also the character of the characters 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.289
 and navigated and the control system 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.210
 control system is simple though 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.970
 reduced to four keys but what it is like 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 there usually has the capcom is nothing 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.229
 without menamo if menamo azteca if yes 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.229
 fills the bar more the many and more more 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.930
 barrel and every time you use a super 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.620
 move held a small number from the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.510
 bar like all fighting games and the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.180
 secondary character the character 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 secondary is not that type tag ie that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.900
 atac that you can change the game 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.840
 it does only choose which one to start with 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.239
 used and no price we would have some 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.820
 special moves combined with this 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.090
 secondary character is the only way 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.190
 which interacts and some combines mentis 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.920
 or of attack that is secondary character 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.260
 other attacks instead are kind of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.030
 support especially with women ie 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
 come age arms that give i 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 bacetti will hold from magna and tense of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.470
 load the life bar and surfed 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.620
 that is, at least it is different from the usual games 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.110
 fighting graphics and sound not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.000
 they are much or at least that is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.579
 compared to the titles released in that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.920
 period is not that they are all that great though 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.870
 I'm not too bad 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.030
 and yet the characters are cool 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.330
 because they are all characterized with the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.820
 sport tool of you 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.040
 the ball from the balloons the clubs from 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.330
 baseball areas goes well a tried cool 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.180
