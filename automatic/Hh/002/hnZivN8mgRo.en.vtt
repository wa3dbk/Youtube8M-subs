00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.460 
depend also with it is how it is going
to<00:01:34.690> develop<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.890> we<00:01:36.820> expecting<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:38.110> should<00:01:38.260> be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
to develop but we expecting it should be

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.520 
to develop but we expecting it should be
a<00:01:38.500> faster<00:01:38.920> time<00:01:39.130> but<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.940> don't<00:01:40.240> think<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:41.500> are

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
a faster time but I don't think we are

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.430 
a faster time but I don't think we are
going<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.040> water<00:01:42.220> cut<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.360> aim<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.600> to
