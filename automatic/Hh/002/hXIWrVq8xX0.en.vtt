00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 and 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.849
 for today in the art segment in 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.680
 decoration and I say art in decoration 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.110
 because the difference it makes with the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.119
 normal decoration is that they are exclusive 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.770
 and customized in this case we're going to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.750
 see three vases that have textures 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.800
 different models and different and 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.800
 including different colors 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.600
 ricardo avila just invited us if 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 the remodeling of an apartment for 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.370
 leave them as they are welcome well or 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.230
 not here we are trying to put a 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.600
 little bit of add specific functions of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.020
 and what elements are we going to place in this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.850
 space 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.979
 well here we have the protagonist the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.229
 picture remember when we talked the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.940
 issue of fusion when we talked about the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.240
 theme to get all the chromatic quality 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.530
 of the frame in space, that is, all the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990
 elements that we are going to place in the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.720
 space must match the work must 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.640
 make the protagonist not kill her because 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.619
 many times the people in the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.200
 clear spaces that we do it without fault 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.360
 and we put the work of art and we started 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.149
 to place too many foods then 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.530
 the box is left covered opaque of 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.759
 soon when we are in space to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.340
 the 10 minutes we realize that there 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.679
 a picture here not here the idea is that 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.679
 one between and wow the box 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.620
 and bring a sofa based on this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.870
 sofa that makes us contrast we started 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.200
 to get the chromatic quality of the picture 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.740
 with the chair and we have found a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.810
 absolutely spectacular carpet inces 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.210
 super nice and malena all shades 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.940
 of the painting and I notice that it also has 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.100
 plants look with zinc in the bars 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 that is still in the box, not by total 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.990
 the idea is exactly what we have 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.450
 a game is like a game of colors 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.430
 but without leaving the palette that everything 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.820
 coordinate that everything is harmonic 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.680
 balanced and with high aesthetic value 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.190
 how did you do to get it 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.190
 to work 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500
 this time to have weight 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.700
 features first in the art fusion 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 everything you place in space 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.660
 has to have artistic content is 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.740
 craving has to have wealth in design 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.440
 design quality this table was designed 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.390
 for these steps by that for that subject 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.740
 we are next to the stripes the stripes 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.380
 in the box of the 10,000 floor mats 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.480
 then here the geometry is handled or 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.310
 handling a kind of labyrinth if 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.350
 you do not notice the two surfaces of 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.430
 the same are tied with a feat in 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.780
 wood 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.459
 this makes us the mat looks 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.830
 perfectly harmonic and the second 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.230
 point is crystal up and crystal well 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.200
 what transparency and volume before 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.940
 you have a table is artistic in rich of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 see but is not at all to handle 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.410
 a few strokes in wood so 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.480
 delicate you need to have very 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.010
 good design for new so that it does not 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.870
 go to damage it and leave 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.450
 disassemble now well in all the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.340
 head to me it happens to me a lot and that with a 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.100
 good but because those people who carry 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.620
 People who fill the tables with things 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.360
 and in addition to this table that has the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.720
 possibility of filling it because they have 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.670
 between espanyol glass and when you arrive 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.620
 to a house and you find a table like 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 better when you are at home and you 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.300
 lead to a table that has two 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.250
 surfaces the first idea is to mess with 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.780
 Intel stern shape then reaches the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.060
 house and find that they have placed 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.850
 porcelains a vase books down more 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.680
 work books like many things 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.110
 that you'll never ever see two 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.670
 very soft elements one 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.770
 the natural touch that the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.660
 person that each item that you are going to 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.880
 place in the space must have quality 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.400
 or design or material ccoo 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.530
 then here is not a matter 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.080
 a glass vase ricardo I see 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.710
 write down another topic that is the color of the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.690
 wood I think it's very similar to 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.100
 color to white when the frame of 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.200
 then it is integral to integrate some 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.090
 essentially there is a uniformity you do not 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.070
 all the pages of the area of ​​the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.130
 Scissors also handles this 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.400
 a color very honey color good and we have 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.610
 the two very nice accessories I 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.430
 I imagine we put them informal such 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.730
 balanced that is not the center the idea 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.940
 is that as governing the exact table and 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.630
 here we are already driving the touch almost 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.980
 what final and is the color that the cushions 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.170
 we removed the all clear 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.850
 we integrate with a fabric that brings 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.120
 all the tones bring the tones of the 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.470
 carpet also of the eyes of the hour 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.530
 in front of 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.990
 look at yourself the fence even the idea is 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.910
 close because that fabric looks very pretty 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.370
 within the whole environment but lacks 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.790
 something then lacks a companion 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:35.200
 let's place a little bit do not take me out 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:38.130
 just as in the cloth 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.130
 I'm perfect 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.390
 total we are achieving a very 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:48.150
 contemporary a pretty sober space 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.610
 really the average person is not 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.610
 he wants to have a very striking space 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.400
 today at 9 it is currently we have 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.850
 an informal design this modular sofa 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.289
 is part of the current new line 25 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.720
 pretty interesting designs because 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.449
 has an ecological upholstery chest 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.720
 its captained and silo double stitching 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:14.030
 enhances in its modern design also has 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.070
 a box structure bolted with 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.710
 high density foam for greater 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.500
 quality and comfort we also have a 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.470
 super modern center table that has

 three materials the glass the steel and the 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.020
 wood together the two furniture make a 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.570
 pretty comprehensive space with portal and 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.970
