stackable<00:01:23.340> signs<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.630> have

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
stackable signs now we don't have

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
stackable signs now we don't have
stackable<00:01:25.200> signs<00:01:25.380> currently<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.070> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
stackable signs currently now in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
stackable signs currently now in
minecraft<00:01:26.670> xbox<00:01:27.060> 360<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
minecraft xbox 360 which was kind of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.319 
minecraft xbox 360 which was kind of
like<00:01:28.979> her<00:01:29.369> i<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.790> why<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> didn't<00:01:30.210> have

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
like her i don't know why we didn't have

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
like her i don't know why we didn't have
it<00:01:30.420> yet<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.549> have

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it yet but so good to see that we have

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.940 
it yet but so good to see that we have
it<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:32.960> hopefully<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.320> stackable

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it now hopefully we can get stackable

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
it now hopefully we can get stackable
minecart<00:01:35.460> soon<00:01:35.820> or<00:01:36.180> hopefully<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.869> later

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
minecart soon or hopefully in the later

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.969 
minecart soon or hopefully in the later
future<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.920> really

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
future I think that would be really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
future I think that would be really
awesome<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.060> take<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> first

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
awesome so that's my take on the first

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870 
awesome so that's my take on the first
top<00:01:40.049> left<00:01:40.320> picture<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.490> far<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
top left picture as far as the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
top left picture as far as the
Enderdragon<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.290> was

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Enderdragon I think that's what that was

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
Enderdragon I think that's what that was
pretty<00:01:44.130> much<00:01:44.250> mainly<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.850> covers<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> yes

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
pretty much mainly the covers that yes

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
pretty much mainly the covers that yes
we<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.930> getting<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> endo<00:01:46.530> dragon<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.399> go

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
we are getting the endo dragon we can go

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
we are getting the endo dragon we can go
to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> end<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> pretty<00:01:48.540> badass<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to the end and that is pretty badass so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
to the end and that is pretty badass so
let's<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> look<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
let's take a look at the one to the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.149 
let's take a look at the one to the
right<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:51.899> see<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.439> he's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
right as you can actually see that he's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
right as you can actually see that he's
crouching<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.270> believe<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.630> took<00:01:54.810> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
crouching and I believe they took that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
crouching and I believe they took that
the<00:01:55.740> option<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> can't<00:01:57.000> even

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the option out to where you can't even

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
the option out to where you can't even
see<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:57.990> character<00:01:58.380> anymore<00:01:58.560> once<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
see your character anymore once you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
see your character anymore once you
crouch<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.610> think<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.060> took<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.270> option<00:02:00.600> not

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
crouch I think they took that option not

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.870 
crouch I think they took that option not
really<00:02:01.259> sure<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:01.890> 4j<00:02:02.399> Studios<00:02:02.700> did

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
really sure but I think 4j Studios did

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.179 
really sure but I think 4j Studios did
tweet<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> can

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
tweet something about that as you can

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.859 
tweet something about that as you can
see<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.399> way<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:05.729> spawn<00:02:06.270> eggs<00:02:06.479> too<00:02:06.719> as

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
see we have way more spawn eggs too as

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.730 
see we have way more spawn eggs too as
well<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> see<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.069> close

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
well that we can kind of see up close

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.790 
well that we can kind of see up close
um<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.640> better<00:02:10.050> I'm<00:02:11.050> stackable<00:02:11.590> signs

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
um a little better I'm stackable signs

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.790 
um a little better I'm stackable signs
again<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> back<00:02:13.480> behind<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.680> can

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
again and in the back behind as you can

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840 
again and in the back behind as you can
see<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> castle<00:02:15.190> crash<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.610> can<00:02:15.730> actually

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
see the castle crash you can actually

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.510 
see the castle crash you can actually
see<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:17.260> make<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.560> Portal<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.160> we<00:02:18.400> can

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
see that we can make in Portal so we can

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.130 
see that we can make in Portal so we can
actually<00:02:18.640> activate<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.390> importance<00:02:19.900> as<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
actually activate the importance as you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.070 
actually activate the importance as you
can<00:02:20.260> see<00:02:20.380> he<00:02:20.530> put<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:22.450> into<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
can see he put the I actually into the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.930 
can see he put the I actually into the
frames<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.980> there's<00:02:24.220> something<00:02:24.400> really

minecraft xbox 360 and so that's pretty

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.290 
minecraft xbox 360 and so that's pretty
much<00:02:39.070> my<00:02:39.250> take<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.610> top<00:02:39.760> right<00:02:39.940> picture

much my take on the top right picture

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.240 
much my take on the top right picture
that<00:02:40.510> yes<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:40.990> are<00:02:41.080> able<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.440> make<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.800> portals

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
that yes we are able to make in portals

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.420 
that yes we are able to make in portals

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
we can actually go to the end now and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.310 
we can actually go to the end now and
fight<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> end<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.850> Dragon<00:02:46.210> and<00:02:46.450> kill<00:02:46.990> them<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
bottom left picture as you can see he's

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.850 
bottom left picture as you can see he's
holding<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.030> map<00:02:52.270> I'm<00:02:52.990> not<00:02:53.140> really<00:02:53.320> sure<00:02:53.440> what

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
holding a map I'm not really sure what

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.860 
holding a map I'm not really sure what
block<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.460> is<00:02:54.520> or<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.210> is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> block<00:02:55.660> or

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
block that is or if that is a block or

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.470 
block that is or if that is a block or
anything<00:02:56.830> looks<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.430> sand<00:02:57.730> or<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.240> and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
anything looks just like sand or so and

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.300 
anything looks just like sand or so and
as<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.110> can<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.260> there's<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.590> little<00:02:59.830> X<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
as you can see there's a little X on the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.710 
as you can see there's a little X on the
map<00:03:00.340> now<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.820> map<00:03:01.210> looks<00:03:01.420> kind<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.660> weird

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
map now the map looks kind of weird

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200 
map now the map looks kind of weird
maybe<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:02.260> just<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.470> way<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:02.890> designed

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
maybe it's just the way it's designed

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.420 
maybe it's just the way it's designed
maybe<00:03:04.210> it's<00:03:04.390> just<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.990> don't<00:03:05.410> know<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.370> no

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
maybe it's just I don't know I have no

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.700 
maybe it's just I don't know I have no
idea<00:03:06.850> but<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.210> map<00:03:07.360> looks<00:03:07.600> really<00:03:07.900> cool<00:03:08.080> for

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
idea but the map looks really cool for

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.080 
idea but the map looks really cool for
some<00:03:08.950> reason<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:10.120> as<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.020> see<00:03:11.170> there's<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
some reason but as you can see there's a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.090 
some reason but as you can see there's a
X<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.510> map<00:03:13.540> these<00:03:14.350> are<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:14.800> mark

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
X on the map these are actually a mark

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.590 
X on the map these are actually a mark
on<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> map<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.790> mark<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> map<00:03:16.270> shows<00:03:16.330> the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
on the map the mark on the map shows the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.300 
on the map the mark on the map shows the
position<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.590> importer<00:03:18.130> in<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
position of the importer in the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.280 
position of the importer in the
stronghold<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.090> when<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.390> player<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
stronghold and when the player is in the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.310 
stronghold and when the player is in the
end<00:03:20.560> okay<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.130> there<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.880> have<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:22.420> so

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
end okay so there we have it there so

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.110 
end okay so there we have it there so
that's<00:03:23.710> basically<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.550> X<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> map

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that's basically what that X on the map

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.510 
that's basically what that X on the map
is<00:03:25.650> alright<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.770> let's<00:03:26.950> take<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.130> look<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.430> the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
is alright so let's take a look at the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.830 
is alright so let's take a look at the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.219 
so those are probably three new items

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.469 
so those are probably three new items
that<00:04:19.340> we're<00:04:19.489> getting<00:04:19.579> but<00:04:20.180> wait<00:04:20.329> would

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
that we're getting but wait would

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.119 
that we're getting but wait would
actually<00:04:20.780> place<00:04:20.959> picture<00:04:21.349> frames<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.799> you

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:22.129 
actually place picture frames and you

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.290 
actually place picture frames and you
can<00:04:22.280> actually<00:04:22.430> see<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.819> we're<00:04:22.939> able<00:04:23.090> to

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
can actually see that we're able to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.749 
can actually see that we're able to
shoot<00:04:23.479> water<00:04:23.780> out<00:04:24.349> of<00:04:24.409> the<00:04:24.650> dispenser<00:04:25.159> I<00:04:25.370> think

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
shoot water out of the dispenser I think

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:26.950 
shoot water out of the dispenser I think
they're<00:04:25.879> kind<00:04:26.029> of<00:04:26.060> prepping<00:04:26.419> us<00:04:26.539> up<00:04:26.659> for<00:04:26.840> that

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
they're kind of prepping us up for that

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.239 
they're kind of prepping us up for that
because<00:04:27.110> we<00:04:27.409> will<00:04:27.590> be<00:04:27.680> able<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.860> shoot<00:04:28.009> fire

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:28.249 
because we will be able to shoot fire

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.339 
because we will be able to shoot fire
charges<00:04:28.669> out<00:04:28.789> of<00:04:28.939> the<00:04:29.029> dispenser<00:04:29.539> and<00:04:29.689> it's

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
charges out of the dispenser and it's

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.600 
charges out of the dispenser and it's
just<00:04:30.529> going<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.680> be<00:04:30.740> great<00:04:31.069> now<00:04:31.219> it<00:04:31.370> looks<00:04:31.490> like

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
just going to be great now it looks like

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.820 
just going to be great now it looks like
there's<00:04:31.909> something<00:04:32.150> growing<00:04:32.710> under<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
there's something growing under the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.450 
there's something growing under the
water<00:04:34.039> but<00:04:34.279> I<00:04:34.340> have<00:04:34.490> really<00:04:35.180> no<00:04:35.210> clue<00:04:35.569> and

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
water but I have really no clue and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.040 
water but I have really no clue and
that's<00:04:37.460> just<00:04:37.699> pretty<00:04:38.029> much<00:04:38.300> my<00:04:38.509> take<00:04:38.749> on<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that's just pretty much my take on the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.709 
that's just pretty much my take on the
last<00:04:39.259> picture<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.159> believe<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:40.909> I<00:04:40.969> not<00:04:41.479> sure<00:04:41.629> if
