00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 hello and swami business today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 I will show a very interesting bug that 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 adds poppies something not at all 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.450
 given and so before the start we will do 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.990
 come down to earth and he'll show 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 detailed and understandable so that we have 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 There is a carbon and one more 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 coal ore and now i think some 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.009
 not everyone will understand and so take the diamond 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 pickaxe in hand and both omoz now you for sure 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.010
 did not understand and now see here 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 I will sleep a little and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 and here, too, diamond up dear friends here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 so easy and simple but if we are super 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.230
 I will believe that I did not understand the texture 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.210
 this idiot mode and please coal 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.969
 please diamonds well and still now 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 I will show how it all and what is what and so 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.130
 what do we need at all we 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 will need Peter's court set 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.830
 like that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:23.670
 scheme to constantly ticked 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:32.329
 in such a simple way does not want to tick 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.329
 and here the delay is worth it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.609
 then we are related somewhere here 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 we put our expensive piston on some 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.869
 time off it and so what we need 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.899
 departing from the block 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.729
 Well, so many blocks, that is, 2 activating 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.709
 piston 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:03.789
 we begin to set let's say this block 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:12.430
 our ice is all now remove these two blocks 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:14.560
 and remove the creative world pickaxe and if we 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.769
 This is not the first time, then we have everything 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 spoil and so here on we got 1 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.890
 Tom 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.480
 Here is such an interesting bug with me 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.780
 that's why there is an old skin 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.459
 and on this i can say touch friends 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.609
