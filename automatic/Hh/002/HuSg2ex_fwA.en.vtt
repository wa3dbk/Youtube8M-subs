00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
inside it's a 2600 milliamp hour battery
and<00:00:25.320> initially<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> little<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.880> worried

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and initially I was a little bit worried

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.700 
and initially I was a little bit worried
how<00:00:27.449> would<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> battery<00:00:28.230> life<00:00:28.380> because

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
how would be the battery life because

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.089 
how would be the battery life because
this<00:00:29.400> desire<00:00:29.730> 8<00:00:29.910> 1<00:00:30.210> 6<00:00:30.510> sports<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.410> 5.5<00:00:32.070> inch

screen but I'm happy to say that the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.630 
screen but I'm happy to say that the
battery<00:00:34.590> life<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.040> getting<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
battery life that I'm getting on this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000 
battery life that I'm getting on this
device<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.780> good<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.380> did<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:37.980> my

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
device is pretty good I did all my

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.240 
device is pretty good I did all my
testing<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.270> single<00:00:39.600> sim<00:00:40.250> because

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
testing with just a single sim because

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
testing with just a single sim because
this<00:00:41.520> desire<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.329> 1/6<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.110> Indian<00:00:43.469> model<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this desire it 1/6 the Indian model that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
this desire it 1/6 the Indian model that
we<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:43.980> getting<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> dual<00:00:45.059> sim<00:00:45.300> model<00:00:45.629> but

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
we are getting is a dual sim model but

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.950 
we are getting is a dual sim model but
both<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> Sims<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.250> nano<00:00:47.940> SIM<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.690> just

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
both the Sims are nano SIM and I just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
both the Sims are nano SIM and I just
had<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.590> nano<00:00:49.950> SIM<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.000> biggest

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
had one nano SIM and the biggest

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
had one nano SIM and the biggest
striking<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.590> device<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
striking thing about this device is that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.200 
striking thing about this device is that
the<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.210> SIM<00:00:54.480> slot<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.199> accept<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> GSM<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the first SIM slot can accept a GSM or a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.950 
the first SIM slot can accept a GSM or a
CDMA<00:00:57.809> SM<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:58.949> sim<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> GSM<00:01:00.600> cell<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
CDMA SM the second sim is GSM cell and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560 
CDMA SM the second sim is GSM cell and
this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> microSD<00:01:02.309> card<00:01:02.520> slot<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this is for the microSD card slot so I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
this is for the microSD card slot so I
did<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.019> testing<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.769> single<00:01:04.979> cell

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
did all my testing with this single cell

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.350 
did all my testing with this single cell
that<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.820> gsm<00:01:06.360> 3g<00:01:06.510> enabled<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.360> let's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that is on gsm 3g enabled and let's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
that is on gsm 3g enabled and let's
unlock<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> device<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.280> would<00:01:11.640> say<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
unlock the device and I would say the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
unlock the device and I would say the
battery<00:01:12.060> life<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.840> getting<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> pretty

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
battery life I was getting is pretty

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.429 
battery life I was getting is pretty
good<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> easily<00:01:14.970> last<00:01:15.299> over<00:01:15.659> 24

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
good and it can easily last over 24

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.679 
good and it can easily last over 24
hours<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> moderate<00:01:18.000> usage<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
hours with the moderate usage with a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.039 
hours with the moderate usage with a
single<00:01:19.170> sim<00:01:19.820> also<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> standby<00:01:21.299> life<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
single sim also the standby life that I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
single sim also the standby life that I
was<00:01:22.259> getting<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.830> device<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.670> good

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
was getting on this device is very good

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
was getting on this device is very good
so<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.180> terms<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> battery<00:01:24.720> life<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so in terms of battery life this is a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.999 
so in terms of battery life this is a
good<00:01:26.250> device<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.299> coming<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.829> thing

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
good device now coming to one more thing

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.510 
good device now coming to one more thing
that<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.990> sim<00:01:30.990> slots<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.220> very

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that is the sim slots it is very

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
that is the sim slots it is very
interesting<00:01:32.850> let<00:01:33.329> me<00:01:33.450> show<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> same

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
interesting let me show you the same

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
interesting let me show you the same
again<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.220> dual<00:01:35.430> network<00:01:35.850> manager

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
again we have dual network manager

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
again we have dual network manager
because<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> dual<00:01:36.960> SIM<00:01:37.200> device<00:01:37.310> again<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because it's a dual SIM device again I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
because it's a dual SIM device again I
have<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.970> sim<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.780> 10<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
have this one sim that's a 10 right now

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.330 
have this one sim that's a 10 right now
but<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> mobile<00:01:42.720> data<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
but if we go to the mobile data and it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
but if we go to the mobile data and it
has<00:01:44.490> automatically<00:01:45.000> selected<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.570> slot<00:01:45.840> 1

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
has automatically selected the slot 1

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.450 
has automatically selected the slot 1
because<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> only<00:01:46.649> sim<00:01:46.950> card<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.280> have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
because that's the only sim card we have

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.200 
because that's the only sim card we have
