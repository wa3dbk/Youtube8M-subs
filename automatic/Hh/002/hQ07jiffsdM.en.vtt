 loss of hair it occurs 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.260
 mainly due to the connection of dht 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.090
 at its androgenic receptor in the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 hair follicles or if you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 then uses a competitor of hp for 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.070

 metabolic and thousand fibrillar tensional puri 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.860
 but I have seen famous people posting that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.979
 It has nothing to do with your opinion. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.649
 has nothing to do 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.329

 because now I have 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.580
 I already spoke there in the first video and 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.910
 new this kind of question is not legal to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.890
 people to discuss olive tree is not only 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:28.170
 having to select the questions have 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:29.820
 many short questions won a 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.070
 person with problems like depression you 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.670
 sees hormones as a period for this 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.140
 dear person maybe worse than not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.060
 only depression such as anxiety and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.860
 obsessive compulsive disorders 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 I was aware of a case of a guy who 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.090
 I wanted to ask you your opinion on 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.120
 Yes, there are a lot of drugs. 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.070
 there anabolic androgenic who served 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.210
 directly in the modulation of several 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.980
 neurotransmitters 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.660
 I myself think I made one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.990
 a long time ago I had to see 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.960
 that there was no such action 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:09.150
 which in the case of the canvas for example 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.160
 Iperó activate the microbe and this 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.040
 would lead to a fall in levels of 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.500
 serotonin would be one of the reasons for 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.560
 person has depressive symptoms in the use of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.350
 Bolderona is neither talking nor talking 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.180
 rangel kamers I always make my case 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.040
 one hour before fasting fall because 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.380
 say that after six hours of play you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.480
 burns 100 percent fat because its 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.840
 respiratory process is very low in 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.489
 around 0 17 is correct good embrace 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.600
 home review what is the coefficient 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.780
 respiratory rate is a rate of how much 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.110
 you substrate burn by volume of 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.000
 oxygen captured right then you got there 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.980
 some values ​​in which you have 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.890
 maximization of burning of certain 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.459
 substrates below zero 7 actually is 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.970
 It's just fat basically I think until 08 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.420
 protein and above that is carbohydrate 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.940
 only that of the coefficient 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.250
 the barrel of the net does not live 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.260
 would be very easy to eat and the probe 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.440
 terminal of the type of food would 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.380
 trainings basically grew metabolic 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.829
 low intensity and it is not the mayor 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.400
 practice at match 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.840
 beauty rafael nato as coach athlete with 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.550
 your opinion the general understanding in 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 relationship requires you to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.360
 able to associate with its criteria 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.520
 required to share with the crew 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.830
 think of competing his vision on the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.229
 and if you think about slapping the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:44.050
 wig and fall to her future is in 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.680
 my hair girls second kara men 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.460
 izik is one thing that heard the andré bagé 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.129
 speak on a course that made a thesis that is 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.139
 that guy I'd hire to be 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:59.500
 the handsome man who would dance with my daughter 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.629
 on her 15-year-old party or the guy 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.210
 that we see in the Czech magazine bill 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:09.639
 ward or in that magazines flow coming out 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.479
 of water carrying a surfboard that is a 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.120
 example 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.180
 a guy who has two helmets in place 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.870
 of the shoulders a dorsal one that looks like a wing 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.699
 delta 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.689
 he is an amateur wiki can not be a 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.610
 professional 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.159
 I suggest then that these physical means 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.800
 here in brazil they are still there to 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.229
 out 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.219
 birth still does not find anything valid 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:40.930
 make a cycle that thinks blast cross is 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:46.270
 The ideal I always did cycle etpc until three 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.979
 years ago go got it in 340 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.080
 interrupted forever or intermittently if 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.639

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.789

 It's Monday, I do not think you're cool. 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.940
 direct then do it intermittently 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.139
 advantage / disadvantage to be made in 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.849
 four and doctor 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:08.949

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:10.539
 different eduardo arm for those who do not 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.099
 think about having children and will remain in 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.409
 low including that of cgtp 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.979
 benefit you usually pass on to your 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:21.430
 students and even the ones using cross 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:25.740
 one day only for some 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.810
 students who make a point and make use of 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.300
