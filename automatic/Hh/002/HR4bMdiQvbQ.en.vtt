00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
to point out to me that my audio levels

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.690 
to point out to me that my audio levels
are<00:00:26.930> occasionally<00:00:27.529> dipping<00:00:28.040> and<00:00:28.250> then<00:00:28.430> coming

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700

are occasionally dipping and then coming
in<00:00:28.910> hard<00:00:29.439> depending<00:00:30.439> on<00:00:30.710> when<00:00:30.919> it<00:00:31.009> gets<00:00:31.160> quiet

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
in hard depending on when it gets quiet

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.340 
in hard depending on when it gets quiet
and<00:00:31.730> when<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.060> start<00:00:32.509> talking<00:00:32.689> again<00:00:33.020> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
and when I start talking again and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.840 
and when I start talking again and
that's<00:00:33.470> because<00:00:33.650> every<00:00:34.340> once<00:00:34.370> in<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.670> while<00:00:34.820> I

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
that's because every once in a while I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.810 
that's because every once in a while I
use<00:00:35.180> an<00:00:35.810> astro<00:00:36.320> a50<00:00:36.680> headset<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:37.550> i<00:00:37.610> just

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
use an astro a50 headset that i just

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.020 
use an astro a50 headset that i just
bought<00:00:38.300> is<00:00:39.079> not<00:00:39.320> sponsored<00:00:39.650> a<00:00:40.220> week<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:40.970> a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
bought is not sponsored a week and a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.290 
bought is not sponsored a week and a
half<00:00:41.060> ago<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:43.190> has<00:00:43.370> kind<00:00:43.760> of<00:00:43.790> an<00:00:43.910> automatic

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
half ago and it has kind of an automatic

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.050 
half ago and it has kind of an automatic
gate<00:00:44.840> release<00:00:45.140> system<00:00:45.560> I<00:00:46.040> think<00:00:46.370> unless<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:46.940> can

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
gate release system I think unless I can

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.490 
gate release system I think unless I can
go<00:00:47.180> in<00:00:47.300> there<00:00:47.450> on<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.660> drivers<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:48.170> tweak<00:00:48.350> it

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
go in there on the drivers and tweak it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400 
go in there on the drivers and tweak it
but<00:00:48.880> for<00:00:49.880> now<00:00:50.000> I<00:00:50.030> think<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.840> audio<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.170> still

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
but for now I think the audio is still

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.810 
but for now I think the audio is still
bearable<00:00:51.710> I'm<00:00:52.070> pretty<00:00:52.310> sure<00:00:52.490> you<00:00:52.640> guys<00:00:52.700> can

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
bearable I'm pretty sure you guys can

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.930 
bearable I'm pretty sure you guys can
understand<00:00:53.390> everything<00:00:53.630> I'm<00:00:53.870> saying<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.940> I'm

this game if you're just starting out
this<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:24.860> kind<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.190> prime<00:01:25.400> example<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:26.120> of

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
this is kind of a prime example here of

what I'm going to be talking about today
which<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.120> main<00:01:29.270> differences<00:01:29.690> between

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
which is the main differences between

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.050 
which is the main differences between
Crysis<00:01:31.010> 2<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.220> Crysis<00:01:31.490> 3<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.790> if<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.940> guys

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
can notice I'm holding the objective by

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.370 
can notice I'm holding the objective by
just<00:01:34.250> constantly<00:01:35.030> hopping<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.630> those<00:01:36.170> two

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
just constantly hopping and those two

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.230 
just constantly hopping and those two
bars<00:01:36.620> on<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> bottom<00:01:37.190> right<00:01:37.340> hand<00:01:37.400> side<00:01:37.850> of

bars on the bottom right hand side of
the<00:01:38.330> screen<00:01:38.420> they<00:01:38.750> measure<00:01:39.080> your<00:01:39.320> armor<00:01:39.800> and

the screen they measure your armor and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.469 
the screen they measure your armor and
then<00:01:40.130> your<00:01:40.250> energy<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.880> bottom<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.330> your

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
then your energy on the bottom so your

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.390 
then your energy on the bottom so your
armors<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> wider<00:01:42.229> line<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.740> then<00:01:42.860> your

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
armors the wider line and then your

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.630 
armors the wider line and then your
energy<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:45.320> line<00:01:45.500> below<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
energy is the the line below that and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.920 
energy is the the line below that and
then<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.090> top<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.420> every<00:01:47.630> time<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.810> use

then on top of that every time you use
nano<00:01:48.229> vision<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> bar<00:01:49.610> that

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
nano vision here you have a bar that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.420 
nano vision here you have a bar that

happen<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:39.930> inconsistency<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:40.980> really<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
happen is inconsistency when really you

happen is inconsistency when really you
really<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.590> take<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.890> time<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.750> approach
