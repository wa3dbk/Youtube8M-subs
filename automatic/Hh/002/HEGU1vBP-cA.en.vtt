I<00:02:15.780> already<00:02:16.050> input<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> coding<00:02:16.950> I'm<00:02:17.100> just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
I already input the coding I'm just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.600 
I already input the coding I'm just
showing<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.030> an<00:02:18.150> example<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:19.020> how<00:02:19.320> oh<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610

know<00:02:20.730> where<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.180> find<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> code<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
know where you can find the code you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.410 
know where you can find the code you
know<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.630> slim<00:02:24.630> jim<00:02:25.190> code<00:02:26.190> make<00:02:26.850> sure<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.240> get
