to his confidence to be honest and he's
gotta<00:02:58.200> pick<00:02:58.470> himself<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:58.980> look<00:02:59.549> himself

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
gotta pick himself up look himself

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.940 
gotta pick himself up look himself
analyze<00:03:00.900> where<00:03:01.140> he<00:03:01.319> went<00:03:01.440> wrong<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
analyze where he went wrong and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.620 
analyze where he went wrong and
hopefully<00:03:02.430> he'll<00:03:02.819> come<00:03:03.060> back<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.239> stronger

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
hopefully he'll come back a stronger

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.880 
hopefully he'll come back a stronger
play<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:03.930> he<00:03:03.989> has<00:03:04.110> been<00:03:04.140> planning<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:04.709> four

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
play and he has been planning all four

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.350 
play and he has been planning all four
games<00:03:05.130> recently<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.790> he<00:03:05.880> might<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.090> down<00:03:06.209> to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
games recently so he might be down to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.509 
games recently so he might be down to
fatigue<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:06.959> think<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:07.950> should<00:03:07.980> rest<00:03:08.280> him

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
fatigue and I think we should rest him

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.640 
fatigue and I think we should rest him
in<00:03:08.850> our<00:03:09.120> son<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.540> game<00:03:09.750> nonetheless<00:03:10.470> the

in our son the game nonetheless the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.920 
in our son the game nonetheless the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.830 
didn't prove was too much of a downer
and<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:14.820> could<00:03:14.970> tune<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.299> play<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.720> the
