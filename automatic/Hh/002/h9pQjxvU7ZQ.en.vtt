the thing where it would be stuck on the
I<00:01:03.120> BBS<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> issue<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> lot

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
I BBS and I know this is the issue a lot

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
I BBS and I know this is the issue a lot
of<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:07.110> viewers<00:01:07.140> had<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> do

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
of our viewers had so just if you do

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
of our viewers had so just if you do
this<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:10.560> over<00:01:10.590> again<00:01:10.920> you'll

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this if you do it all over again you'll

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
this if you do it all over again you'll
get<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> new<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> booty<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.930> hopefully

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
get a new I booty which will hopefully

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
get a new I booty which will hopefully
work<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.090> wait<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
work if not you could just wait for the
