four<00:03:01.530> stages<00:03:01.889> that<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.549> through<00:03:02.579> here<00:03:03.090> in

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
four stages that we go through here in

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
four stages that we go through here in
the<00:03:03.299> machining<00:03:03.750> op<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.530> complete<00:03:04.919> an<00:03:05.099> upper

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
and in between each operation we like to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.649
