00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.610 

and<00:02:13.849> after<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.540> would<00:02:14.689> open<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.109> up<00:02:15.200> but

right now I already have it installed so
it's<00:02:17.329> best<00:02:17.659> why<00:02:17.870> it's<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.139> opening<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:20.239> and

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109
