00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 we find ourselves today for one eye 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.920
 boxing of my screen the asus vg 248 cu the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 so it's a 3d screen that likes a rate 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 of refreshment of 1 a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.980
 millisecond so very fast that makes 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.859
 finally it's a 3d full hd led screen that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 has two speakers and angry who 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 would have them especially vertically or 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.110
 horizontally 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:39.510
 it's as you like after so 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.030
 it has a rate of hertz 215 244 that's at 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 say a super fluid image so for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 people who play video games 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 like me it's a set a benefit and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 even for me a trick anyway that is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.539
 primordial primordial because it's 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.170
 still nice enough to have a picture 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 a fluid image and a game that does not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.240
 do not fit in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:14.159
 the cardboard we had a doctor of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.979
 manual foot what to pack too who 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 is pivotable thanks to a disc that is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.210
 of his and a very nice finish with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 the small 3d before that of 750 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.490
 copy a little we had a cap 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.020
 audio 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.710
 a cable to like the power cable 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 and the installation cd 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:47.159
 after behind the worse foot at the tables 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.020
 as I told you that link with the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.869
 little ones with the little son plunged 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.220
 wedges very friendly 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.890
 behind we have a jack for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.479
 connecting a non headphone jack 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.399
 plug in this little camp whose for for 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.390
 have blood on the screen so that can 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.190
 to be and know when we watch a movie 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.450
 or with friends like that when we have 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.840
 not fifty thousand helmets in favor 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:21.959
 from taking a hdmi to taking a dvi and that's it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 here to eat the food and of 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.230
 under we have it's not it should have been 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.410
 see 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.310
 but all the little buttons so lit 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 after we have all the little ones 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.730
 settings finally here is so it's up to 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.040
 the screen that seems very nice to me 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.079
 so it's 24 inches for me it's 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.519
 largely enough next 27 it's too much 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.930
 big and a smaller loan it's not 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.760
 very nice we still prefer to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.299
 sell a game that is still pretty 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.220
 big and clear enough so here is 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.890
 not see directly I like when 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.810
 even the speakers so leader is at 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.040
 interior 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 but in any case at first sight it's a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.870
 screen that is very nice that is 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.180
 very nice to see but I was finally told 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.160
 is my life I have watched several 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.260
 sites and in the wise comments 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
 that as you will light it will be 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.850
 very bright so there will be several 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.799
 settings to do so to adjust the 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.440
 brightness the contrasts be like that 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.389
 and after that you will have a perfect picture 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.260
 so for the game it's nickel 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.640
 after 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 behind all the hostesses of my pc 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:36.260
 it will be for a going to pump his strings and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.349
 there will be a video that will stay on 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.430
 our channels video editing this pc 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.160
 in question is normally it will be done 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.930
 on my channel towards Sunday morning 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.299
 so to do that interests you 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.180
 can go for a ride and that's me 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.180
 great pleasure here go go bye
