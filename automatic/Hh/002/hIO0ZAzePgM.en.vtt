00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello today we have such a girl 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.119
 design using stamping with 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.699
 stamping is easy and simple to make a design 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.650
 equally good on both hands if you 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.810
 interesting stay with me nails on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 index finger and little finger I already 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 covered with this beautiful lilac varnish and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.419
 Only razon on the remaining three from me 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.579
 dad just base my favorite number 423 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.340
 for today's design I will 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.850
 use tile fan threat for your 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 nails 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.460
 and engine soft stamp to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.399
 minimize time which is usually 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.890
 spent on wiping the skin around the nails 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.449
 after design I will use protection 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 for cuticle 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.210
 from kaleidoscope for stemping using 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 white paint from 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.399
 kaleidoscope I already said that for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 stamping can use any varnish and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.010
 and stamped a and oops oh 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.329
 and dance legend and the only difference 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.090
 for stamping they are more 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.370
 pigmented and the design will be brighter and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 sharper and better visible paint 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:19.060
 we remove everything only by light rolling 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.620
 move the paint onto the stamp 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.440
 transfer the image from the stamp to the nail 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.120
 trying to print all areas of the nails 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.070
 and now the second nail 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.070
 now remove the protection 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.880
 stamping until we finish dries 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.540
 design on the index finger and little finger 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.350
 as you remember on those nails I have 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.070
 the tracks will use white lacquer and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.070
 tiny dogs 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.400
 and when the stamping is a little dry 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.950
 paint over half of the nail for this 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.890
 you can use tape or you can 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.290
 do it come on stamping I'm not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 put the top well enough high 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.670
 not ripped off 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.710
 sticky tape I have this 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 magic box which is always 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.030
 is on my desktop here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 how do you see mixed different rhinestones 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.420
 decorations of different colors and sizes 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.280
 further it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 rhinestones which i will use 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 re thousand when i take off the design and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.880
 rhinestones are not clouded not dirty water 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.350
 and look good I fold them 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.890
 magic box and can use 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.870
 repeat them who else does so share 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.620
 with me in the comments not giving varnish 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.740
 dry out 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.870
 we put on rhinestones 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.870
 rivets fit anything 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.500
