for<00:03:39.410> another<00:03:39.530> flash<00:03:40.040> cannon<00:03:40.310> let's<00:03:40.489> hope<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
for another flash cannon let's hope it

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.120 
for another flash cannon let's hope it
doesn't<00:03:40.940> get<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.120> special<00:03:41.450> d<00:03:41.540> drop<00:03:42.130> which

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
doesn't get a special d drop which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.070 
doesn't get a special d drop which
doesn't<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.570> what's<00:03:44.720> coming<00:03:44.989> now

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
doesn't get and what's coming now

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.320 
doesn't get and what's coming now
obviously<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.620> full<00:03:45.799> restore<00:03:46.209> she's<00:03:47.209> going

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
obviously is a full restore she's going

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.520 
obviously is a full restore she's going
to<00:03:47.390> go<00:03:47.450> ahead<00:03:47.570> and<00:03:47.690> use<00:03:47.900> that's<00:03:48.110> not<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> problem

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
to go ahead and use that's not a problem

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.289 
to go ahead and use that's not a problem
at<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.830> because<00:03:49.070> once<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.730> drain<00:03:49.970> punch<00:03:50.150> him

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
at all because once I drain punch him

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.750 
at all because once I drain punch him
again<00:03:50.480> he's<00:03:50.630> gonna<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:50.870> put<00:03:50.989> down<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.290> study

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
again he's gonna be put down to a study

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.130 
again he's gonna be put down to a study
anyway<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.870> mean<00:03:54.200> it's<00:03:55.040> not<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.190> problem<00:03:55.519> I

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
anyway so I mean it's not a problem I

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.360 
anyway so I mean it's not a problem I
don't<00:03:57.140> want<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.320> waste<00:03:57.350> all<00:03:57.650> my<00:03:57.709> dream<00:03:58.010> punches

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
switch it up and go for crunch am i

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.199 
switch it up and go for crunch am i

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
full restore us absolutely fine once

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.140 
full restore us absolutely fine once
again<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.769> mean<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> crunch<00:04:07.280> won't<00:04:07.610> break

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
again I mean the crunch won't break

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.640 
again I mean the crunch won't break
we'll<00:04:08.480> break<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.780> sturdy<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.440> it's<00:04:09.560> gonna

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
we'll break the sturdy and it's gonna

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.930 
we'll break the sturdy and it's gonna
take<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:09.920> down<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.040> like<00:04:10.190> three<00:04:10.250> quarters<00:04:10.790> or

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
take it down to like three quarters or

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.050 
take it down to like three quarters or
so<00:04:12.160> also<00:04:13.160> gonna<00:04:13.250> do<00:04:13.370> more<00:04:13.519> than<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.700> its

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
so also gonna do more than that its

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.949 
so also gonna do more than that its
gonna<00:04:14.239> do<00:04:14.299> it's<00:04:14.480> gonna<00:04:14.570> do<00:04:14.720> three<00:04:14.840> cause

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
gonna do it's gonna do three cause

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.599 
gonna do it's gonna do three cause
damage<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.769> now<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.010> can<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:16.160> go<00:04:16.310> for<00:04:16.430> drain

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
damage so now we can just go for drain

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.590 
damage so now we can just go for drain
punch<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:16.910> finish<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.120> off<00:04:17.209> even<00:04:17.479> though<00:04:17.570> I

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
punch and finish it off even though I

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.430 
punch and finish it off even though I
could<00:04:17.810> have<00:04:17.900> probably<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.260> gone<00:04:18.350> for

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
could have probably just gone for

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.590 
could have probably just gone for
crunchy<00:04:18.769> n<00:04:18.859> but<00:04:19.850> that's<00:04:20.030> whatever<00:04:20.390> we're

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
crunchy n but that's whatever we're

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.570 
crunchy n but that's whatever we're
gonna<00:04:20.690> knock<00:04:20.870> out<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.320> get<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.590> +1<00:04:22.010> Moxie

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
gonna knock out and get the +1 Moxie

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.320 
gonna knock out and get the +1 Moxie
boost<00:04:22.760> again<00:04:23.650> BAM<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.280> now<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.490> we<00:04:25.880> dragged<00:04:26.180> out

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
boost again BAM so now we we dragged out

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.890 
boost again BAM so now we we dragged out
