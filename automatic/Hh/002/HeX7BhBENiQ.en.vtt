00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
mcrib all right so I this might be messy

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.899 
mcrib all right so I this might be messy
but<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.739> do<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.040> let's<00:02:29.549> do<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.700> way

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
but we got to do it let's do the way

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.009 
but we got to do it let's do the way
test<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:30.959> how<00:02:31.079> much<00:02:31.260> these<00:02:31.409> bad<00:02:31.620> boys<00:02:31.859> way

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
this one is obviously three times more

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.149 
this one is obviously three times more
expensive<00:02:35.930> let's<00:02:36.930> wait<00:02:37.139> it<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.620> see<00:02:40.159> so
