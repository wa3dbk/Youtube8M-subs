00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of silver and that's why we have this

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
of silver and that's why we have this
funny<00:00:49.559> prices<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> difference<00:00:50.940> between

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
funny prices and the difference between

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
funny prices and the difference between
gold<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> silver<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> silver<00:00:52.230> being<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
gold and silver and the silver being so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.720 
gold and silver and the silver being so
low<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> price<00:00:54.329> reflects<00:00:55.730> having

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
low because if the price reflects having

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
low because if the price reflects having
more<00:00:56.910> iron<00:00:57.270> everything<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.820> really<00:01:00.590> one
