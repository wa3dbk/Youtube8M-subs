00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.730
 Well undoubtedly the challenge that if 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.629
 repair many defects that have the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 image but in my case as I like it 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.630
 use it for me for example is to empower 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.119
 what is light the density and the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.679
 contrast of the image 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 undoubtedly photoshop is used to 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.230
 repair many defects that have the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.870
 image but I personally lean more 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.720
 for a much more creative position and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.660
 much more visual of the image 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.610
 good the number of hours that I use as 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 mean to retouch a photograph of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.730
 Fashion is between 34 hours at the most 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.130
 usually the budget that there is for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.280
 this type of images is not very high 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.980
 especially in Spain and it is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 retouch between 10 and 15 photographs that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.150
 practically in a couple of days they have 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 to leave not therefore to touch up 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.339
 a fashion photo only take between 3 and 4 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.650
 hours at most a photo of beauties 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.590
 more complex especially for the subject of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.960
 the skin and makeup in that case the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.289
 number of hours since it can be between 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 67 hours per photo approximately 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.319
 biggest challenge because I think it's done 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.020
 daily and is to understand our customers 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.569
 and good I remember a campaign of a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.149
 champagne where the creatives 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.700
 they asked that through piloting the 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.380
 figure of the model had to introduce 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.479
 the girl inside a bottle and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.359
 it seems like forgiveness 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.030
 I was swimming, maybe it was not the 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.149
 greatest professional challenge but above all 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.829
 the biggest challenge is to understand what it is that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.539
 the client needs and what is the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.350
 feeling that they want to transmit to their 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.389
 images 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.359
 well in any case I consider myself a 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:55.880
 teacher I consider myself a technician of the 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.490
 Photography 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 and I've been retouching for many 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.509
 photographers since I was 18 years old now 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.340
 I'm 27 then exactly 9 years ago 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.560
 I started with the touch 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.090
 retouchers that I admire are two now 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.280
 same that I like a lot 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 one is pascal danwing that if I do not 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.050
 wrong he lives in new york and another is 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.870
 christopher wet that if I'm not wrong 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.959
 neither does he live in France and they are two 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.060
 professionals that seem to me we are going yes 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.299
 well it's good to study and it's my first 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 company has now released a second branch 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.280
 let's say it will be dedicated in 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.319
 exclusive to the elaboration or imparting 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
 courses related to the photo 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.000
 we thought that we were capable 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.819
 to organize a course raise a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.890
 agenda with some dates and bring the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.290
 course forward among other things to 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.870
 give me many fewer courses a year are going to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.670
 be much more exclusive and I'm going to 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.910
 try to have a much more follow up 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.950
 fine of all the students and together 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.470
 with me, professionals will come as 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.300
 javier vallhonrat that is already confirmed 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.400
 that the next minute without water 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.490
 a new project with my post course 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.740
 high-quality photographic production 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.020
 which will now take place on the 19th and 20th of 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.300
 may here in madrid 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.970
 What does this course give you? I think that 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.390
 especially at the technical level photoshop 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.860
 is very advanced let's say many people to 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.130
 technical level knows very well the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.160
 program where I see most lack is to 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.560
 visual level is to use photoshop for 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.570
 enhance the images and the course on 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.220
 everything is going to focus on doing that 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.770
 our images look better 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.930
 images but not for being very retouched 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.100
 but for having some coherence over 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.100
 all in color
