00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.760
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.770
 channel 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.050
 the topic of today's video is in my 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.460
 Kindley if anyone knows kendall this 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.529
 one of the most popular in the world 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.169
 e-books released by the company 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.900
 amazon someone this topic may seem 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.490
 not quite summer but I think summer 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.410
 this is exactly the time when we have 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.220
 there is more time for yourself and for 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.500
 my hobbies 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.720
 but generally it's very nice to sit with 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.280
 a book somewhere in nature or take 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.680
 yourself on the beach before was enough 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.540
 difficult to take somewhere on 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.489
 rest your favorite books for what they are 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.589
 just heavy take up a lot of space in 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.260
 Suitcases but now electronic 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.570
 books they generally do not take up space and 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.610
 you weigh a few hundred grams like this 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.199
 will bring makin gave this model to the pope 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.940
 flight she came out in 2013 and her 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.890
 undoubted plus the fact that its screen 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.350
 completely imitates paper as per 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.810
 on touch and on my mind 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.760
 model without 3g function but with wai function 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.750
 File also in the Kindle there is a built-in 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.310
 the browser is true but quite so 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.079
 demo browser and it's called even 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.359
 experimental I ordered it 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.340
 directly with amazon and and there it was worth 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.859
 stay dollars except shipping to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.079
 Russia and still want to show this 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.140
 girl's thing as a case for kindle 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.999
 I have not bought them specifically for the movie here 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.310
 This case gave me my girlfriend for 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:36.969
 thank them and another case 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.740
 I myself bought it smaller in size well 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.689
 and generally i use both of them 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.789
 Well, let's go directly to the books 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.429
 who in my Kindley immediately want 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.979
 make a reservation that some books I honestly 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.560
 buy some books i'm downloading i 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.810
 no urge to do the same you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.789
 you yourself know what choice you make and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.670
 I also want to notice that I have a little 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.219
 resent eBook prices don't 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.749
 only for thrown but in general, in principle, I 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.969
 I think that it is not much strange that 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.340
 e-books now cost about 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.130
 as much and sometimes more expensive than 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.980
 paper books but in fact it is a file 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.410
 have you not get exactly physical 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.300
 object physical book and i believe that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
 in the future publishing house shopping 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.660
 It will be necessary to reduce prices on 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000
 eBooks 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.830
 besides the browser cut down kindly there 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.600
 one more yes 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.300
 on tk it is a brand body which 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.980
 fingerprints remain before I 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.600
 never fond of detectives 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.610
 but when I started reading agate kristi 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.530
 literally dropped out of real life on 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.270
 few weeks most to me 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.460
 liked the novel ten little indians 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.250
 as well as books about the adventures of the detective 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.410
 poirot on the wave of his new passion 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.390
 I read all the classic detectives 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.950
 the story of sherlock holmes before i 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.570
 somehow avoided them 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.990
 but now I understand why 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.580
 the famous detective goes crazy the whole world 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.470
 before I threw, I read 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.510
 Sakkra on a regular mobile phone 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.460
 Well, of course it is absolutely not comparable 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.200
 because the best thing in king is 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.660
 that its screen does not glare at all 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.860
 the sun 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.050
 when they ask me what is my favorite 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.950
 or I always call the three in the boat not 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.720
 counting dogs 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.580
 This is one of those books that can 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.950
 open and read from any page and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.630
 besides the number of previous readings 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 never diminish pleasure 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.470
 Jane Austin books are also possible 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.300
 reread again and again and what and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.360
 the older I get, the more new I am 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.460
 I discover in them for myself and for this book 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.140
 stumbled by chance i think 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.090
 that everyone who likes romance and sisters 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.100
 Bronte Jane Austin will be very interesting 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.250
 find out how women actually lived 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.910
 victorian england and again talking about 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.740
 england only 20th century already humorous 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.080
 the work of woodhouse was staged 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.360
 famous television series windy 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.670
 aristocrats in it played Hillary 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.980
 and his butler jeeves and the wall strike 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.980
 the show is pretty old enough 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.600
 good so I advise everyone to see 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.540
 And now for a completely different genre and 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.530
 puddle trailer their steven king recognized 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.140
 the king of this genre 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.500
 his books are a must-read for 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.090
 everyone who loves a scary story yet 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.010
 I want to talk a little about books 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.200
 famous physics of stephen hawking 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.030
 it often turns out that we have a very 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.940
 little and an idea of ​​the world in which we 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.590
 we live in the popular science form steven 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.080
 Hawking is trying to explain what is 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.770
 time what is the universe and what awaits us 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.260
 in the future I hope this video was for you 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.690
