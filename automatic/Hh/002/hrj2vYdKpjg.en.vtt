00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 darkness thickened over the underpass 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.089
 on the square Lyadova and how in 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.519
 literally and financially 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.410
 transition disappeared light and the original 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.719
 version was another act of urban 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 vandalism but it turned out that the situation 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 much more serious transition in the center 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.600
 the city became like a maze needed 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.880
 twist in the dark people often 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.880
 pass and just hit the walls 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:43.120
 light why is there no scary just 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.950
 went i went here fought in the wall of what 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.470
 I candle I light myself on 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.990
 if i don't have other workarounds then 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.990
 I have to go here people with 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.950
 flashlight should not walk on the topic 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.870
 wrong in the morning more or less 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.600
 tolerable here is the light making its way to the map 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.440
 at least in a year and forever so we go 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.309
 new crisis hit the economy as a whole 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.860
 almost change 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.520
 save energy they intercept you 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.950
 exactly 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600
 darkness is a friend of youth i don't know why i 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 here went actually very here 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 dark but romantic not all with flashlights i 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.070
 I think see how many romantics and the state 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.900
 romantic dark no one can see which 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.300
 Romance can be romantic 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.470
 the situation but we are afraid of the inhabitants 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.479
 the girl says it is here somewhere 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 scared to scare me i mean i thought 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.110
 the diagnosis will be discussed at the top here and 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.240
 here I go to the transition and absolutely 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.440
 dark there here she is honest see me i 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.270
 just standing there and scaring his arrest I 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.430
 I think with how the new quest to leave the room 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.119
 registers dine satisfied streaming and 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.380
 by the way for free but as much as 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.259
 reported in the power sales company 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.240
 I quote power supply limitation 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.190
 The transition to the square Lyadova occurred by 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.470
 the reason for the outstanding debt in the amount of 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.630
 three hundred forty-six thousand rubles in 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.369
 administration of the Nizhny Novgorod region on 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.899
 today the debt is not 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.030
 paid for end of quotation 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.170
 why did the energy industry go on so 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.420
 tough measures and why the administration 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 the district did not pay during the invoice 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.840
 unknown to both sides of the interview 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.730
 flatly refuse 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 in general, some amazing attempt 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.240
 hide that and so everyone can see more precisely 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.240
 not visible in the city center
