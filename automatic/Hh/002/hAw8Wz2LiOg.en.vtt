00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
concerned it's something that I don't
really<00:01:48.630> notice<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.470> much<00:01:49.649> unless<00:01:49.890> I'm

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
really notice all that much unless I'm

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.950 
really notice all that much unless I'm
really<00:01:50.460> thinking<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> me<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
really thinking about it so to me it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
really thinking about it so to me it's
not<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> standout<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.829> far<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> shoe<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
not a standout as far as the shoe is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
not a standout as far as the shoe is
concerned<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.329> stud<00:01:54.600> pattern<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.110> also

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
concerned but the stud pattern is also

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
concerned but the stud pattern is also
really<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> mention<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> shoe

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really good not to mention that the shoe

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.959 
really good not to mention that the shoe
is<00:01:57.630> surprisingly<00:01:58.229> lightweight<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> solid

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
is surprisingly lightweight for as solid

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.810 
is surprisingly lightweight for as solid
as<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.180> feels<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:01.590> next<00:02:01.860> pick<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> nike

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
as it feels my next pick is the nike

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.670 
they're trying to preserve them a little
bit<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.329> again<00:03:21.840> playing<00:03:22.079> out<00:03:22.200> artificial

that always like to ask about durability

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.259 
that always like to ask about durability
I've<00:03:37.829> been<00:03:38.100> using<00:03:38.310> these<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.579> lot<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.180> last

at<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.989> point<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.410> time<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.890> can't<00:03:50.459> say<00:03:50.760> that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
at this point in time I can't say that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.729 
at this point in time I can't say that
wearing<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.420> firm<00:03:51.690> ground<00:03:51.930> pair<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.380> artificial

wearing a firm ground pair on artificial

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.160 
wearing a firm ground pair on artificial
grass<00:03:53.130> would<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:53.940> been<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.390> same<00:03:54.420> exact

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
grass would have been the same exact

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.630 
grass would have been the same exact
result<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.859> again<00:03:56.040> if<00:03:56.340> you're<00:03:56.459> playing

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
result so again if you're playing

last week or so this one may surprise
you<00:04:12.359> just<00:04:12.600> because<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.109> isn't<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.560> best<00:04:13.739> in

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
when it comes to traction and just

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.909 
when it comes to traction and just
overall<00:04:17.870> responsiveness<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.500> what<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.650> can

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
overall responsiveness but what I can

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.190 
overall responsiveness but what I can
say<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.370> shoe<00:04:20.579> delivers<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.450> no

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
it's that weightless sensation when you

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.800 
it's that weightless sensation when you
wear<00:04:27.520> them<00:04:27.730> not<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.300> mention<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.600> they're

again<00:04:34.720> there's<00:04:35.020> something<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.470> be<00:04:35.590> said<00:04:35.620> about

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
again there's something to be said about

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.680 
again there's something to be said about
wearing<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.490> pair<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.790> shoes<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.330> you

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
wearing a pair of shoes that you

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.780 
wearing a pair of shoes that you
honestly<00:04:38.080> can't<00:04:38.680> tell<00:04:38.770> are<00:04:39.160> on<00:04:39.340> your<00:04:39.580> feet

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
honestly can't tell are on your feet

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.760 
honestly can't tell are on your feet
just<00:04:40.090> because<00:04:40.420> of<00:04:40.540> how<00:04:40.660> light<00:04:40.930> they<00:04:41.140> are<00:04:41.170> they

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
just because of how light they are they

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.200 
just because of how light they are they
certainly<00:04:42.160> are<00:04:42.370> better<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.760> terms<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.090> overall

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
certainly are better in terms of overall

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.240 
certainly are better in terms of overall
performance<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:44.200> comparison<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.160> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.330 
to wear the standard as you or the crazy
light<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.720> probably<00:04:50.260> pick<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.680> standard<00:04:51.100> one

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
light I probably pick the standard one

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.820 
light I probably pick the standard one
but<00:04:51.910> again<00:04:52.180> while<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.840> performance<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.530> not

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
but again while the performance is not

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.160 
but again while the performance is not
up<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.220> par<00:04:54.250> with<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.730> standard<00:04:55.210> ad0<00:04:55.540> that's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
up to par with the standard ad0 that's

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.330 
up to par with the standard ad0 that's
not<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.500> say<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.890> shoe<00:04:57.130> isn't

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340

not to say that this shoe isn't
unwearable<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.450> again<00:04:58.900> it's<00:04:59.080> more<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.380> a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
unwearable and again it's more of a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.800 
unwearable and again it's more of a
novelty<00:04:59.680> type<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.340> item<00:05:00.670> in<00:05:00.820> my<00:05:01.060> opinion<00:05:01.390> if
