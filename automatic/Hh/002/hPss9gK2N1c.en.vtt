00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
and that causes the engine to move in

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.850

more<00:03:34.780> efficient<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:36.040> found<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> combustor

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
more efficient we found that a combustor

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500 
more efficient we found that a combustor

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
lot of fuel very quickly well that in

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.839 
lot of fuel very quickly well that in
turn<00:03:44.200> creates<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.709> lot<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:44.980> high<00:03:45.250> temperatures

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
turn creates a lot of high temperatures

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.849 
turn creates a lot of high temperatures
in<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.150> combustor<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.290> materials<00:03:47.769> that

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
in the combustor and the materials that

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.679 
in the combustor and the materials that
are<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.280> engines<00:03:48.640> right<00:03:48.819> now<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.359> can't

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
are in the engines right now just can't

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.149 
are in the engines right now just can't
withstand<00:03:49.900> those<00:03:50.439> temperatures<00:03:50.950> without

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
withstand those temperatures without

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.119 
withstand those temperatures without

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
failing so what we're doing is we're

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.429 
failing so what we're doing is we're
looking<00:03:54.730> at<00:03:54.879> new<00:03:55.150> materials<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.959> can<00:03:56.409> be

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
looking at new materials that can be

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.289 
looking at new materials that can be
created<00:03:57.069> that<00:03:57.280> withstand<00:03:57.909> those<00:03:58.060> higher

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
created that withstand those higher
