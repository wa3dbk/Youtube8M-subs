00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
who I respected most of his points but

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
who I respected most of his points but
questioned<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:46.799> point<00:01:47.009> about<00:01:47.310> inform

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
questioned at one point about inform

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.069 
questioned at one point about inform
artisan<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.390> being<00:01:48.600> particularly

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
artisan was not being particularly

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.260 
artisan was not being particularly
useful<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> points<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.090> are

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
useful to me but the points which are

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.560 
useful to me but the points which are
stood<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:53.310> passive<00:01:53.880> learning<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
stood out was about passive learning and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
stood out was about passive learning and
I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:55.890> depends<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I think it really depends on how you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.319 
I think it really depends on how you
watch<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.869> video<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.159> try<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.880> interact

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
watch a video if you try and interact

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
watch a video if you try and interact
with<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.840> online<00:02:01.140> resources<00:02:01.560> etc

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
with other online resources etc

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.880 
with other online resources etc
databases<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.960> interact<00:02:04.500> more<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
databases to interact more with the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.119 
databases to interact more with the
video<00:02:05.159> content<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.689> maybe<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.380> becomes<00:02:07.530> less

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
video content then maybe it becomes less

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.900 
video content then maybe it becomes less
passive<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.170> any<00:02:10.500> major<00:02:11.489> insight

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
passive so I think if any major insight

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.150 
passive so I think if any major insight
was<00:02:12.060> gained<00:02:12.270> from<00:02:12.510> this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
was gained from this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.590 
was gained from this
discussion<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.850> think<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.450> about

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
discussion I think this is it about

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.980 
discussion I think this is it about
passivity<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:16.790> any<00:02:17.060> computer<00:02:17.810> based

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
passivity so with any computer based

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.290 
passivity so with any computer based
resources<00:02:18.730> sometimes<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
resources sometimes you have the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.590 
resources sometimes you have the
potential<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:21.020> more<00:02:21.650> easily<00:02:21.800> perhaps

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
potential to more easily perhaps

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
potential to more easily perhaps
investigate<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.750> put<00:02:23.930> for<00:02:24.140> an<00:02:24.200> engine<00:02:24.500> or

variations which have been presented to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.950 
variations which have been presented to
you<00:02:31.070> but<00:02:31.910> if<00:02:32.060> you're<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.330> reading<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.750> book

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
you but if you're just reading a book

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.570 
you but if you're just reading a book
saying<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.680> probably<00:02:33.980> more<00:02:34.130> difficult

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
saying that it's probably more difficult

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.600 
saying that it's probably more difficult
to<00:02:34.610> interact<00:02:35.150> with<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> content<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.370> maybe

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
to interact with the content so maybe

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.640 
to interact with the content so maybe
it's<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.330> actually<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.900> secret<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.380> how<00:02:39.590> you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's it's actually the secret is how you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's it's actually the secret is how you
use<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.540> video<00:02:41.750> resources<00:02:42.290> if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.650> want<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
use the video resources if you want to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.910 
use the video resources if you want to
learn<00:02:43.160> openings<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:45.230> know<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.590> point

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
learn openings and you know that point

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.830 
learn openings and you know that point
was<00:02:46.130> made<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:47.000> trying<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> raise

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
was made here about trying to raise

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.610 
was made here about trying to raise
other<00:02:48.830> level<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.250> interactivity<00:02:50.470> when<00:02:51.470> you're

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
other level of interactivity when you're

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.640 
other level of interactivity when you're
looking<00:02:52.210> video<00:02:53.210> by<00:02:54.140> some<00:02:54.680> people<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:55.910> response

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
looking video by some people in response

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060 
looking video by some people in response
for<00:02:57.650> example<00:02:58.070> our<00:02:58.400> writin<00:02:58.970> wrote<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.800> he

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
for example our writin wrote that he

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.310 
for example our writin wrote that he
would<00:03:01.280> pause<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.790> video<00:03:01.910> go<00:03:02.810> over<00:03:02.990> stuff<00:03:03.050> he

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
would pause the video go over stuff he

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.200 
would pause the video go over stuff he
didn't<00:03:03.530> understand<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:05.090> know

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
didn't understand and so you know

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.300 
didn't understand and so you know
there's<00:03:05.690> an<00:03:05.810> argument<00:03:06.020> made<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.740> can<00:03:07.040> be

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
there's an argument made that you can be

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.440 
there's an argument made that you can be
less<00:03:07.610> passive<00:03:08.080> with<00:03:09.080> with<00:03:09.500> video<00:03:09.800> content<00:03:10.520> and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
less passive with with video content and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.230 
less passive with with video content and
actually<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.560> was<00:03:12.710> having<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.240> related

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
actually you know I was having a related

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.320 
actually you know I was having a related

about um you know in the future will

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.760 
about um you know in the future will
university<00:03:20.630> lectures<00:03:20.990> will<00:03:21.170> everyone<00:03:21.440> still

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
university lectures will everyone still

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.770 
university lectures will everyone still
be<00:03:21.860> going<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.160> lectures<00:03:22.550> will<00:03:22.730> be<00:03:22.880> looking<00:03:23.540> at

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
be going to lectures will be looking at

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.900 
be going to lectures will be looking at
videos<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.410> course<00:03:24.890> lectures<00:03:25.430> bring<00:03:25.700> together

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
videos of course lectures bring together

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.530 
videos of course lectures bring together
people<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:28.610> they're<00:03:28.790> more<00:03:28.940> motivated<00:03:29.510> to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
people and they're more motivated to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.780 
people and they're more motivated to
listen<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.050> lecture<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.709> ask<00:03:30.980> questions<00:03:31.220> and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
listen to lecture and ask questions and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.640 
listen to lecture and ask questions and
interact<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.720> other<00:03:32.900> students<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.530> it's

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
interact with other students and it's

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.740 
interact with other students and it's
all<00:03:33.740> social<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.520> it's<00:03:35.000> disciplined<00:03:35.510> and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
all social and it's disciplined and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.090 
all social and it's disciplined and
everyone<00:03:36.140> could<00:03:36.230> be<00:03:36.350> at<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.470> same<00:03:36.650> point<00:03:36.950> in

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
everyone could be at the same point in

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100 
everyone could be at the same point in
every<00:03:37.310> space<00:03:37.700> part<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.390> time<00:03:38.600> during<00:03:38.900> that

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
every space part in time during that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.140 
every space part in time during that
course<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.250> don't<00:03:40.490> think<00:03:40.700> lectures<00:03:41.030> are

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
course so I don't think lectures are

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.180 
course so I don't think lectures are
going<00:03:41.360> anywhere<00:03:41.660> anytime<00:03:41.870> soon<00:03:42.110> well<00:03:43.100> they

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
going anywhere anytime soon well they

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.860 
going anywhere anytime soon well they
like<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.610> should<00:03:43.850> heed<00:03:44.030> your<00:03:44.209> recording

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
like you should heed your recording

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.229 
like you should heed your recording
lectures<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.410> videos<00:03:45.739> but<00:03:46.520> really<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:46.940> need

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
lectures and videos but really you need

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.240 
lectures and videos but really you need
to<00:03:47.420> be<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:48.050> know<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.530> environment<00:03:48.890> that

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
to be you know in that environment that

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
to be you know in that environment that
discipline<00:03:49.820> environment<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:50.810> maybe<00:03:51.350> the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
discipline environment to have maybe the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.370 
discipline environment to have maybe the
motivation<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.580> stimulation<00:03:53.380> to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
motivation that the stimulation to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.470 
motivation that the stimulation to
follow<00:03:54.620> through<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.040> know<00:03:55.370> where<00:03:56.209> you're<00:03:56.390> at

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
follow through you know where you're at

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.120 
follow through you know where you're at
on<00:03:56.540> all<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.900> different<00:03:57.020> courses<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.680> so

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
on all the different courses you want so

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.590 
on all the different courses you want so
I<00:03:58.160> don't<00:03:58.400> know<00:03:58.459> videos<00:03:58.910> are<00:03:59.150> not<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.390> be-all

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
I don't know videos are not the be-all

them<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> passive<00:04:03.680> or<00:04:03.800> non<00:04:03.980> passive

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
them in like a passive or non passive

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.490 
them in like a passive or non passive
way<00:04:04.489> which<00:04:04.730> adds<00:04:05.000> greatly<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:06.290> their

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
