00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay this video is gonna be to show how

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay this video is gonna be to show how
I<00:00:02.190> made<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:03.020> evaporation<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.410> emissions

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
I made my evaporation and emissions

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.140 
I made my evaporation and emissions
smoke<00:00:06.240> test<00:00:06.540> machine<00:00:07.370> so<00:00:08.370> here<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.700> is

basically air goes in here runs all the
way<00:00:27.810> through<00:00:27.900> these<00:00:28.289> lines<00:00:28.560> till<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> comes<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
way through these lines till it comes to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
way through these lines till it comes to
this<00:00:29.820> y<00:00:30.539> fitting<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.460> unit<00:00:32.820> air<00:00:33.480> induces

this y fitting at the unit air induces

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.209 
this y fitting at the unit air induces
above<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.760> fluid<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.270> using<00:00:36.450> baby<00:00:36.750> oil<00:00:37.219> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
above the fluid I'm using baby oil to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.410 
above the fluid I'm using baby oil to
give<00:00:38.850> positive<00:00:39.059> pressure<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.890> cylinder

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
give positive pressure in the cylinder

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.060 
give positive pressure in the cylinder
coming<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.809> air<00:00:43.050> also<00:00:43.379> goes<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.770> here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
coming back here air also goes up here

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880 
coming back here air also goes up here
to<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> fitting<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> goes<00:00:45.750> down<00:00:46.079> into

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to this fitting and it goes down into

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760 
to this fitting and it goes down into
the<00:00:47.250> fluid<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> pressure<00:00:49.289> under<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the fluid to put the pressure under the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
the fluid to put the pressure under the
fluid<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> make<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> bubble<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> splash<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> a

fluid and make it bubble and splash on a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
fluid and make it bubble and splash on a
glow<00:00:52.469> plug<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.879> mounted<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:55.160> under

glow plug which is mounted right under

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
glow plug which is mounted right under
the<00:00:56.250> unit<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> 60<00:00:57.149> G<00:00:57.360> self-regulating

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the unit it's a 60 G self-regulating

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.510 
the unit it's a 60 G self-regulating
glow<00:00:58.469> plug<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:59.309> ACDelco<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.920> once<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
glow plug from ACDelco so once you do

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
glow plug from ACDelco so once you do
all<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.390> positive<00:01:03.960> pressure<00:01:04.350> gets

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
all that the positive pressure gets

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.160 
all that the positive pressure gets
created<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.880> pressure<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
created in a can this pressure from the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
created in a can this pressure from the
top<00:01:07.350> bubble<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> fluid<00:01:08.310> under<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
top bubble is the fluid under and it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.760 
top bubble is the fluid under and it
splashes<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> glow<00:01:10.260> plug<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
splashes on the glow plug which is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
splashes on the glow plug which is
glowing<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.310> inside<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
glowing right inside and what that will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.030 
glowing right inside and what that will
do<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.439> I'll<00:01:13.640> burn<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.939> baby<00:01:15.530> oil<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
do is that I'll burn the baby oil and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
do is that I'll burn the baby oil and
create<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> smoke<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.509> get

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
create the smoke which will then get

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
create the smoke which will then get
pushed<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.990> into<00:01:22.100> whatever<00:01:23.100> vacuum

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
pushed out here and into whatever vacuum

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
pushed out here and into whatever vacuum
system<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> check<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.229> gonna

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
system you want to check so I'm gonna

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.270 
system you want to check so I'm gonna
give<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> test<00:01:26.009> shot<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:28.070> can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.189> how

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
give it a test shot here you can see how

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.169 
give it a test shot here you can see how
good<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> works

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.969 

look<00:01:37.179> at<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.659> can<00:01:38.020> control<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> flow<00:01:38.619> with

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
look at that I can control the flow with

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.950 
look at that I can control the flow with
bursts<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:40.000> make<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:42.880> pressure<00:01:43.210> little

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
bursts to make no pressure little

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.880 
bursts to make no pressure little
pressure<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.329> just<00:01:46.479> keeps<00:01:46.659> on<00:01:46.869> coming<00:01:46.929> so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
pressure but it just keeps on coming so

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
pressure but it just keeps on coming so
there<00:01:48.429> you<00:01:48.579> go<00:01:48.929> your<00:01:49.929> $1200<00:01:50.619> machine<00:01:51.069> for<00:01:51.459> a
