00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.760
 the primed booting is something 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.960
 of primordial for the success of the 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.980
 fishing it's true that it's not always 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 easy to master 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
 and that's what will make it possible to succeed 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.320
 your fishing party 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.879
 so in relation to that we're still going 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 look today for fishing in 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.390
 state of everything that is all that can 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 to be made to catch fish 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 different 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.700
 Let's keep breams carp catfish 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 fish found in all 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.300
 states of a whole new and following the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.560
 death what we will use so we will 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 to be able to take one sooner than 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.789
 the other and vice versa so that's a 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.199
 point of the fishing party very very 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.149
 important that it absolutely does not 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.100
 neglect and we will try to see with 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 our specialists and our fishermen 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 what are the best primer for 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.269
 each type of fish is then jérôme 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 today you are going to fish the cards 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.069
 yes you are you will wet the crate that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.479
 use but we sinned and away 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.359
 first time so i 'm going to use 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.010
 four paws and love and beforehand 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.600
 I'm going to inflate cake with 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 the sco text later explains 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.579
 not what I'm going to wet with the ride 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.979
 it's often for these quarters but 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.540
 something like I would like this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.159
 context quite strong used by the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.659
 artists for boilie fishing 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.850
 art or mixed job yes it's going 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 allow the east to inflate it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.590
 at the same time that it mixes with heart 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.329
 in the middle of especially so it will take a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.890
 about ten minutes for the 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.530
 oil cake but how much water pretty much 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 for a kg of oil cake near 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.200
 to be cleared and it drinks a lot 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 I'm going to mix it up and it's going to swell that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 we will be able to start preparing the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.859
 mixes we see the forums released the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.479
 relax the mix discount it will be 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.210
 much simpler in itself 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.329
 add again that's the equivalent of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.329
 two cans widely widely a liter 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.630
 it's a shame we can not feel 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.729
 the floor here the quarters people like 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.049
 me it will go well here I would 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.049
 to come that it takes him
