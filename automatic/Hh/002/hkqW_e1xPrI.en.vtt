damage<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:43.980> this<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.940> good<00:01:45.060> weapon

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
damage so this is a really good weapon

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.930 
damage so this is a really good weapon
for<00:01:45.450> PvE<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.620> you're<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.830> get<00:01:47.040> bosses<00:01:47.730> and

the other stats they're so thorns giving
it<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.350> little<00:03:40.560> bit<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.980> hand<00:03:41.220> cannon<00:03:41.489> nerves

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
it a little bit of a hand cannon nerves

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.569 
it a little bit of a hand cannon nerves
and<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.660> little<00:03:42.930> bit<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.410> special<00:03:44.070> nerve<00:03:44.250> just

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
and a little bit of a special nerve just

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.840 
and a little bit of a special nerve just
due<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.180> its<00:03:45.510> damage<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.950> does<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
due to its damage that it does so I

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.199 
due to its damage that it does so I
think<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> good<00:03:49.049> move<00:03:49.260> with<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> thorn

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209

inventory<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.680> 18<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.280> think<00:04:42.310> prior<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.240> it

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
inventory to 18 I think prior that it

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.890 
inventory to 18 I think prior that it
was<00:04:43.510> 15<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.700> white<00:04:45.970> head<00:04:46.210> perk<00:04:46.540> where<00:04:46.810> it

was 15 but the white head perk where it

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.690 
was 15 but the white head perk where it

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
takes the ammo when you get three

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.310 
takes the ammo when you get three
directions<00:04:49.030> it's<00:04:49.600> going<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.780> take<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.110> from

directions it's going to take it from

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.350 
directions it's going to take it from
your<00:04:50.440> inventory<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.580> get<00:04:51.880> instead<00:04:52.270> of

just giving it to you for free so I can
understand<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.260> mean<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:56.860> probably

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
understand that I mean this is probably

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.950 
understand that I mean this is probably
the<00:04:57.280> only<00:04:57.370> thing<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.790> could<00:04:57.940> lay<00:04:58.600> open

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the only thing that could lay open

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.670 
the only thing that could lay open
something<00:04:59.169> faster<00:04:59.860> than<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:01.000> ice<00:05:01.180> breaker<00:05:01.680> so

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
something faster than the ice breaker so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.620 
something faster than the ice breaker so
I<00:05:02.979> can<00:05:03.130> understand<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.610> like<00:05:03.760> I've<00:05:04.060> said<00:05:04.270> but

you know like I said I think in and it's
needed<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.169> little<00:05:23.440> bit<00:05:23.590> of<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.830> nerve

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
needed a little bit of a nerve

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.510 
needed a little bit of a nerve
especially<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.780> steel<00:05:26.289> nut<00:05:26.560> oh<00:05:26.710> hey<00:05:26.919> Candace<00:05:27.220> I

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
going to go faster so they're going to

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.180 
going to go faster so they're going to
be<00:05:57.340> better<00:05:58.000> up<00:05:58.630> close<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:59.380> at<00:05:59.530> medium<00:05:59.979> range

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
and then not so great at

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.030 
and then not so great at
you<00:06:02.270> know<00:06:02.419> for<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.780> range<00:06:03.110> which<00:06:03.410> is<00:06:03.740> smart

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
you know for a range which is smart

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.150 
you know for a range which is smart
that's<00:06:04.370> how<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.699> should<00:06:04.729> be<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.840> then

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
that's how it should be and then

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.290 
that's how it should be and then
