00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
any damage to it if I put the clamp

farther<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.570> phone<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.590> surface<00:02:52.770> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
farther into the phone on the surface it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.490 
farther into the phone on the surface it
registers<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:53.970> being<00:02:54.120> touched<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
registers as it's being touched so it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.990 
registers as it's being touched so it
kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.680> messes<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:56.040> any<00:02:56.160> videos<00:02:56.490> or<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.880> would

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000

hit those function keys I like it

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.980
