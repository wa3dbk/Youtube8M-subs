00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it's your radiator hose clamp just like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.240 
it's your radiator hose clamp just like
these<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.040> car<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.800> salvage<00:02:34.099> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.860 

pull<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:38.910> off<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.300> slide<00:02:39.480> them<00:02:39.570> off<00:02:39.720> of

pull them off got to slide them off of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.590 
pull them off got to slide them off of
here<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.950> they're<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.400> tight<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
here because they're really tight and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:53.420 
here because they're really tight and
they<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.870> gummy<00:02:43.110> from<00:02:43.320> the

well those two ends have to be tightened
what<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.599> have<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:02.220> off

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.059 

over<00:03:09.380> maybe<00:03:09.590> about<00:03:09.920> Jewish<00:03:10.580> chances<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.150> way

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.390 

actually<00:03:15.819> I<00:03:15.969> could<00:03:16.150> live<00:03:16.329> this<00:03:16.420> on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400

my<00:03:20.400> Centrepointe

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
my Centrepointe

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.979 
my Centrepointe
then<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.319> can<00:03:23.470> pull<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.920> pull<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.569> little

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
up a couple inches this way that way so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:53.890 
up a couple inches this way that way so
that's<00:03:37.140> about<00:03:37.350> four<00:03:37.590> inches

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900 

this<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.019> Manila<00:03:55.349> rope<00:03:55.410> by<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.769> way<00:03:55.980> very

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
this is Manila rope by the way very

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:12.680 
this is Manila rope by the way very
strong<00:03:57.239> rope

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.310 

okay<00:04:14.010> now<00:04:15.010> we'll<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.690> put<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.780> back<00:04:16.930> up<00:04:17.140> where

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
okay now we'll see put it back up where

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:36.309 
okay now we'll see put it back up where
it<00:04:17.350> measures<00:04:17.650> up

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:46.670

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.499 

there<00:04:47.310> we<00:04:47.460> got<00:04:47.580> it

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.420 

we<00:04:53.110> took<00:04:53.229> up<00:04:53.349> all<00:04:53.529> this<00:04:53.650> slack<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.099> here<00:04:54.279> we

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
we took up all this slack in here we

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.269 
we took up all this slack in here we
timed<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.759> really<00:04:54.999> well<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:56.110> then<00:04:56.409> you<00:04:57.159> see

timed it really well and then you see
how<00:04:57.340> much<00:04:57.460> space<00:04:57.669> we<00:04:57.879> have<00:04:58.029> now<00:04:58.180> once<00:04:58.930> we

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
how much space we have now once we

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.480 
how much space we have now once we
tighten<00:04:59.349> that<00:04:59.439> up<00:04:59.499> maybe<00:04:59.860> just<00:05:00.129> a<00:05:00.219> few<00:05:00.249> more

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
tighten that up maybe just a few more

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.329 
tighten that up maybe just a few more
inches<00:05:00.639> this<00:05:00.849> would<00:05:00.999> be<00:05:01.089> snug<00:05:01.659> as<00:05:01.779> a<00:05:01.809> bug<00:05:01.870> again

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:02.339 
inches this would be snug as a bug again
