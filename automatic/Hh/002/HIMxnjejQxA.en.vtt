00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.720
 from the point of view of saying what is 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.910
 what to do to the most basically 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 institute remember the law the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 Airplane lift is a mixture of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.269
 that of positive expressions in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.480
 negative pressures up and down 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.960
 mandela 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.960
 in blood 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.490
 to the extent that the union esma 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.270
 it has a curvature towards the tips what 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.489
 what it does is divert the turbulence from 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.620
 puntacana the turbulence of the tips 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.930
 of the wings and takes it more towards the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.140
 wing and expel her in a more 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.270
 efficient when extending the eagle the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 wind and pressure one more way 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.010
 efficient what it does is produce a 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.350
 fuel savings that around 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.489
 in economic terms approximately 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.489
 the company when it works 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
 and without you about the other forty 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.000
 and so many planes that came to have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 you will fly 43 if you do not get 40 49 how 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 do this incorporation of the new 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.490
 aircraft the system that there are two 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.080
 phenomena that are happening 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 the first is that little by little they are 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 leaving the 319 if they are planes with 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.880
 which originally started the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880
 airline 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.460
 due to size and critical mass 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.979
 that we have achieved 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.979
 they can go out and enter 320 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 passengers 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.260
 and we will incorporate it as we have 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.230
 come doing the last two years 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 for the ratio of plus or minus between 5 and 7 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.260
 years 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.460
 at this moment as you see him fly from 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 mexico aviation as you and I see it 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.130
 I think they are different things with mexico 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.530
 is experiencing an extraordinary moment 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 in terms of trade are traffic 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.189
 aerial 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.780
 in the market an album was a market 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.630
 more or less bonomi 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.410
 56 million passengers last year 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.590
 28 million passengers in the year and with 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.260
 the history of aviation in mexico 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.870
 we had more traffic than three ago 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.630
 this way the output of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.000
 mexicana and the exit via calle de las las 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.280
 airline works that came out we got to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 a point where the domestic market has 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.230
 come to an important result in the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 international part happens the same is 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.250
 a market more or less the same size 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.459
 has reached more or less to 28 million 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.620
 of passengers per year 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.510
 and the rates of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.269
 growth of the national market and or 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.400
 I see about twice as much the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.470
 video 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.030
 that is to say more or less sentences of 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.790
 many hits for years 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.610
 I would say 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.189
 that the growth rates of mexico 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.400
 they are much better than the rest of the 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.400
 world 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.590
 economic 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.470
 the US is making them markets 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 far from growing in terms of number of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.860
 passengers are consolidating and are 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.890
 growing a little bit very slowly and a 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.780
 euro more and there is growth 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.080
 finances a very equation is maintained 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.150
 similar to Mexico's and that's 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.350
 basically what is happening and 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.320
 South America with stable growth 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.070
 of more or less between 13 and 15 depending 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.070
 to the countries
