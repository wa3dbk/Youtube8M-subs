you do them as fast as you possibly can

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
you do them as fast as you possibly can
because<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> transfer<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
because you want to transfer that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
because you want to transfer that
strength<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.500> vertical<00:01:46.890> leap<00:01:47.420> at<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
strength into your vertical leap at the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
strength into your vertical leap at the
same<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:48.960> make<00:01:49.200> sure<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.799> heavy<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you can on the weight and do it in load

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.469 
you can on the weight and do it in load
repetitions<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.280> means<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.700> routine

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
repetitions that means your routine

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.550 
repetitions that means your routine

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
should be four sets of six reps or so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
should be four sets of six reps or so
when<00:01:58.560> doing<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> whole<00:01:59.490> movement<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.939> squad

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
when doing the whole movement of squad

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.819 
when doing the whole movement of squad
make<00:02:00.689> sure<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.409> low<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
make sure that you go as low as you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.550 
make sure that you go as low as you
possibly<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.180> remember<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.350> lower

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
possibly can because remember the lower

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230 
possibly can because remember the lower
you<00:02:04.799> go<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.310> muscles<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.030> work

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you go the more muscles you will work

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
you go the more muscles you will work
and<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.840> need<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.409> muscles<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.069> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
legs when you use it for vertical jump

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.630 
legs when you use it for vertical jump
so<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> where<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> squat<00:02:11.790> will

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
so this is where the squat will

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.080 
so this is where the squat will
