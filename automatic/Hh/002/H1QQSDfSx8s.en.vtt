00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 no desire to have it then get it now 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.519
 gold items accounts or leveling 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.519
 left mmo 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.960
 hello dear wow friends here is the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.050
 body already I welcome you completely 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.789
 welcome to another video which 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
 about the upcoming world of warcraft 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.350
 extension lies and turns today 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 it is about the revision of the previous one 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.040
 honor systems as a whole is concerned 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.629
 with it around the third honor system which 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 is introduced to the game 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.500
 At the beginning there is the good tom chilton here 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.750
 a little look back as it 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 nevertheless with the first system which was 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.870
 from classic to burning crusade im 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.609
 use was 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.140
 Of course, this is not the case today 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.969
 more contemporary and has been before 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.300
 yes you have to say many many years 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.129
 replaced by the second system which 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.800
 We are currently still using 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.410
 This is currently easy and efficient 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.899
 but blizzard wanted to have something else 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.700
 something that stands out clearly 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.710
 from the pc sector 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.110
 and that's exactly the third one 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.960
 system free which simply yet 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.390
 one step further 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.509
 many always complain that pva and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.459
 pvp too confused it is 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.649
 There are many hotfixes in the classes 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.630
 for example, the just because of 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.580
 hit one or the other sector 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.660
 and we see the first picture here 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.459
 from the third yes honor system which then 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.929
 with the extension comes and we see 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.640
 that already here we have a kind 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.530
 experience beam at the we 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.110
 We can collect rewards 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.300
 So prestige can be seen 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.759
 and we have a kind of talent tree 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.739
 which we have additional skills or 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.080
 can unlock passive bonuses 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:00.800
 The us then of course in the pvp and also 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.270
 only in the pvp just continue to bring there 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.310
 then now here on the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.160
 presentation of blizzard on the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.830
 gamescom 2015 also a few small ones 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.530
 Examples of how this talent system 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.270
 for pvp an additional talent tree 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.940
 if you want to call it that 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.650
 for the pvp affects various 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.050
 skills you can do right now 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.220
 Just pause the video for a moment 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.200
 the whole thing in peace 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.840
 We read that for example 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.260
 here quick nick means a passive game 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.270
 is called by 15 percent and that 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.280
 means we just go through one 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.380
 can conjure up these passive faster 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.440
 but we also have other passive bonuses 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.820
 Which then just for all of us available 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.460
 are more or less but partial 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.610
 just class specific as well 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.950
 For example, a criticism strike should be made 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.710
 not only the pvp tvm more 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.380
 delimit and another alternative 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.880
 of the style of play but represent it 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.650
 should also class among each other 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.740
 more flexible and more individual again 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.660
 Make as much as you have so far 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.750
 to the active part but it works too 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.610
 Continue with the prestige ring and that is 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.380
 a thing that quite a few games 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.330
 are likely to be interested in the things 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.910
 unlock and the good tom chilton 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.770
 actually compares it a bit with 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.900
 call of duty if any of you 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.970
 knows and has played there before 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.340
 yes there is a similar system and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.069
 also wanted to be in front of power with prestige 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.040
 You can then work the prestige 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.450
 almost always continue to level up to 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.430
 a maximum and then the whole 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.260
 reset it for that one then 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.510
 back sets and again almost from scratch 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.120
 but you get a lot of different things 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.430
 rewards in the form of special 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.849
 skins for the artifact weapons in pvp 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.550
 or even maunz or for example that 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.470
 your own picture icon of the year 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.180
 symbol forth which one next to the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.520
 character can see there or rather 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.620
 the character head develops further 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.430
 For example, here we see it then and 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.470
 simply considerably more impressive 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.260
 by this mark on the character head 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.390
 then you can also recognize how 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 far the player because in prestige rank 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.709
 is or how much he has played here 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.569
 By the way, we will see a mount of 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.459
 the alliance is something for example here 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.510
 one also about the prestige ranks 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.069
 can unlock 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.190
 and take a look 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.810
 bit the artifact weapons 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.880
 These are sometimes the elementary 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.280
 feature of the upcoming extensions so 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.319
 also for the pvp players among you 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.229
 and there will be various skins that 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.389
 then just be unlocked in pvp 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.610
 through the prestige system and thereby 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.409
 just the character more individuality 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.150
 lend or on the other side 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.900
 like the other player or the other 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.389
 enemy players in open pvp show 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.800
 you are someone who plays a lot of pvp you 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.669
 be threatening, that should be better 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.979
 watch out 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.740
