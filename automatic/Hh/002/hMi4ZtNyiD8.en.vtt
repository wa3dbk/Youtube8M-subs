 far from 30 degrees and not 80% 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.379
 of moisture so the fingers 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.699
 it's difficult the skin is difficult 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.949
 and in the head it's hard

 in a feat that was carried out yesterday 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.070
 so certainly one of the spirits of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.320
 historic feat in the locker room is 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.850

 Here it would be so and its share 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.730
 bravo certainly all the rest of gt2 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.180

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.780
 or practices 8b plus it's not 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.520
 a new and I 30 in the woods have 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.810
 does each time larcher who after 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.320
 have tried the small products 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.580
 Protein good look of his muscles 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.010
 alizée also omaha beach one of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.590
 the more the nac the press are scratching at 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.370
 After its ultra-term project the rugby 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.380
 encounter some difficulties 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.930
 adhesion at the heel in the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.700
 stores bohicon but some tests 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.629
 later still by doing the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.280
 poached 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.260
 let's go back now to the bet between axel 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.209
 and cédric paris advance yalouz so 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.110
 since cédric typed his first 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.640
 basketball trials 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.290
 so we remind you of the purpose of 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.569
 paris it was necessary that these rules could 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.640
 realize this way in basketball 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.879
 a little again if it's true 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.290
 and that's the same way in basketball 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.329
 axel it would be him stretching his hair and 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.159
 the whole body but with regard to the 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.780
 disorganized hair and there is on his 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.939
 torso and maybe to salsa make it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.389
 So perhaps this day so many years 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.739
 in hair read how do you handle the 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.329
 pressure how do I see the pressure 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.200
 arm I handle it pretty well knowing 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.439
 that there is not really any pressure to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.849
 to have 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 you see a moment you have to know 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.719
 draw a line in the sand and then ben 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.239
 he will realize for himself I 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.530
 think top for you the belgian 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.799
 Franco-Swiss Israeli has no 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.409
 luck 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:02.349
 no he has no chance so a priori 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.349
 it is borat assured there it is brad 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.870
 finally to finish in the various facts 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.340
 besides the weather in croatian ivan 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.930
 capricious and the difficulty of both 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
 rappers did some performance 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.040
 you have to vary to a few occupations and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.480
 Roman he is particularly diligent 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.430
 in his English classes 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.989
 as you can see we know 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.150
 also from reliable source that sir 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.040
 adam ondra is present in the region 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.379
 but he is on the lookout for the best 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.030
 weather conditions so it would seem that 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.120
 the next big fat cross 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 can fall off here soon so that's 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.390
 the end of this edition we will
