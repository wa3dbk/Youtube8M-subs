you one more review this time I've got a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.550 
you one more review this time I've got a
hobby<00:00:22.769> king<00:00:23.039> offered<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.730> 10<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.660> 10<00:00:25.109> warthog

hobby king offered a 10 a 10 warthog

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.009 
hobby king offered a 10 a 10 warthog
pretty<00:00:25.920> famous<00:00:26.430> ground<00:00:27.180> attack<00:00:27.449> fighter<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
pretty famous ground attack fighter it's

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.470 
pretty famous ground attack fighter it's
primarily<00:00:28.470> designed<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.070> taking<00:00:29.670> out<00:00:29.789> tanks

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
primarily designed for taking out tanks

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
primarily designed for taking out tanks
kind<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> low<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> slow<00:00:31.619> setup<00:00:32.160> now<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
kind of a low and slow setup now this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
kind of a low and slow setup now this
one's<00:00:33.000> set<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.809> cool<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
one's set up really cool because it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.310 
one's set up really cool because it
looks<00:00:34.620> fairly<00:00:34.890> scale<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.820> ED<00:00:36.719> after<00:00:37.079> beefed

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
looks fairly scale the ED after beefed

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
looks fairly scale the ED after beefed
up<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> scale<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:38.910> just

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
up a little bit in scale but that's just

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
up a little bit in scale but that's just
so<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:39.809> power<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so you can get some power out of this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
so you can get some power out of this
thing<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.010> running<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> twin<00:00:42.210> 75

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
thing so it's running a twin 75

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
thing so it's running a twin 75
millimeter<00:00:43.290> electric<00:00:43.980> ducted<00:00:44.250> fan<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
millimeter electric ducted fan this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
millimeter electric ducted fan this
thing's<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.410> fun<00:00:46.710> I've<00:00:47.460> not

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
thing's actually really fun I've not

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
thing's actually really fun I've not
generally<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> massive<00:00:49.320> fan<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.910> edf's<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
generally a massive fan of edf's in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
generally a massive fan of edf's in
general<00:00:51.590> they're<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:53.070> you're<00:00:53.219> used<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
general they're just if you're used to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
general they're just if you're used to
prop<00:00:54.059> driven<00:00:54.270> stuff<00:00:54.809> though<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.350> feel<00:00:55.620> very

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
prop driven stuff though they feel very

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
prop driven stuff though they feel very
sluggish<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.579> throttle<00:00:56.879> response<00:00:57.090> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
sluggish on throttle response but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
sluggish on throttle response but
they're<00:00:57.750> very<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.350> high<00:00:58.530> speed<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.489> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they're very good for high speed so in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
they're very good for high speed so in
general<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.270> edf's<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> watch<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
general with edf's you want to watch it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.560 
general with edf's you want to watch it
try<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.850> small<00:01:03.210> field

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
try not to do any really small field

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
try not to do any really small field
stuff<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.670> takeoff<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
stuff you got to have some takeoff and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
stuff you got to have some takeoff and
landing<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.500> definitely<00:01:07.680> true

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
landing and that was definitely true

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
landing and that was definitely true
with<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.600> didn't<00:01:09.960> take<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.140> much

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
with this one it it didn't take too much

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.670 
with this one it it didn't take too much
too<00:01:11.159> much<00:01:11.189> takeoff<00:01:11.880> room<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
too much takeoff room just because it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
too much takeoff room just because it
has<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.670> amount<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> power<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.810> remember

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
has a good amount of power but remember

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.660 
has a good amount of power but remember
in<00:01:16.439> order<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> power<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
in order to get that power you have to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
in order to get that power you have to
have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> battery<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> able

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
have a battery that's going to be able

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
have a battery that's going to be able
to<00:01:19.229> supply<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.740> type<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> juice<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.939> I'd<00:01:21.570> say

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to supply that type of juice so I'd say

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
to supply that type of juice so I'd say
at<00:01:22.200> minimum<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> 25<00:01:23.310> seat<00:01:23.610> discharged

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
at minimum of a 25 seat discharged

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
at minimum of a 25 seat discharged
battery<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.900> 3-cell<00:01:25.530> 25c<00:01:26.310> discharged<00:01:26.790> battery

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
battery a 3-cell 25c discharged battery

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.300 
battery a 3-cell 25c discharged battery
would<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> least<00:01:28.650> i'd<00:01:28.799> recommend

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
would be about the least i'd recommend

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.810 
would be about the least i'd recommend
30<00:01:29.850> 35<00:01:30.860> something<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> nanotech<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.700> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
30 35 something like a nanotech would be

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
30 35 something like a nanotech would be
perfect<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.439> know<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.710> running

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
perfect because I you know even running

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.780 
perfect because I you know even running
my<00:01:35.310> my<00:01:35.729> 45<00:01:36.180> c<00:01:36.420> discharge<00:01:36.900> rated<00:01:37.380> nano<00:01:37.619> techs<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
my my 45 c discharge rated nano techs I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
my my 45 c discharge rated nano techs I
like<00:01:39.150> flying<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.540> thing<00:01:39.600> fast<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> was

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
like flying this thing fast so I was

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
like flying this thing fast so I was
running<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.189> full<00:01:41.310> throttle<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:41.909> portion

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
running at full throttle a good portion

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
running at full throttle a good portion
of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> time<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> batteries<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.380> warm

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of the time and the batteries got warm

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
of the time and the batteries got warm
they<00:01:44.250> didn't<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.610> hot<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> point<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
they didn't get hot to the point that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.639 
they didn't get hot to the point that
they<00:01:45.570> were<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.960> damaged<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.560> they

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
they were going to be damaged but they

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.580 
they were going to be damaged but they
did<00:01:46.860> definitely<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.579> warm<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.439> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
did definitely get warm so you know in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
did definitely get warm so you know in
general<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.759> did<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
general I really I really did like this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
general I really I really did like this
plane<00:01:51.930> quite<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> felt<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.490> scale<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
plane quite a bit it felt very scale and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
plane quite a bit it felt very scale and
how<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.630> flew<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.799> fun<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> do

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
how it flew it was really fun to do

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
how it flew it was really fun to do
rolls<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> didn't<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.630> didn't<00:01:58.079> want

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

wind<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.020> wouldn't<00:02:10.349> recommend

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
wind I probably wouldn't recommend

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.870 
wind I probably wouldn't recommend
lying<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.280> because<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
lying it just because you're going to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.660 
lying it just because you're going to
have<00:02:12.030> trouble<00:02:12.330> keeping<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.410> thing<00:02:13.650> lined<00:02:14.460> up

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
have trouble keeping the thing lined up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.010 
have trouble keeping the thing lined up
with<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.850> runway<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.390> you're<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.840> you're

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
with the runway if you're if you're

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.620 
with the runway if you're if you're
forced<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.620> land<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.130> certain<00:02:17.340> direction<00:02:17.630> so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
forced to land in a certain direction so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.780 
forced to land in a certain direction so
so<00:02:19.470> watch<00:02:19.650> yourself<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> cross<00:02:20.370> one<00:02:20.610> because

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so watch yourself in a cross one because

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
so watch yourself in a cross one because
it<00:02:20.880> has<00:02:21.000> no<00:02:21.180> rudder<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:21.720> I've<00:02:21.870> been<00:02:22.080> thinking

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
it has no rudder now I've been thinking

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.900 
it has no rudder now I've been thinking
about<00:02:22.530> how<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.160> rudder<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.640> here

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
about how to get a rudder in here

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.670 
about how to get a rudder in here
because<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.960> would<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.200> kind<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.470> cool

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
because I think it would be kind of cool

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.740 
because I think it would be kind of cool
to<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.490> throw<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> rudder<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.450> thing<00:02:27.630> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to to throw a rudder on this thing and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.350 
to to throw a rudder on this thing and
see<00:02:28.020> how<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.440> flies<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> rudder<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
see how it flies with a rudder but it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.450 
see how it flies with a rudder but it
looks<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.840> probably<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.380> single<00:02:31.920> servo<00:02:32.310> in

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
looks like probably a single servo in

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.730 
looks like probably a single servo in
the<00:02:32.490> center<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.750> lines<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.320> out<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the center with with lines going out to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.190 
the center with with lines going out to
the<00:02:34.770> rider<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> best<00:02:35.580> way<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the rider would be the best way to do it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.300 
the rider would be the best way to do it
you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.290> maybe<00:02:37.440> keep<00:02:37.680> an<00:02:37.770> eye<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you know maybe keep an eye out for a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.310 
you know maybe keep an eye out for a
video<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.840> really<00:02:40.140> happy

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
video on that but I was really happy

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.980 
video on that but I was really happy
with<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.770> thing<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.520> fun<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.150> quick<00:02:42.690> it's

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
with this thing it's fun it's quick it's

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.870 
with this thing it's fun it's quick it's
surprisingly<00:02:43.530> quick<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.070> not<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.790> know

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
surprisingly quick it's not you know

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.280 
surprisingly quick it's not you know
it's<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.450> flying<00:02:46.190> fast<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
it's not like a flying fast but it's a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.350 
it's not like a flying fast but it's a
furnace<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> scale<00:02:49.890> looking<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.730> 10<00:02:51.030> which

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
furnace for a scale looking a 10 which

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.090 
furnace for a scale looking a 10 which
the<00:02:51.570> plane<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.110> platform<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.650> plane<00:02:52.890> was

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the plane the platform of the plane was

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.040 
the plane the platform of the plane was
never<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.580> designed<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.750> quick

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
never really designed to be that quick

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.500 
never really designed to be that quick
to<00:02:55.260> begin<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:56.550> thing<00:02:56.790> was<00:02:57.000> pretty<00:02:57.209> fun

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
to begin with this thing was pretty fun

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
to begin with this thing was pretty fun
I<00:02:57.540> did<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.840> couple<00:02:57.990> high-speed<00:02:58.470> passes<00:02:58.920> pretty

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
I did a couple high-speed passes pretty

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.850 
I did a couple high-speed passes pretty
damn<00:02:59.580> close<00:02:59.910> to<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.270> head<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.709> was<00:03:01.830> a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
damn close to my head and and it was a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.650 
damn close to my head and and it was a
little<00:03:02.040> scary<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.610> know<00:03:02.730> cuz<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.060> see<00:03:03.330> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
little scary you know cuz they see you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.630 
little scary you know cuz they see you
know<00:03:03.750> EDS<00:03:04.200> make<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.830> special<00:03:05.400> noise

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
know EDS make a very special noise

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.160 
know EDS make a very special noise
they're<00:03:06.060> pretty<00:03:06.270> fun<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> hear<00:03:07.050> him

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
they're pretty fun you can hear him

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.010 
they're pretty fun you can hear him
resonate<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.950> more<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:09.990> I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
resonate a little more and you know I

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.540 
resonate a little more and you know I
had<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> lot<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.500> fun<00:03:10.740> flying<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.130> thing<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.430> was

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
had a lot of fun flying this thing I was

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.840 
had a lot of fun flying this thing I was
I<00:03:11.700> was<00:03:11.940> fairly<00:03:12.690> impressed<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.590> basic<00:03:14.490> setup

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
I was fairly impressed so basic setup

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.660 
I was fairly impressed so basic setup
there<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.600> nothing<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.670> started

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
there really was nothing to do I started

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580 
there really was nothing to do I started
out<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:17.910> setup<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.480> maximum<00:03:18.840> throws<00:03:19.320> on

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
out my setup with the maximum throws on

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.699 
out my setup with the maximum throws on
the<00:03:20.060> servo<00:03:21.060> horns<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.290> really<00:03:22.470> need

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the servo horns you don't really need

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.380 
the servo horns you don't really need
that<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.220> ended<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.700> flying<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.209> low

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
that I actually ended up flying on low

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.880 
that I actually ended up flying on low
rates<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> ended<00:03:25.170> up<00:03:25.260> dialing<00:03:25.680> those

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
rates and ended up dialing those

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.580 
rates and ended up dialing those
positions<00:03:26.250> back<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.030> start<00:03:27.720> about<00:03:27.900> midway<00:03:28.410> on

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
positions back so start about midway on

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.070 
positions back so start about midway on
your<00:03:28.769> servo<00:03:29.130> horns<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.360> would<00:03:30.959> recommend

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
your servo horns and I would recommend

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.690 
your servo horns and I would recommend
running<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.830> bit<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.070> expo<00:03:32.400> on<00:03:32.430> this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.910 
running a little bit of expo on this

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
because it is it's fairly touchy if you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.410 
because it is it's fairly touchy if you
have<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.100> lot<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.430> throw<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.239> like

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
have a lot of throw and if you like

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.910 
have a lot of throw and if you like
doing<00:03:36.660> barrel<00:03:36.870> rolls<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.380> loops<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.860> stuff

doing barrel rolls and loops and stuff

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.890 
doing barrel rolls and loops and stuff
like<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.430> kind<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.360> cutting<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> close

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
like that and kind of cutting it close

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.199 
like that and kind of cutting it close
then<00:03:40.320> make<00:03:40.950> sure<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.340> some<00:03:41.519> expo<00:03:41.850> set<00:03:42.060> up
