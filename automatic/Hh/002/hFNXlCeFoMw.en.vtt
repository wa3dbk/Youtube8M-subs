ducks and fish and reptiles and
amphibians<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.880> wolves<00:02:33.180> killed<00:02:33.450> coyotes<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
amphibians the wolves killed coyotes and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.280 
amphibians the wolves killed coyotes and
as<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.400> result<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.870> number<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
as a result of that the number of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.470 
as a result of that the number of
rabbits<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.070> mice<00:02:38.130> began<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.000> rise<00:02:39.180> which

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
rabbits and mice began to rise which

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.980 
rabbits and mice began to rise which
meant<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:40.230> Hawks<00:02:40.620> more<00:02:41.430> weasels<00:02:42.060> more<00:02:42.390> foxes

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
meant more Hawks more weasels more foxes

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.430 
meant more Hawks more weasels more foxes
more<00:02:43.500> badgers<00:02:44.180> Ravens<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.420> bald<00:02:45.660> eagles<00:02:45.870> came

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
more badgers Ravens and bald eagles came

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.110 
more badgers Ravens and bald eagles came
down<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.860> feed<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> carrion<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
down to feed on the carrion that the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.510 
down to feed on the carrion that the
Wolves<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.540> left<00:02:48.750> bears<00:02:49.440> fed<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> too<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
Wolves have left bears fed on it too and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.700 
Wolves have left bears fed on it too and
their<00:02:50.700> population<00:02:51.300> began<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> rise<00:02:51.990> as<00:02:52.230> well

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
their population began to rise as well

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.740 
their population began to rise as well
partly<00:02:53.280> also<00:02:53.520> because<00:02:53.790> there<00:02:54.510> were<00:02:54.600> more

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
partly also because there were more

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.750 
partly also because there were more
berries<00:02:55.290> growing<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.070> regenerating

berries growing on the regenerating

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.690 
berries growing on the regenerating
shrubs<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.900> Bears<00:02:58.490> reinforce<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
shrubs and the Bears reinforce the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.270 
shrubs and the Bears reinforce the
impact<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.330> wolves<00:03:00.780> by<00:03:01.230> killing<00:03:01.740> some<00:03:02.250> of

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
impact of the wolves by killing some of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
impact of the wolves by killing some of
the<00:03:02.430> calves<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.600> deer<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> here's<00:03:06.060> where

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
the calves of the deer but here's where

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.650 
the calves of the deer but here's where
it<00:03:06.390> gets<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.660> interesting<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:09.150> Wolves

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
it gets really interesting the Wolves

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.020 
it gets really interesting the Wolves
changed<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:11.430> behavior<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.750> rivers<00:03:14.030> they

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
changed the behavior of the rivers they

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.050 
changed the behavior of the rivers they
began<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.480> me<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.840> Alice<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.830> less

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
began to me and Alice there is less

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
began to me and Alice there is less
erosion<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.239> channels<00:03:18.720> narrowed<00:03:19.320> more

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
erosion that channels narrowed more

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.160 
erosion that channels narrowed more
pools<00:03:20.070> formed<00:03:20.700> more<00:03:21.060> rhythm<00:03:21.390> sections<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.050> of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
pools formed more rhythm sections all of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.660 
pools formed more rhythm sections all of
which<00:03:22.290> were<00:03:22.410> great<00:03:22.590> for<00:03:22.800> wildlife<00:03:23.220> habitats

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
which were great for wildlife habitats

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.560 
which were great for wildlife habitats
the<00:03:24.270> rivers<00:03:24.980> changed<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.670> response<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
the rivers changed in response to the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.930 
the rivers changed in response to the
wolves<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.920> reason<00:03:29.310> was<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
wolves and the reason was that the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.320 
wolves and the reason was that the
regenerating<00:03:30.739> forests<00:03:32.060> stabilized<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
regenerating forests stabilized the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.540 
regenerating forests stabilized the
banks<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.380> they<00:03:34.620> collapse<00:03:35.010> less<00:03:35.280> often

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
banks so that they collapse less often

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.790 
banks so that they collapse less often
so<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.120> rivers<00:03:36.420> became<00:03:36.900> more<00:03:37.170> fixed<00:03:37.650> in

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
so that the rivers became more fixed in

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.510 
so that the rivers became more fixed in
their<00:03:37.980> course<00:03:38.930> similarly<00:03:39.930> by<00:03:40.590> driving<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
their course similarly by driving the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.310 
their course similarly by driving the
deer<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.940> some<00:03:42.209> places<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
deer out of some places and the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.500 
deer out of some places and the
vegetation<00:03:43.800> recovering<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.300> valley

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
vegetation recovering on the valley

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.110 
vegetation recovering on the valley
sides<00:03:45.900> there<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.830> soil<00:03:47.190> erosion<00:03:47.550> because

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
sides there was a soil erosion because

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.690 
sides there was a soil erosion because
the<00:03:48.269> vegetation<00:03:48.870> stabilized<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.100> as<00:03:50.370> well

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
the vegetation stabilized that as well

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.520 
the vegetation stabilized that as well
so<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.200> Wolves<00:03:52.440> small<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.489> number<00:03:54.530> transform

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
so the Wolves small in number transform

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.800 
so the Wolves small in number transform
not<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.310> ecosystem<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
not just the ecosystem of the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.930 
not just the ecosystem of the
Yellowstone<00:03:58.290> National<00:03:58.320> Park<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:59.220> huge<00:03:59.550> area

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
Yellowstone National Park this huge area

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.730 
Yellowstone National Park this huge area
of<00:03:59.970> land

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
of land

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.860 
of land
but<00:04:01.070> also<00:04:01.390> its<00:04:02.390> physical<00:04:03.230> geography
