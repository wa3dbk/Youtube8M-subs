started begin the first 20 minutes but

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.210 
started begin the first 20 minutes but
then<00:04:23.970> they<00:04:24.090> really<00:04:24.270> start<00:04:24.330> saw<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.070> took<00:04:26.070> us

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
then they really start saw and took us

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.920 
then they really start saw and took us
that<00:04:26.940> be<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.240> again<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.780> gave<00:04:27.900> me

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
that be back again and it gave me

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.600 
that be back again and it gave me
another<00:04:28.139> few<00:04:28.350> chances<00:04:28.620> but<00:04:29.009> if<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.280> all<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.520> way

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
another few chances but if I all the way

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.740 
another few chances but if I all the way
Lydia<00:04:29.759> it's<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.120> first<00:04:30.300> thing<00:04:30.360> we've<00:04:30.570> really

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
Lydia it's the first thing we've really

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.140 
Lydia it's the first thing we've really
bad<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.289> I<00:04:31.560> think<00:04:32.009> once<00:04:32.370> we<00:04:32.460> got<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.789> first

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
bad so I think once we got the first

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150 
bad so I think once we got the first
goal<00:04:33.380> give<00:04:34.380> everybody<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.740> bit<00:04:34.860> corners

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
goal give everybody a bit corners

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.379 
goal give everybody a bit corners

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
because in recent games have been gone

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.570 
because in recent games have been gone
behind<00:04:36.630> so<00:04:36.990> they<00:04:37.289> go<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:37.949> front<00:04:38.099> and<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.400> was

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
behind so they go in front and it was

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.089 
behind so they go in front and it was
really<00:04:39.330> good<00:04:39.509> so<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:40.530> was<00:04:40.680> good<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.860> get<00:04:41.039> that

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099
