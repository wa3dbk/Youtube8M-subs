device the RX dr 800 SG which is a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.380 
device the RX dr 800 SG which is a
mouthful<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:16.250> i<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.670> hoping<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> show<00:00:18.330> you

mouthful so i was hoping to show you
this<00:00:18.810> same<00:00:19.109> format<00:00:19.970> that<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
this same format that we have for the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
this same format that we have for the
note<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> sony<00:00:23.100> reader<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.910> ePub<00:00:24.300> format

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
note and the sony reader the ePub format

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.320 
note and the sony reader the ePub format
with<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.189> material<00:00:27.029> moved<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
with the some of the material moved to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
with the some of the material moved to
the<00:00:27.449> side<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.260> fits<00:00:28.859> better<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the side so it's fits better on the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.060 
the side so it's fits better on the
screen<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> ir<00:00:30.300> x<00:00:30.560> but<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> doesn't<00:00:31.920> work

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
screen on the ir x but it doesn't work

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.760 
screen on the ir x but it doesn't work
yet<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.550> supposedly<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.600> new<00:00:33.870> firmware<00:00:34.320> coming

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
yet and supposedly a new firmware coming

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
yet and supposedly a new firmware coming
soon<00:00:35.010> we'll<00:00:35.280> fix<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.480> instead<00:00:36.780> we'll<00:00:36.930> do

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
soon we'll fix that so instead we'll do

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
soon we'll fix that so instead we'll do

Rex is it actually uses a stylus which
is<00:00:54.420> basically<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.410> required<00:00:55.949> because

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is basically which is required because

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
notice the ir x is really fast even with

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.539 
notice the ir x is really fast even with
this<00:01:32.579> huge<00:01:32.970> PDF<00:01:33.420> file<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> 120

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this huge PDF file which is about a 120

quick<00:01:43.070> formatting<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
quick formatting is not so good for the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
quick formatting is not so good for the
table<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.720> contents<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:48.649> obviously<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.920> can

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
table of contents but obviously you can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
table of contents but obviously you can
download<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> airport<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.750> on

download just the airport you want on
chart<00:01:52.170> bundle<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> do

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
chart bundle and you don't have to do

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
chart bundle and you don't have to do
the<00:01:54.390> whole<00:01:54.659> Southwest<00:01:55.259> volume<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.369> did

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the whole Southwest volume like I did

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
the whole Southwest volume like I did
here<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:57.920> demonstration<00:01:58.920> purposes<00:02:01.310> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
here for demonstration purposes it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.530 
here for demonstration purposes it
should<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.670> page<00:02:02.969> 40<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.600> believe<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
should be about page 40 I believe the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.089 
should be about page 40 I believe the
nor<00:02:06.540> firmware<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.110> also<00:02:07.469> let<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
nor firmware will also let you do this a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.110 
nor firmware will also let you do this a
little<00:02:08.280> faster<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.170> San<00:02:10.860> Francisco

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
little faster so San Francisco

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.750 
little faster so San Francisco
more<00:02:13.120> San<00:02:13.390> Francisco<00:02:14.220> still<00:02:15.220> more<00:02:15.490> San

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
more San Francisco still more San

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.640 
more San Francisco still more San
Francisco<00:02:17.010> San<00:02:18.010> Jose<00:02:22.650> Sacramento

that<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.440> let's<00:02:29.920> see<00:02:30.100> how<00:02:30.220> big<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.900> so

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that and let's see how big it is so

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580 
that and let's see how big it is so
still<00:02:33.130> smaller<00:02:33.430> than<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.730> paper

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
still smaller than the paper

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.530 
still smaller than the paper
significantly<00:02:35.590> bigger<00:02:35.800> than<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> note<00:02:36.540> so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
significantly bigger than the note so

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.460 
significantly bigger than the note so
let's<00:02:37.990> do<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.640> way<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.740> there<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.440> I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
let's do this this way so there is the I

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:58.240 
let's do this this way so there is the I
Rex

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.589 

here<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.670> nook<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:01.859> as<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.180> tell<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
here is the nook so as you can tell the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.399 
here is the nook so as you can tell the
nook<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.049> actually<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> tiny<00:03:05.760> bit<00:03:06.060> taller<00:03:06.409> you

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
nook is actually a tiny bit taller you

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:15.050 
nook is actually a tiny bit taller you
can't<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.250> see<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:11.450> narrower<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:14.609> a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
can't actually see and narrower so a

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.740 
can't actually see and narrower so a
pair<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> loops<00:03:17.329> which<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.569> wrong

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
pair of the loops which is the wrong

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.979 
pair of the loops which is the wrong
there<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:20.250> here's<00:03:20.640> our<00:03:20.760> paper<00:03:21.060> plate<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:23.989> better

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
there so here's our paper plate a better

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.789 
there so here's our paper plate a better
idea<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:27.980> smaller<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.930> still<00:03:31.290> fairly

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
idea here so smaller but still fairly

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.690 
idea here so smaller but still fairly
readable<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:34.500> can<00:03:34.769> actually<00:03:35.159> zoom<00:03:35.189> in<00:03:35.669> here

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
readable you can actually zoom in here

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:46.399 
readable you can actually zoom in here
enough<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:39.470> read<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:45.750> will<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.169> better

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
enough to read that so it will be better

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.800 
enough to read that so it will be better
you<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:47.040> once<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.879> ePub<00:03:48.599> format

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
you know once we have the ePub format

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.809 
you know once we have the ePub format
and<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.349> take<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.739> bottom<00:03:50.129> line<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.700> this

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and can take this bottom line and this

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.119 
and can take this bottom line and this
white<00:03:51.810> space<00:03:51.989> at<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.290> top<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.739> getting<00:03:53.010> on

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
white space at the top and getting on

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.140 
white space at the top and getting on
the<00:03:53.250> sides<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.799> other<00:03:56.340> thing<00:03:56.459> though<00:03:56.909> that

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the sides so the other thing though that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.229 
the sides so the other thing though that
I<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.629> say<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.079> at<00:03:58.200> Rex<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:59.239> it's

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
I have to say about the at Rex is it's

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.300 
I have to say about the at Rex is it's
really<00:04:00.750> quite<00:04:01.409> fast<00:04:05.299> imperative<00:04:06.299> Lee<00:04:07.310> even

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
really quite fast imperative Lee even

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.369 
really quite fast imperative Lee even
for<00:04:08.459> this<00:04:08.579> huge<00:04:08.909> file<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.849> let's<00:04:12.449> do<00:04:12.930> one<00:04:13.169> last

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
for this huge file so let's do one last

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.759 
for this huge file so let's do one last
comparison<00:04:14.129> here<00:04:14.489> which<00:04:14.909> is<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.299> our<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:16.440> view

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
comparison here which is to our to view

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.640 
comparison here which is to our to view
on<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.579> nook<00:04:20.570> now<00:04:21.570> different<00:04:22.169> different

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
on the nook now different different

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.750 
on the nook now different different
runway<00:04:23.520> here<00:04:23.820> but

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.560 

34<00:04:31.760> left<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:33.970> obviously<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.180> smaller<00:04:35.450> than

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
34 left so obviously it's smaller than

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.320 
34 left so obviously it's smaller than
the<00:04:35.780> two<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.830> note<00:04:37.040> but<00:04:38.000> once

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
the two of you on the note but once

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.200 
the two of you on the note but once
again<00:04:38.510> once<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.140> have<00:04:39.170> PDF<00:04:39.850> will<00:04:40.850> be<00:04:40.970> able<00:04:41.150> to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
again once we have PDF will be able to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.950 
again once we have PDF will be able to
do<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.510> lot<00:04:41.690> bigger<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:43.360> one<00:04:44.360> quick<00:04:44.690> final

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
do that a lot bigger and one quick final

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.730 
do that a lot bigger and one quick final
thing<00:04:46.180> see<00:04:47.180> how<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.450> works<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:50.120> can<00:04:50.270> just

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
thing see how this works or you can just

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.660 
thing see how this works or you can just
do<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:53.500> well<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.980> doesn't<00:04:55.280> zoom<00:04:55.430> yet

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
do that and well it doesn't zoom yet

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.090 
do that and well it doesn't zoom yet
also<00:04:56.510> supposedly<00:04:57.170> in<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.740> next<00:04:57.950> firmware

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
also supposedly in the next firmware

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.030 
also supposedly in the next firmware
thanks<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.880> lot
