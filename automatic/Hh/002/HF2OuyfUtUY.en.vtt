00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 him hello to all and so in this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 video i'm going to show you so how 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.200
 do not scratch a dvd or cd when you have 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.920
 more than jacques is so simply you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 have your cd so you're going to put 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.930
 like those here and there I'm going to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.029
 so present something that costs 2 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.420
 4 5 euros maximum so is this if it's 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.179
 an orange spell and the cds or whatever 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 you simply put the cds as 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.040
 this makes us take for example the cd 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.309
 from michael jackson hop you go 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 go back like these and Wolof and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 was waiting like this so here I have 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.739
 after that yes change the liners 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.980
 well I'm not too jacket that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.600
 I lost again so here it is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.550
 it is rather one that cuts to the rows 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.510
 in a closet after I have another 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 solution that is more original level 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 deco so this is one of the so what is it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.280
 a death this so one of her that one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.560
 pushes on a drawer in fact we just 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 to press on it and there we will take 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 so this is so we can see two 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.610
 cd which you will take a little empty 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.509
 has only 1 winne that gives this so 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 here is nothing to give up 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.689
 here is an empty one 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.170
 so here I 'm going to take my cd that 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.110
 I had at the beginning and we will insert it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 so this is how it is 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.189
 do not damage anything and we can put two 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 on each cover 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 then we took and we orange like those 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.360
 see here and we roll so that's so 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.399
 there is more another style of decoration 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.969
 so to put in a room or 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.539
 other so frankly that's it 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.910

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.750
