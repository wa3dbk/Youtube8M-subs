00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
not to like about this is it's not as

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.160 
not to like about this is it's not as
mobile<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:17.000> want<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.989> mobile

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
mobile as you would want but mobile

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.990

enough<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:18.980> pull<00:02:19.549> off<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.730> lot<00:02:19.970> of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
enough where you can pull off a lot of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.030 
enough where you can pull off a lot of
poses<00:02:20.510> only<00:02:21.319> reason<00:02:21.530> why<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.680> say<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.890> is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
poses only reason why I say that is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.800 
poses only reason why I say that is
because<00:02:22.160> when<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.090> try<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.269> pose<00:02:23.510> them<00:02:23.690> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
because when you do try to pose them and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.449 
because when you do try to pose them and
you<00:02:23.870> try<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:23.989> splay<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.440> cape<00:02:24.650> which

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
you try to splay out the cape which

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.620 
you try to splay out the cape which
actually<00:02:25.670> does<00:02:26.090> move<00:02:26.329> around<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:31.459> does<00:02:32.239> get<00:02:32.480> in

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
actually does move around it does get in

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.720 
actually does move around it does get in
the<00:02:32.660> way<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.349> elbows<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.549> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
the way of the elbows because of the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.589 
the way of the elbows because of the
pointy<00:02:35.410> kind<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.650> Batman<00:02:37.489> ish<00:02:37.670> elbow

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
pointy kind of like Batman ish elbow

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.069 
pointy kind of like Batman ish elbow
like<00:02:39.349> gloves<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.970> you'd<00:02:41.329> have<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.660> kind<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.930> be

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
like gloves so you'd have to kind of be

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.020 
like gloves so you'd have to kind of be
tricky<00:02:42.470> about<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.860> when<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.190> do<00:02:43.370> pose<00:02:43.670> him

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
tricky about it when you do pose him

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.819 
tricky about it when you do pose him

like<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:47.019> maybe<00:02:48.019> that's<00:02:48.290> why<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> other

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
like that maybe that's why the other

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.960 
like that maybe that's why the other
capes<00:02:49.610> are<00:02:49.910> there<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.510> do<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.870> pose<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.790> key
