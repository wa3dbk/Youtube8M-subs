obviously what's happened in our story
we've<00:01:58.890> we've<00:01:59.189> messed<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.579> mess<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> around<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we've we've messed it mess it around a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
we've we've messed it mess it around a
little<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> suit<00:02:01.200> our<00:02:01.380> own<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.130> suit<00:02:02.340> our

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
own devices and you know as you say I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.670 
own devices and you know as you say I
think<00:02:06.630> fans<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.990> been<00:02:07.110> able<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> still

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
think fans have been able to still

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.589 
think fans have been able to still
relate<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> despite<00:02:08.550> us<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> chopping

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
relate to it despite us kind of chopping

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.690 
relate to it despite us kind of chopping
and<00:02:09.810> changing<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> legend

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and changing the legend

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.670 
and changing the legend
you<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.909> it<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.659> be<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.230> will<00:02:13.409> end

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you think it will be like that will end

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
you think it will be like that will end
at<00:02:13.829> a<00:02:13.859> point<00:02:14.099> where<00:02:14.489> he's<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.939> we<00:02:15.689> have<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
at a point where he's that we have the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.330 
at a point where he's that we have the
round<00:02:16.079> table<00:02:16.469> and<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:16.859> that<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.159> or<00:02:17.250> do

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
round table and we have that thing or do

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.949 
round table and we have that thing or do
you<00:02:17.400> think<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:18.030> might<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.540> might<00:02:18.689> see<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you think it might we might see that

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.369 
you think it might we might see that
before<00:02:19.349> like<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.890> actual<00:02:20.189> end<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.489> show<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
before like the actual end of the show I

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.170 
before like the actual end of the show I
that's<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.769> interesting<00:02:23.069> question<00:02:23.430> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that's a very interesting question it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.910 
that's a very interesting question it
would<00:02:24.359> be<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:25.140> interested<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.680> what

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
would be is to be interested to see what

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.020 
would be is to be interested to see what
they<00:02:26.069> would<00:02:26.159> do<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.489> they<00:02:26.519> brought<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.000> in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
they would do if they brought it in

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.619 
they would do if they brought it in
earlier

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
earlier

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.319 
earlier
what<00:02:28.109> would<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.439> would<00:02:28.560> suggest<00:02:28.799> ie<00:02:29.219> I<00:02:29.700> think

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
what would they would suggest ie I think

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.599 
what would they would suggest ie I think
when<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> show<00:02:30.719> comes<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.530> an<00:02:31.620> end<00:02:31.889> what<00:02:32.579> I

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
when the show comes to an end what I

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.030 
when the show comes to an end what I
would<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.540> after<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> position

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
would like to see is after in a position

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.390 
would like to see is after in a position
where<00:02:35.250> he's<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.859> now<00:02:38.010> he's<00:02:38.250> able

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
where he's able to do it now he's able

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.959 
where he's able to do it now he's able
to<00:02:38.700> take<00:02:39.000> control<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.760> would<00:02:41.939> be

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
to take control and you know it would be

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.149 
to take control and you know it would be
a<00:02:42.090> stage<00:02:42.450> where<00:02:42.689> he<00:02:43.049> doesn't<00:02:43.680> necessarily

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
a stage where he doesn't necessarily

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.640 
a stage where he doesn't necessarily
need<00:02:44.639> Merlin<00:02:45.030> anymore<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.659> think<00:02:46.169> that's<00:02:46.470> where

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
need Merlin anymore I think that's where

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.039 
need Merlin anymore I think that's where
the<00:02:46.769> show<00:02:46.950> would<00:02:47.099> probably<00:02:47.370> come<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.669> this<00:02:47.730> end

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the show would probably come to this end

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.690 
the show would probably come to this end
whether<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.379> before<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:49.829> after<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
whether that be before or after the you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.640 
whether that be before or after the you
know<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.970> nicely<00:02:51.689> round<00:02:51.870> table<00:02:52.260> we'll<00:02:52.439> see

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
know the nicely round table we'll see

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.280 
know the nicely round table we'll see
but<00:02:52.980> some<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.239> know<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.510> show<00:02:54.720> saw<00:02:54.959> I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
but some I think you know the show saw I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.770 
but some I think you know the show saw I
guess<00:02:55.950> ends<00:02:56.219> when<00:02:56.489> after<00:02:56.790> story<00:02:57.060> begins

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
guess ends when after story begins

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.599 
guess ends when after story begins
have<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.319> if<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.769> started<00:02:59.010> shooting<00:02:59.159> see<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
have you if you started shooting see I

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.099 
have you if you started shooting see I
know<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.939> have<00:03:00.030> season<00:03:00.299> five<00:03:00.510> coming<00:03:00.810> up<00:03:00.900> in

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
know you have season five coming up in

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.690 
know you have season five coming up in
the<00:03:01.319> UK<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.069> they<00:03:02.189> just<00:03:02.219> picked<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.579> for

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
the UK but would they just picked up for

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.659 
the UK but would they just picked up for

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
season four for a sideline well we would

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.509 
season four for a sideline well we would

we're about nine episodes the way

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.849 
we're about nine episodes the way
through<00:03:11.159> and<00:03:11.489> I'm<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.260> keep<00:03:13.260> saying<00:03:13.349> I'm

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
through and I'm as I keep saying I'm

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.860 
through and I'm as I keep saying I'm
most<00:03:14.549> excited<00:03:14.760> about<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.299> year<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.690> cuz

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
most excited about this year just cuz

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.289 
most excited about this year just cuz
I've<00:03:15.959> been<00:03:16.079> journey<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.680> much<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.239> think

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
I've been journey it so much and I think

that<00:03:18.540> will<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.139> think<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.949> will<00:03:20.040> translate

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that will I think that will translate

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.789 
that will I think that will translate
into<00:03:20.639> into<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:21.540> actual<00:03:21.840> show<00:03:21.989> itself<00:03:22.260> I'm

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
into into the actual show itself I'm

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.520
