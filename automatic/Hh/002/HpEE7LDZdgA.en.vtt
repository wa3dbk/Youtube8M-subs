 comes to prepare homemade clay 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.779
 wonderful because then one spends a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 money on the plates those that should 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 of the measures you spend a lot and this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.529
 Plasticine is very simple and with 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 materials that we have in the house today 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 let's go in one is toxic of that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.079
 it is also wonderful moment we have 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.760
 little green in the house imagine 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 that sometimes like they are tempted 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 to eat it there are not even mothers here 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 they will be calm and clear to see 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.149
 let's start mine heidi how are we going 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 to do 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.920
 then I tell them the recipe and that we 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 pass the recipe and this one in pantallita 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 let's see the ingredients 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.520
 we will need a cup of flour 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.780
 wheat ok 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.199
 half a cup of this salt a teaspoon 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.540
 of oil olive oil any you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.270
 anyone can be 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.070
 and a half teaspoon of baking powder 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.710
 they are the ingredients now very 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 easy and we will place who now 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.740
 I previously placed a cup of water 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 that is the proportion can do the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.120
 amount they want to say that this is 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.740
 the basic recipe with these ingredients 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.479
 we made how many balls we are going to 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.470
 get out of plasticine let's get more or 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.470
 less this amount 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.580
 exactly let's take the salt first 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.159
 let's dissolve the room here in the water 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.540
 that is warm you do not have to 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.140
 is boiling only is for 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.110
 dissolve today is because today is because 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.390
 looking for good is a bit to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.950
 preservatives here I am applying the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.869
 baking powder 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.920
 it's sodium bicarbonate that's why 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.869
 it does if it bubbles ok and the oil of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 dinner will be like a kind of 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.300
 preservative not because this we're going to 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.239
 create is a mass a mass really a 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.519
 dough like cooking can even be 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.500
 eat as I said does not have a taste 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.470
 so nice effect that you love the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.390
 That's how it works but this allows it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.550
 that lasts a little behind mamacita not 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.079
 as a machine plus and such and then that 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.610
 it's more or less our food 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.770
 facebook feed 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.780
 and then we're going to apply the flour 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.870
 wheat need to be of little 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.870
 little can be a flour force of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 wheat flour I have cornstarch in my house 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.040
 it does not have to be flour from 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.350
 wheat and here if you help us here with the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.540
 camera whenever you want to thicken clear 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.050
 then what we are going to do is cook 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.200
 the dough and it's going to thicken and it's going to 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.510
 go detaching sees it this diet today 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 and of course with the oil, what helped 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.430
 so that it does not stick exactly 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.230
 so that it does not stick and mireia already was and 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.810
 we leave it at the moment of refilling the strip 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.100
 to be able to give by burning atmosphere ok of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.630
 done in this activity you can 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.160
 involve the little ones we are going to 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.140
 turn off this camera so that also the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.520
 make it right now 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.500
 maybe not so much because it's a little 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.350
 hot but after these we have it 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.570
 to knead true here but look now 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.940
 It has texture knows a lot of change 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.380
 it's hot - to hot but look at 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 decide the color because it comes here 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.830
 we will see that he is still in this 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.540
 half white but what they like 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.980
 the colors exact milestones then for 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.840
 that their crafts can do 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.790
 kids in this house that I have here 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.860
 It is done 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.799
 posada is the texture that is like this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.840
 softly and what we are going to do is 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.739
 apply here of rum bits 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.629
 make her feel the difference ok for 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.609
 place it and color the then something 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.530
 nothing more beautiful if you want to take 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.750
 color that you want very Ã¡lava to color 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.540
 of green now we were going to put him 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.250
 vegetable plant coloring droplets 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.230
 because because all this that we are 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.359
 making is edible true so that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.670
 four sachets the charteres I put 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.700
 four droplets of country put or 8 of 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.409
 more beautiful pears with stronger gas going 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.000
 to be the true color and where we can 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.829
 buy all these ingredients from the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.689
 dyes or all these cooking or 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.099
 be all you can buy this for me 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.530
 here I will be with all hands 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.450
 green but here we will go 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.389
 massaging and you're going to have your little ball 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.039
 color and you can create all the colors 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.509
 what you want and suddenly you can go 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.310
 combining that are the basics that 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.599
 we had already talked about being continuous 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.599
 the blue blue 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.730
 Then before buying all the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.220
 ranges of colors 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.860
 during this they sell red yellow green 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.720
 and blue and can combine it then and here 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.090
 It's a matter of massaging what's right 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.920
 as you can see, it's like that 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.140
 while you knead it more 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.240
 happening and is completely uniform 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.710
 you know he 's father in a mesh 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.840
 do it to the children but as now 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.580
 I commented at the beginning to put them to them 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.370
 obviously they saw the fire because 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.080
 It is not a bit dangerous either, but if 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.430
 they can be combined and winnowing 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.320
 ingredients and then do them 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.720
 same and since we have our list 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.970
 little house looks is the marsh can see 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.700
 make figurines what I bought them 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.890
 this is this account come out and go 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.980
 he brought the moms at home that they can 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.900
 incorporate in a box cutters of 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.850
 cookies for example to carry 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.410
 figurines at home is not about 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.600
 any supermarket in any 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.370
 supermarket and they are very economical and for 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.070
 a gift for tomorrow for the day of the 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.810
 child store the balls in bags of 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.810
 that pays it clear and then you put it on 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.020
 so you can see the people that can be 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.000
 look that is soft was in 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.280
 against we have the Chinese lines if not 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.710
 they are bothering the line and they are on 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.960
 look and it's equally if you want the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.640
 Manito a little bit harder no more 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.500
 like the clay as 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.270
 purchases you can put a little more 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.980
 true flour but I like this one 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.190
 texture because it makes me like that 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:59.160
 soft little playful and no longer reaches a 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.530
 hospital and if there is a hippopotamus there goes 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.720
 now something happens for a girl there we go 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.640
 I think it's good to make a little pile 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.920
 idea that the little yellow heart 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.200
 I was going to take off to crush him a little bit 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.640
 the mega a little bit we're also going to get 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.110
 someone in the hands and suddenly 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.820
 we want them not to be peeled not for 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.590
 because it's like that a little bit but this 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.260
 quote I store it in these sachets 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.080
 aha so that they keep a little 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.760
 no humidity but what can we do to 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.800
 that does not stick so much you can 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.980
 let air a little bit before 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.280
 play the little ones to dry 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.720
 likewise store it in these 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.970
 bags for you to last harder 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.980
