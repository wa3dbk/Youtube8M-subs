00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.350
I think the piano is the
most complete instrument.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.480
It is rhythm, melody, and harmony

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.020
plus its construction is that
of a percussion instrument.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.130
For these and more reasons,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.530
it has always transcended as
the instrument par excellence.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.400
The piano can be used

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.650
to play boleros, or to play ballads

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.510
You can use the piano to play merengue

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.310
a classic style from the Dominican Republic

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.940
You can use it to play son,
like I demonstrated

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.420
You can use it to play music including

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.450
effects like harp

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.230
You can also use it to play
percussive effects like this:

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.910
The effects you create

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.340
have a feel of percussion

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.230
You have to know where to apply the piano

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.270
and how you will use the piano

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220
If the piano is going to be inside a group

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.270
playing dance music

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.060
It will be heard

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.120
rhythmically, harmonically and melodically

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.320
Why? Because the tumbaos

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.910
are going to have rhythms that
correspond to a harmony and melody

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.900
But inside the tumbao there are times

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.290
when the piano plays:

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.990
At this moment the piano
is playing harmonically

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.740
The piano can do this:

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.480
At this moment it is playing harmonically

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.250
but it is also playing
rhythmically with that figure

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.310
I think that the important thing to know

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.260
Is a question of the percussive

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.840
utilization in the tumbao

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.980
binding the melodic effects

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.980
and the harmony

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.710
because you can't play tumbao
without thinking of the harmony

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.630
You have to think in your mind
what kind of tumbao you will play, chords...

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.400
or like Cuban montunos,
or like American swing

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:09.270
For example I can play in Latin jazz
this take on A Train

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.820
Here we combined the harmonic and rhythmic

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.620
Inside the improvisation some
elements of jazz improvisation

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.120
Other elements from Cuban
music improvisation

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.830
All of this depends on the skill and
knowledge of the player

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.000
Understanding the clave is very important

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.740
for playing Cuban music or Latin jazz

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.690
In Cuban son

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.960
it is the internal clave that needs
to be internally developed and mastered

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.550
You can have have a more open harmony

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.810
You can add different tonalities
either richer or more simple
