opinion I didn't come on here and I

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.080 
opinion I didn't come on here and I

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
wasn't necessary I didn't feel it was

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.470 
wasn't necessary I didn't feel it was
worth<00:03:29.920> reviewing<00:03:30.489> raw<00:03:30.790> because<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.180> wasn't<00:03:31.450> a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
worth reviewing raw because it wasn't a

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.420
