it's<00:01:31.600> more<00:01:31.830> pigmented<00:01:32.830> than<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.400> but<00:01:34.119> um<00:01:34.330> it

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
it's more pigmented than that but um it

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.900 
it's more pigmented than that but um it
kind<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.590> has<00:01:35.920> like<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> guest<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.610> little

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
kind of has like a guest like a little

like<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.060> brownish<00:01:37.660> pink<00:01:38.140> if<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.680> could<00:01:38.890> say

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
like a brownish pink if you could say

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.399 
like a brownish pink if you could say

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:06.820 

you

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.060 

so<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.229> really<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.500> color<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:09.830> lot

used<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.489> wearing<00:03:00.670> Reds<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.299> pigmented<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
used to wearing Reds this pigmented so

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.440 
used to wearing Reds this pigmented so
this<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.709> really<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.069> nice<00:03:03.340> change<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:03.970> me<00:03:04.120> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
this is really a nice change for me it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.559 
this is really a nice change for me it
really<00:03:04.959> stands<00:03:05.319> out<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.739> my<00:03:06.390> eyeliner<00:03:07.390> would

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
really stands out so my eyeliner would

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.470 
really stands out so my eyeliner would
probably<00:03:08.080> be<00:03:08.319> like<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:09.129> maybe<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.090> little<00:03:10.239> bit

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
probably be like this maybe a little bit

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.569 
probably be like this maybe a little bit
less<00:03:10.810> I'm<00:03:11.709> not<00:03:11.860> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.069> do<00:03:12.159> too<00:03:12.310> much<00:03:12.459> with

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
less I'm not going to do too much with

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.300 
less I'm not going to do too much with
my<00:03:12.670> eyes<00:03:12.909> when<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:13.930> wearing<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.349> lip<00:03:15.099> but

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
my eyes when I'm wearing this lip but

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.190 
my eyes when I'm wearing this lip but
again<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.000> think<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.450> complements<00:03:17.079> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
again I think it complements the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.750 
again I think it complements the
contacts<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:18.040> well<00:03:18.190> too<00:03:18.430> with<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.909> look

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.199 

it's<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:24.879> really<00:03:25.120> dark<00:03:26.160> purple<00:03:27.160> color<00:03:27.849> and

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
it's like a really dark purple color and

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.940 
it's like a really dark purple color and
I<00:03:28.239> have<00:03:28.420> not<00:03:28.569> really<00:03:28.900> used<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.260> much<00:03:29.349> yet<00:03:29.410> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
I have not really used it much yet I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.280 
I have not really used it much yet I
