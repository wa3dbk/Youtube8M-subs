00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:42.249 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.139 

thing<00:05:42.489> that<00:05:42.639> we<00:05:42.849> become<00:05:43.689> better<00:05:45.149> but

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.149 
thing that we become better but

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:47.249 
thing that we become better but
obviously<00:05:46.479> it's<00:05:46.719> not<00:05:46.779> going<00:05:46.929> to<00:05:47.019> get<00:05:47.079> any

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
obviously it's not going to get any

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.029 
obviously it's not going to get any
easier<00:05:47.489> the<00:05:48.489> second<00:05:48.819> half<00:05:48.909> of<00:05:49.029> the<00:05:49.089> season<00:05:49.299> and

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
easier the second half of the season and

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.799 
easier the second half of the season and
we<00:05:51.039> just<00:05:51.219> have<00:05:51.339> to<00:05:51.459> be<00:05:51.489> prepared<00:05:52.059> mentally<00:05:52.599> and

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:52.809 
we just have to be prepared mentally and

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:56.699 
we just have to be prepared mentally and
physically<00:05:53.199> to<00:05:53.469> face<00:05:54.099> what<00:05:54.399> was<00:05:54.639> coming<00:05:55.709> so

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
physically to face what was coming so

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.529
