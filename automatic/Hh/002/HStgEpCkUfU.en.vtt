00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
asked me to do more of a close-up of the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.550 
asked me to do more of a close-up of the
modified<00:00:05.730> whitetail<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.629> how<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.319> actually

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
modified whitetail and how it actually

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.980 
modified whitetail and how it actually
works<00:00:08.840> well<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:10.860> see<00:00:11.540> I've<00:00:12.540> got<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
works well as you can see I've got the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
works well as you can see I've got the
pad<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.530> flip<00:00:13.740> over<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.280> top<00:00:14.420> instead<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
pad to flip over the top instead of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.349 
pad to flip over the top instead of
underneath<00:00:16.490> now<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.330> don't

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
underneath now this is so that you don't

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.540 
underneath now this is so that you don't
have<00:00:18.630> any<00:00:18.779> problems<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> closing<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
have any problems with the closing out

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.269 
have any problems with the closing out
doesn't<00:00:21.510> interfere<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.260> bottom<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
doesn't interfere with the bottom of the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
doesn't interfere with the bottom of the
window<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:25.019> got<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> couple<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
window at all it's got a couple of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
window at all it's got a couple of
little<00:00:25.740> ties<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.609> they<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.849> act<00:00:27.269> as

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
little ties on there they just act as

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.320 
little ties on there they just act as
Springs<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> wagtail<00:00:30.090> will

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
Springs so that the wagtail will

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.650 
Springs so that the wagtail will
actually<00:00:30.900> centralize<00:00:31.759> now<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.969> helps<00:00:33.390> when

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually centralize now this helps when

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.680 
actually centralize now this helps when
you<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> use<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> actual<00:00:35.219> wagtail<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you want to use the actual wagtail so it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.770 
you want to use the actual wagtail so it
doesn't<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.340> interfere<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.780> top

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
doesn't actually interfere with the top

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.040 
doesn't actually interfere with the top
of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> house<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:42.000> works<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of the house it works really well and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110 
of the house it works really well and
you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:43.950> better<00:00:44.219> control<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you can get much better control with it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.139 
you can get much better control with it
you<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.530> detail<00:00:47.010> tool<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:47.969> got

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you see the little detail tool I've got

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
you see the little detail tool I've got
there<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> wipe<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> top<00:00:49.739> edge<00:00:49.950> that's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
there you can wipe the top edge that's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
there you can wipe the top edge that's
usually<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.059> edge<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> needs<00:00:51.690> doing

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
usually the only edge that needs doing

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
usually the only edge that needs doing
and<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.590> held<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> these

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and it's held on with one of these

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
and it's held on with one of these
little<00:00:53.930> crocodile<00:00:54.930> clips<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:56.250> usually

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in future videos but anyway let's do a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
in future videos but anyway let's do a
window<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.310> imagine<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
window with it just imagine it's on a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.960 
window with it just imagine it's on a
long<00:01:12.210> pole<00:01:12.540> okay<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.070> first<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.850> all

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
long pole okay here we go first of all

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.070 
long pole okay here we go first of all
you<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> pad<00:01:15.840> flipped<00:01:16.200> over<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> front

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
you have the pad flipped over the front

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.120 
you have the pad flipped over the front
you<00:01:19.080> come<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.119> wet<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> window

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
you come up like this wet the window

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.109 
you come up like this wet the window
imagine<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> window<00:01:24.420> upstairs<00:01:24.840> right

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
imagine this is a window upstairs right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
soap it up and the pad actually flips

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
soap it up and the pad actually flips
backwards<00:01:30.180> you'll<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
backwards you'll get very good at that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.499 
backwards you'll get very good at that
if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.490> try<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.229> blade<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> need

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
if you try it you can blade it you need

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
if you try it you can blade it you need
to<00:01:36.630> cut<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> top<00:01:37.470> edge<00:01:39.650> then<00:01:40.650> straight

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to cut in the top edge then straight

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.800 
to cut in the top edge then straight
strokes<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.030> best<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> window<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.170> this

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
strokes is best on a window like this

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.990 
strokes is best on a window like this
tap<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> top<00:01:47.630> cut<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.750> again<00:01:50.000> angle

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
tap it on the top cut in again angle

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.780 
tap it on the top cut in again angle
down<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> center<00:01:53.659> finish<00:01:54.659> off

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
down to the center finish off

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.730 
down to the center finish off
and<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.690> turn<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.380> till<00:01:57.770> round<00:01:59.320> and<00:02:00.320> use<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
and you turn the till round and use the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.950 
and you turn the till round and use the
detailing<00:02:01.190> tool<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.700> go

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.610 

then<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.520> take<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.820> tool<00:02:11.060> off<00:02:14.470> get<00:02:15.470> your

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
then you can take the tool off get your

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.430 
then you can take the tool off get your
sill<00:02:15.830> tool<00:02:16.070> out<00:02:16.540> put<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.840> that's<00:02:18.230> what

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
sill tool out put that on that's what

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.720 
sill tool out put that on that's what
this<00:02:18.560> would<00:02:18.740> look<00:02:18.770> like<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:21.280> wipes<00:02:22.280> across

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
this would look like just wipes across

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
this would look like just wipes across
like<00:02:23.000> that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
like that
