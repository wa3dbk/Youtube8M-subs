 I will go there after obviously 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320
 when you grow up there are plenty of guys who 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.240
 stay at home in the football one is in a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 group of friends you can easily burn 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 but who does not know too much it's him 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.370
 who always asks this question this is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 when psg om and me when i'm at home 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.819
 me and I watch a football match 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.989
 I always have the same curse it is 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.640
 that I watch during the forty 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.140
 minutes where nothing happens and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.910
 young people are looking for something to drink ago 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.959
 the most votes that needed especially 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 not miss right now between the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.760
 left and right was going henry anelka 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.739
 oh no i will miss fucking after me 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.300
 there is something I do not understand it is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.980
 than in football games on TV at 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.140
 a moment ago there is a list of numbers 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 who is showing up so everyone does not care 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.470
 completely 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.690
 like shooting shots the possession of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.370
 the ball the ashes no but what is it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.099
 this delirium kind the coach he's going 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.959
 happen like that in the locker room for 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.330
 later cases it is not possible to 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.340
 5.0 for proof iis7 payne defeat this is 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.810
 a wicked hockey on the other hand I have the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.330
 figures then 70% of possession of the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.209
 bullet is not too bad nine shots 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.430
 framed flows and only from fo whose 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.670
 listen to you guys all at the restaurant 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.959
 tonight it's me that feasted on that 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 is really going like this actually 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.290
 highway that for that after me there is a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.209
 last thing I do not understand it's 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.599
 footballers who will be based all 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.060
 day 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.980
 jogging like that's true what is that 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.120
 guys at one point they imagine that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.459
 in a normal big line 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.549
 it will happen and if you did not see it 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 the movie gravity name of what but was 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.269
 I believe his drawings fimec 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.269
 astronauts and all khabar and vattenfall 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.260
 Anyway it's a little ridiculous that it 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.239
 does not mean that it's in normal 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.650
 they would happen it helps me is that 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:04.480
 jean saint chinian de bedos the yeah 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.040
 yeah frankly it's great but then 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.230
 if you too like to fuck them 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.260
 penalties or corners of benches 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.260
 touch 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.109
 benoÃ®t mashaie and then go on my 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.660
 twitter 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.280
 and then if you do that and well I 'm going 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.840
 to be happy that here I am happy I 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.300

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.300
