00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.130
 so bright or get a new one 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.110
 turn on video thanks and today goes 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 as in the title, it's about next 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 generation bad pc before i go to this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.199
 let's go to talk about the topic 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.150
 first on such a few details 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 from the playstation 4 1 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 as it has betrayed in an interview 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.080
 that battlefield 4 on the playstation 4 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.670
 possibly a mouse and keyboard 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 get support 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 Also, the game will be in 10 80 p 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.380
 full hd and 60 fps running 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 the whole thing is under the motto 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 creating peas experience in the living 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.410
 room 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.719
 that also means that next 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 generation consoles so he said the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 players playing on it with up to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 Play 64 players on a server 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 In addition, there is then still stop 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 two commander and once the spectator 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 or should the spectator mode for 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 Of course , consoles will come again 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.770
 four extra slots for this spectator 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 is anyway why we have up to 70 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.210
 people on a server I myself have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 ever of mouse and keyboard 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 similar input devices for consoles 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.409
 However, these are yes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.030
 apparently not as popular as I can 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.850
 understand quite well why this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 mouse and keyboard spare parts not quite 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 that's how it is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 relatively unfair if one is yourself 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 can turn around really fast and the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 others just with the controller 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.189
 can not turn around too fast 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.950
 But let's assume that the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 playstation 4 this official mouse and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 keyboard support should get 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.930
 that would be almost it already 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 before the next step which cross 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.750
 platform gaming would be called pc bad 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
 or rather with playstation 4 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.189
 of course, there is nothing there 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 cross platform gaming mentioned 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.790
 However, that would be the next for me 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.530
 logical step 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.689
 I do not know how he sees it and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 if that would be necessary at all 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.560
 However, I could quite me 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.149
 Well, especially because that's just the way to go 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.159
 something new would have been I think so 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.129
 I in no other first person 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.200
 shooter seen that's just really pc 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.209
 or console player on 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 to create a server together 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.800
 play and that too 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.630
 even for that would be a cool 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.670
 thing and if battlefield 4 this 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.950
 would make the first step like that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.540
 that would be relative too 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.190
 interesting to see how others are 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.380
 Develop players on it 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.660
 I myself am also superior 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.209
 me a next generation console 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.680
 should pick if I get me one 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.110
 it should probably be one 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 playstation 4 but oh well maybe 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.890
 changes my opinion to that well 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.840
 Anyway, I'm fine with that 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.420
 imagine chilling in the living room and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.459
 battlefield 4 on the playstation 4 with 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.190
 mouse and keyboard to gamble 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.260
 especially the point with 60 fps and 10 80 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.840
 I have loved it since then, too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.820
 I can almost do it for pc games 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.980
 no longer could stand that less 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.140
 as 60 fps have the game 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.910
 that's kind of a thing after all 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.350
 you got so used to it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.750
 it just does not work anymore 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.570
 different from microsofts counterpart to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.760
 not to forget playstation 4 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.070
 The xbox live will also be kinect 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.080
 use what exactly that is supposed to have there 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630
 unfortunately it does not reveal you know 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.730
 but that's definitely not the name 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.440
 that you really run on the spot 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.950
 must be added to somewhere 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.989
 game 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.209
 so much is known but back to 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.030
 cross platform gaming theme what thinks 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.150
 you would like to make such a feature useful 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.430
 if all players have the same input device 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.980
 so in the case keep mouse and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.500
 keyboard or do you think that's easy? 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.150
 for not necessary though I have 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.820
 pc player I am somehow already 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.700
 very curious what it is about this thing 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.769
 with mouse and keyboard on playstation 4 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.140
 I'll decide that way personally 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.600
 but that only works 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.670
 if really server for 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.549
 controller and mouse and keyboard player 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.980
 otherwise you would be separated 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.650
 to create the same scenario 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.530
 as if a pc player was against you 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.730
 console player of the current generation 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.739
 Let's get started and that's somehow 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.299
 not fair that we already had 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.519
 mouse evil controller 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.400
 that's just not a right one 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.380
 heavy combination have first reaction 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.709
 shown that it is also in the community 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.960
 probably no unanimous opinion of the mouse 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.410
 and keyboard theme on playstation 4 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.880
 I give personally 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.490
 I think it's not bad as I said 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.830
 but only if there is really 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.780
 found a decent way 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.940
 this mouse and keyboard shut up 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.390
 support but well now you are on 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.760
 the series 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.160
 what do you think about mouse and keyboard? 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.090
 playstation 4 and kinect on the xbox 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.920
 Bonn 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.390
 I hope you enjoy this video 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.370
 If that's the case here 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.260
 I would be very over one 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.610
 thumb up and if you want 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.530
 that has not done yet and that 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.020
 latest of the latest about battlefield 4 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.760
 want to see or want to see 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.950
 want to subscribe or whatever 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.060
 do not hurt thanks for seeing and 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.060
 hopefully until next time
