00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
let me change the angle of this camera

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.969 
let me change the angle of this camera
so<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> better<00:01:40.290> view<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.890> I'm

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so you can get a better view of what I'm

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
so you can get a better view of what I'm
doing<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.549> we'll<00:01:41.850> jump<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.540> into<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
doing and we'll jump right into it so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
doing and we'll jump right into it so
I'm<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> hugging<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.640> camera<00:01:44.970> right<00:01:45.119> now

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I'm kind of hugging the camera right now

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.449 
you can get the entire logo off with
everything<00:03:14.819> cleanly<00:03:15.480> cut<00:03:15.840> off<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.459> it's

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
everything cleanly cut off of there it's

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.310 
everything cleanly cut off of there it's
challenging<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.570> possible<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.290> just

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
challenging but it is possible so just

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.160 
challenging but it is possible so just
come<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.180> rock<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.299> back<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.480> forth<00:03:21.690> you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
come in and rock it back and forth you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.289 
come in and rock it back and forth you
don't<00:03:22.620> need<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.859> come<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.160> at<00:03:23.280> any<00:03:23.430> hard<00:03:23.910> angles

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
don't need to come in at any hard angles

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.370 
don't need to come in at any hard angles
because<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.600> will<00:03:24.690> cut<00:03:24.900> into<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.140> shell

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
because that will cut into the shell

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.080 
because that will cut into the shell
more<00:03:25.620> than<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.890> need<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.400> eventually

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
more than you need and eventually

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.550 
more than you need and eventually
especially<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.570> these<00:03:27.690> big<00:03:27.989> logos<00:03:28.380> you'll

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
especially on these big logos you'll

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.020 
especially on these big logos you'll
start<00:03:28.829> cutting<00:03:29.130> into<00:03:29.370> multiple<00:03:29.850> areas

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
start cutting into multiple areas

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.430 
start cutting into multiple areas
that'll<00:03:30.390> make<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:30.900> hard<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.200> cut

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
that'll make it really hard to cut

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.110 
that'll make it really hard to cut
that's<00:03:32.069> one<00:03:32.280> reason<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.549> say<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> nice

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
that's one reason I say to have a nice

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.610 
that's one reason I say to have a nice
sharp<00:03:33.150> razor<00:03:33.660> blade<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.989> because<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.380> makes<00:03:34.470> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
sharp razor blade is because it makes it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.039 
sharp razor blade is because it makes it
easier<00:03:35.069> but<00:03:35.340> when<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.239> happens<00:03:36.600> just<00:03:36.720> kind

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
easier but when that happens just kind

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.319 
easier but when that happens just kind
of<00:03:37.109> slice<00:03:37.500> downwards<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.459> will<00:03:38.579> flake<00:03:39.150> off

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of slice downwards and it will flake off

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.940 
of slice downwards and it will flake off
and<00:03:39.359> you<00:03:39.660> can<00:03:39.810> continue<00:03:40.109> but<00:03:40.380> you've<00:03:40.530> noticed

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
and you can continue but you've noticed

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.729 
and you can continue but you've noticed
that<00:03:41.160> I'm<00:03:41.850> cutting<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.209> off<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:43.530> going

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that I'm cutting this off and it's going

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.500 
that I'm cutting this off and it's going
pretty<00:03:43.769> well<00:03:43.980> there's<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.340> couple<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.910> small

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
pretty well there's a couple of small

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.949 
pretty well there's a couple of small
scratches<00:03:46.049> that's<00:03:46.440> because<00:03:46.739> I'm<00:03:46.950> having<00:03:47.519> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
scratches that's because I'm having a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.750 
scratches that's because I'm having a
kind<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.079> difficult<00:03:49.470> time<00:03:49.680> with<00:03:50.489> this

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
kind of a difficult time with this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430 
kind of a difficult time with this
camera<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.389> in<00:03:51.480> front<00:03:51.630> my<00:03:51.750> face<00:03:51.989> usually

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
camera right in front my face usually

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.009 
camera right in front my face usually
I'm<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.950> pretty<00:03:53.370> close<00:03:53.730> making<00:03:54.600> sure<00:03:54.840> that

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
I'm up pretty close making sure that

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.830 
I'm up pretty close making sure that
everything<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.620> smoothly<00:03:56.130> but<00:03:56.840> just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
everything is going smoothly but just

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
everything is going smoothly but just
rock<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.380> back<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.920> forth<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.250> let<00:03:59.850> me<00:03:59.940> get<00:04:00.090> rid

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
rock it back and forth so let me get rid

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:12.610 
rock it back and forth so let me get rid
of<00:04:00.299> all<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.660> stuff<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.139> I'll<00:04:01.319> be<00:04:01.530> right<00:04:01.980> back

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.870 

so<00:04:13.620> once<00:04:13.800> you're<00:04:13.890> done<00:04:13.920> getting<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.340> majority

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
so once you're done getting the majority

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000 
so once you're done getting the majority
of<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.300> plastic<00:04:15.780> off<00:04:15.960> just<00:04:16.320> rub<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.590> finger

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
of the plastic off just rub your finger

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.380 
of the plastic off just rub your finger
over<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.220> area<00:04:17.549> you're<00:04:17.700> gonna<00:04:17.790> feel<00:04:18.120> some

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
over the area you're gonna feel some

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.860 
over the area you're gonna feel some
bumps<00:04:18.840> some<00:04:19.019> lumps<00:04:19.560> all<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.340> stuff<00:04:20.670> from<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
bumps some lumps all that stuff from the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.320 
bumps some lumps all that stuff from the
bits<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.770> logo<00:04:23.310> or<00:04:23.460> text<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:23.760> are<00:04:23.910> still<00:04:24.180> left

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
bits of logo or text that are still left

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.210 
bits of logo or text that are still left
over<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.200> where<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.590> last<00:04:25.860> part<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.160> this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
over this is where the last part of this

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.530 
over this is where the last part of this
process<00:04:26.460> comes<00:04:26.850> in<00:04:26.970> you're<00:04:27.090> gonna<00:04:27.180> take<00:04:27.420> your

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
process comes in you're gonna take your

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.090 
process comes in you're gonna take your
razor<00:04:27.720> blade<00:04:28.050> you're<00:04:28.530> gonna<00:04:28.650> put<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.890> about<00:04:29.070> a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
razor blade you're gonna put it about a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.860 
razor blade you're gonna put it about a
45<00:04:29.700> degree<00:04:29.730> angle<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.450> you're<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.690> gonna

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
45 degree angle and you're just gonna

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.340 
45 degree angle and you're just gonna
scrape<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.720> already<00:04:33.900> see<00:04:34.110> how<00:04:34.230> much

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
scrape you can already see how much

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.700 
scrape you can already see how much
plastic<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:35.100> coming<00:04:35.400> off<00:04:35.550> over<00:04:35.820> here<00:04:36.710> for

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
plastic is coming off over here for

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.470 
plastic is coming off over here for
those<00:04:37.800> tight<00:04:38.070> reach<00:04:38.370> areas<00:04:38.970> like<00:04:39.210> around

those tight reach areas like around

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.020 
those tight reach areas like around
these<00:04:39.930> fake<00:04:40.290> rivets<00:04:41.100> or<00:04:41.220> bolts<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:41.700> whatever

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
these fake rivets or bolts or whatever

these fake rivets or bolts or whatever
they<00:04:42.150> are<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.600> longshot<00:04:43.200> use<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.800> part<00:04:43.980> of

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
they are on the longshot use the part of

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.250 
they are on the longshot use the part of
the<00:04:44.100> blade<00:04:44.250> about<00:04:44.430> 1/3<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.450> towards<00:04:45.900> one

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
the blade about 1/3 of it towards one

the blade about 1/3 of it towards one
side<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.860> kind<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:48.480> keep<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.200> detailed

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
side to kind of just keep that detailed

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.490 
side to kind of just keep that detailed
little<00:04:50.160> area<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.960> just<00:04:51.960> come<00:04:52.200> in<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.380> you'll

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
little area and just come in and you'll

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.170 
little area and just come in and you'll
start<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.800> notice<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.640> logo<00:04:54.030> is

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
start to notice that the logo is

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.060 
start to notice that the logo is
disappearing<00:04:54.810> into<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.320> background<00:04:55.860> and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
disappearing into the background and

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.330 
disappearing into the background and
that's<00:04:56.370> what<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.760> want<00:05:00.530> and<00:05:01.530> eventually<00:05:01.980> you

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
that's what you want and eventually you

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.680 
that's what you want and eventually you
can<00:05:02.520> notice<00:05:02.760> all<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.030> plastic<00:05:03.360> here<00:05:03.480> you'll

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
can notice all the plastic here you'll

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.500 
can notice all the plastic here you'll
end<00:05:03.930> up<00:05:04.080> with<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.710> very<00:05:05.130> smooth<00:05:05.760> surface<00:05:05.790> and

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
end up with a very smooth surface and
