00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
have wide feet so it's for pretty narrow

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.680 
have wide feet so it's for pretty narrow
at<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.920> top<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.549> i<00:03:45.580> would<00:03:45.820> say<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.510> sighs

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.680 
at the top so i would say it going sighs
up<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:48.100> size<00:03:48.370> up<00:03:48.549> for<00:03:48.760> me<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> nine<00:03:49.360> half

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.289 
up and a size up for me is a nine half
for<00:03:49.930> 10<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.680> they<00:03:51.130> didn't<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.580> those<00:03:51.760> so

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
for 10 and they didn't have those so

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.970 
for 10 and they didn't have those so
i'll<00:03:52.690> probably<00:03:53.019> just<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.470> give<00:03:53.769> these<00:03:53.950> away
