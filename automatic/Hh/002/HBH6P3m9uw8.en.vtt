00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.269
 we are still with a disassembled engine e 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.269
 see also an engine 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 now we will see how to disassemble the valve 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.910
 first of all the ktm exhaust system 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.370
 we need a call from six here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 low battery for the one brought 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.670
 first there will be a 6 e key 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 we are going to remove the screws that of the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 lid that hold it and after for 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.020
 side chieti 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:58.949
 now we will be down once I'm ok 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:01.320
 exploited the vines also those that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 keep the muffler does not want to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 muffler we go by for the lid in 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:22.939
 in itself those our most 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 heavy this is a bit 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 settings depends on the oil and caused 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.220
 the percentage 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.579
 here is the seal we go to box 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:47.930
 break result only we have to 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:47.930
 remove this beautiful war cooked 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.700
 ok once opened with milk that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.729
 gasket we present ourselves the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.460
 valve mechanism unloaded from this 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.400
 fork that moves through the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.070
 valve pins 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.270
 these two screws must be removed here and there 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:20.110
 pull the fork guide away 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:27.810
 also the two retainers holding i 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:30.820
 lateral pins after we go to avoid them 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.410
 ok once the screws are removed too 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.590
 lateral 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.680
 let's pull the retaining rings away 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.500
 of the guide found here if 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.500
 pull the valve plate away 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.410
 now all race c touched the tirados i 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.660
 the exhaust valve pins 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:59.530
 ok next procedure is to avoid 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.330
 fast side axles like a clear one from 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.010
 10 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.010
 both parts to extract them 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.610
 any teaching the way to remove 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.310
 the two envelopes 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:20.190
 the two pins here with a bit of effort 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.190
 then they come out of their home 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:01.730
 according to ust now we are going to remove 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.890
 these three pins and then the 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.409
 volvo and exhaust 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.409
 the creative latch on 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:18.049
 ok once we get 2 boosters we go 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:22.000
 to extract also the third axis that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.000
 controls valve movement 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.270
 now the only one we miss for trevi 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:35.539
 to the valve and this upstairs perfect 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.150
 once one to disassemble 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:43.340
 the central axis we are going to screw one 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:47.360
 6 screw I think in the hole of the del 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:51.470
 pin and let's turn it a little bit 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.190
 lives and then with a bit of strength we go to 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.050
 remove the pivot of its seat 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.599
 once this work is done 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:06.260
 simply pull out the valve there 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.919
 will remain in my hand took me down 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.919
 exhaust valve 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.389
 now everything is thoroughly cleaned 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:20.150
 eliminate in the garrison seals yes 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.550
 get fat if you want to refit yes 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.180
 grease everything and put the seal 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.180
 new 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:35.710
 here is the mayor stripping himself in this case 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.710
 we will go will send papal crowe sea mandate 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.060
 when it comes to doing chroma he was cutting off work 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.060
 exhaust must be completely disassembled 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.419
 greetings to all
