00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.440

00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.030

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.030
 backyard and she is half a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.410
 I'll pass is also the foot of the water on the side 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.420
 to not have problem to leak things 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.310
 they say it does not leak but I go 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.429
 spend because it costs cheap 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 I'll pass the brush and so and now I go 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:55.739
