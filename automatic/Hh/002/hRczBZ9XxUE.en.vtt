his shield looks a little small from but
still<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:11.790> solid<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:13.680> his<00:01:14.100> weapon<00:01:14.780> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
still very solid and then his weapon is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
still very solid and then his weapon is
that<00:01:15.960> acts<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.500> spear<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.700> comes<00:01:18.060> with

uh launching that it's like a rubbery
ball<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.750> basketball

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
ball and then it's basketball

so<00:01:30.100> that's<00:01:31.030> his<00:01:31.360> face<00:01:31.570> thought<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.590> mask<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so that's his face thought the mask and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.870 
so that's his face thought the mask and

all<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.480> then<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:43.050> I'll<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.560> flip

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
all right and then just I'll just flip

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.060 
all right and then just I'll just flip
the<00:01:44.130> figure<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.010> he

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the figure on the back so that's what he

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.750 
the figure on the back so that's what he
looks<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
looks like

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.690 
looks like
anyway<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:49.080> Bionicles<00:01:49.980> you<00:01:50.340> actually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
anyway so these Bionicles you actually

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.400 
anyway so these Bionicles you actually
fight<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.150> them<00:01:51.360> unlike<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> other

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
fight with them unlike all the other

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.930 
fight with them unlike all the other
ones<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.700> basically<00:01:54.170> shoot<00:01:55.700> with<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
ones and you basically shoot with this

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.510 
ones and you basically shoot with this
against<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.780> opponent<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:59.250> every

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
against your opponent and then every

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
against your opponent and then every
time<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> hits<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.510> need<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.870> style<00:02:01.080> counter

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
time it hits you need the style counter

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.910 
time it hits you need the style counter
and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.760> once<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> hits<00:02:03.390> death<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:04.260> after<00:02:04.620> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and then once it hits death so after on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.960 
and then once it hits death so after on
the<00:02:05.100> sixth<00:02:05.430> hit<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> dies<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.950> guess<00:02:08.850> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the sixth hit and it dies or I guess you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.030 
the sixth hit and it dies or I guess you
can<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.210> backwards<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.050> start<00:02:10.260> with<00:02:10.500> five<00:02:10.710> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
can go backwards and start with five and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.880 
can go backwards and start with five and
then<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.490> three<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:13.200> anyways<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.860> was

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
then for three but anyways that was

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
then for three but anyways that was
