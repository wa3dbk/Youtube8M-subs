anyway<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.890> feeding<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.579> we

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
anyway a little feeding on right now we

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
anyway a little feeding on right now we
happened<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.410> met<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.890> we

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
happened to get just this met but we

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.709 
happened to get just this met but we
happen<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.519> map<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> figure<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
happen to get this map so I figure you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.000 
happen to get this map so I figure you
know<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> sniping<00:00:58.320> math<00:00:58.530> might<00:00:58.769> as<00:00:58.890> well

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
know it's a sniping math might as well

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
know it's a sniping math might as well
sleep<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.519> it<00:01:00.949> if<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.730> were<00:01:02.910> playing<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
sleep on it if we were playing as the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.060 
sleep on it if we were playing as the
Solari

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.670 

we<00:01:11.070> were<00:01:11.159> playing<00:01:11.460> others<00:01:11.850> level<00:01:12.149> 60<00:01:12.420> okay

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
we were playing others level 60 okay

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.889 
we were playing others level 60 okay
if<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.040> were<00:01:14.130> playing<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> Solari<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.750> we

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
if we were playing as the Solari then we

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.859 
if we were playing as the Solari then we
would<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.170> able<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.460> our<00:01:17.790> compound<00:01:18.600> bow

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
would be able to use our compound bow

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.760 
would be able to use our compound bow
that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> unlock<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.250> level<00:01:20.490> 58<00:01:21.020> I've<00:01:22.020> used<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that you unlock at level 58 I've used it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
that you unlock at level 58 I've used it
and<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.700> greater

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and it's not it's not that much greater

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.590 
and it's not it's not that much greater
than<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.869> bow<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> draw<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
than like this bow the draw time is a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.950 
than like this bow the draw time is a
little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:31.050> better<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.729> hold<00:01:33.060> time<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
little bit better and the hold time is a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.020 
little bit better and the hold time is a
little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.259> better<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.700> you're<00:01:35.819> using

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
little bit better but when you're using

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
little bit better but when you're using
it<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.080> really<00:01:37.229> notice<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it you don't really notice that much of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.559 
it you don't really notice that much of
a<00:01:38.580> difference<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.149> mean<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.360> still<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
a difference I mean it's still a

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.320 
a difference I mean it's still a
one-shot<00:01:39.990> kill<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.530> fully<00:01:40.800> charged<00:01:41.369> it

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
one-shot kill when it's fully charged it

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.149 
one-shot kill when it's fully charged it
has<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> same<00:01:43.289> upgrades<00:01:43.679> nothing

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
has all the same upgrades nothing

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.540 
has all the same upgrades nothing
special

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550 

yeah<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> decide<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.050> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.289> show<00:01:49.409> up

the<00:02:00.360> frickin<00:02:00.689> zipline<00:02:01.049> thanks<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.939> rope

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.090 
the frickin zipline thanks for that rope
ascender<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> nice

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
so if it was any other map I'd be using

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.890 
so if it was any other map I'd be using
the<00:02:17.470> hitman<00:02:17.890> absolution<00:02:18.180> shotgun<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.630> came

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the hitman absolution shotgun that came

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.000 
the hitman absolution shotgun that came
with<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.430> game<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:23.140> we<00:02:23.650> happen<00:02:23.980> to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
with the game but because we happen to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.140 
with the game but because we happen to
get<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.610> particular<00:02:25.150> map<00:02:26.020> beach<00:02:26.820> then<00:02:27.820> it's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
get this particular map beach then it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.660 
get this particular map beach then it's
definitely<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.630> sniping<00:02:28.990> map<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.710> me<00:02:29.740> I'm<00:02:30.520> not

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
definitely a sniping map for me I'm not

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.570 
definitely a sniping map for me I'm not
really<00:02:30.760> seeing<00:02:31.120> anybody<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.040> I'm<00:02:33.400> gonna
