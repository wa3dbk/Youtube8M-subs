00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi bright latin friends how are you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.890
 here again the anti heroes but that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.660
 are quite well today with this new 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 video in which I bring you another 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.469
 ask the Christians but before 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 enter the question I leave them in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.490
 context so I want them to listen or 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 read the following sentences one of the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.510
 glories of civilization would be the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.760
 have improved the luck of the animals 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 a country a civilization can be judged 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 by the way they treat their 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 animals all the knowledge the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 all questions and answers are 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 found in the dog as they could 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.719
 account for something in common in these phrases 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 and in these great characters is the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.960
 subtle message of empathy kindness 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
 with other animals because yes although to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.879
 Many of them are sorry to admit we are part of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.969
 of the animal kingdom the human being is a 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 animal you me that and everything else are 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 animals and these characters were given 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.600
 account of it and many other people 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.329
 on the planet they have realized and do 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.059
 activism pro animal many good things 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.280
 to be able to save many animals 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.530
 trying to send positive messages 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 so in this case the question comes 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.070
 for Christians 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.229
 reading it and reading all the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 works that made me Christ Christ 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 the question arises why christ does not 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.200
 He spoke kindly of the other animals 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.479
 because Christ did not make a sign in this type 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.130
 of empathy with other living beings without 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.190
 However, we can read in the new 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.770
 testament things like you are some 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.170
 vipers to the gentiles who humbled themselves 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 to ask for a miracle he called them 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.180
 dogs referred contemptuously to the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.820
 people who asked for things like dogs and not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 let's forget that peculiar case of exorcism 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.910
 that he carried out and that he took out the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 demons of a person and sent them 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.660
 literally according to the bible to the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.429
 pigs which ended 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.070
 going crazy for the demons and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.259
 drowning like this is the god's son and everything 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 can you then why not just 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.170
 drove the demons to another part to a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.420
 let's say multi parallel universe what do I know 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.690
 me to a black hole already of perdis 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.970
 because to the poor pigs why did 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.000
 that however many many people 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.220
 cling to him 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Christian biology thinking that is all 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.300
 love if you have positive details do not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.090
 I'm going to deny and I want this to be 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.250
 clear though thinking about it well and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.320
 doing a critical thinking on base 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.960
 to what we currently know with a 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.820
 empathy with the animals I do not see him 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.980
 coherence although it should be noted that 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 many people who participate with the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.240
 rescue animals are christian and they are 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 religious or have another tendency 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.770
 religious and this is to applaud and there's 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.570
 that praise him and you have to give him a little hand 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.220
 up to all those activities that 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.200
 do to help the animals I 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.270
 has been and has helped many 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.920
 people and I have seen many cases 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.140
 which the religious really 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.600
 they have love of animals and this 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.000
 will always be applauded however the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.459
 Christian prophet did not mention anything and 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.800
 he simply did not behave at the height of 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.660
 his followers exactly these 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 followers who do a great job but 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.150
 let's remember we place a context 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.160
 let's separate the Lutheran reform and let 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.230
 to Protestant Christians that such 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.060
 once they do not have this type of education, 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.459
 is the kind of culture or rather 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.460
 tradition let's talk about Catholics and 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.370
 his cumshots 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.070
 that so much salty where a possible 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.100
 brave character faces a bull 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.720
 and this they see culturally well and if 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.060
 they see the background of everything has a 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.920
 religious question in this case I have 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.650
 studied some things and I've given 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.890
 account that has symbolisms between that 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.070
 is the devil the bull and the brave is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.300
 some kind of Christ leading between the 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.100
 good and evil 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.730
 something like that we are critical with us 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.500
 same if the question is on the air 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.360
 Christians have really read your bible 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.180
 have really read the context in which 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.790
 Christ spoke about the animals ok 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.730
 I know that they will come with the testimonies of 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.680
 the gospels to audiences where he speaks 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.360
 about what is some horse I speak well of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.340
 the dogs and all these things without 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.530
 However, in the context that 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 they sell as is the bible in the new 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.640
 testament does not say anything at all 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 so please think whether you really 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.020
 they know the christ who has sold them 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.690
 with the bible and well I hope that you 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.330
 have liked the video share it if 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.950
 have any comments leave it and 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.510
 I also recommend the videos that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.810
 are in the description and the video that 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.090
 is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.040
 and also in the link I hope you help them 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.680
 to make a dialectic about what 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.990
 can be done with these animals and a 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.669
 different thinking more empathetic with 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.870
 the species that are at our 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.120
 around 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.760
 being coherent and not wearing either 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.090
 to fanaticism for the love that one can 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.040
 have another species ending up being 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.410
 very misanthrope with our own 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.790
 kind so see you in the next 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.790
 antihero video chao
