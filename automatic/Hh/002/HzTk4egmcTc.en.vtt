00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
probably like to think so I think if you

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.730 
probably like to think so I think if you
offered<00:00:15.030> them<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> comfortable<00:00:15.870> finish<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
offered them a comfortable finish and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490 
offered them a comfortable finish and
some<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.340> exciting<00:00:17.760> days<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:19.170> Knights

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
some very exciting days out as Knights

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.929 
some very exciting days out as Knights
had<00:00:19.619> last<00:00:19.830> season<00:00:20.010> they<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.490> surely<00:00:20.760> take

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
had last season they would surely take

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.070 
had last season they would surely take
it<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.050> think<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.730> trouble<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.420> south

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it I think that the trouble that south

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.720 
it I think that the trouble that south
acton<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> look<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.310> their<00:00:26.430> fixture

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
acton have is a look at their fixture

acton have is a look at their fixture
list<00:00:26.910> tells<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.710> start<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.250> pretty

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
list tells you that the start is pretty

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.830 
list tells you that the start is pretty
horrendous<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> nice

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
horrendous and they got a nice

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
horrendous and they got a nice
comfortable<00:00:31.230> opener<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.830> Manchester<00:00:32.219> City

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
comfortable opener at Manchester City

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639 
comfortable opener at Manchester City
and<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:33.059> within<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:33.960> four<00:00:34.410> games

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and then within their first four games

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.310 
and then within their first four games
they<00:00:34.800> also<00:00:35.010> play<00:00:35.340> man<00:00:35.520> united<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> arsenal

they also play man united and arsenal

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.420 
they also play man united and arsenal
the<00:00:37.320> danger<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.309> might

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the danger for them is that they might

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.740 
the danger for them is that they might
find<00:00:38.700> themselves<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> similar<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
find themselves in a similar kind of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.299 
find themselves in a similar kind of
difficulty<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.350> Bolton<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:40.829> last<00:00:41.070> season

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
they had a horrendous opening set of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
they had a horrendous opening set of
fixtures<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.329> never

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
fixtures as well and you know they never

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.970 
fixtures as well and you know they never
really<00:00:45.780> recovered<00:00:46.350> even<00:00:46.680> though<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.829> made<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
really recovered even though they made a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
really recovered even though they made a
good<00:00:47.070> visit<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.600> fighting<00:00:48.600> their<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
good visit of fighting their way out of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.720 
good visit of fighting their way out of
it<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.219> difficult<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.610> play

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it it's very very difficult to play

it it's very very difficult to play
catch-up<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.600> hard<00:00:51.809> enough<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.020> Bolton<00:00:52.440> who

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559

something on the board fairly early on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
something on the board fairly early on
which<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> tough<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:23.970> them<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
which is going to be tough for them but

that's got to be the ambition and it's

that's got to be the ambition and it's
going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> give<00:01:26.610> them<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.820> enormous<00:01:27.479> head

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

going to give them an enormous head
start<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.790> was

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
start if they can do that it was

start if they can do that it was

through<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.860> journey<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
through this journey some of them you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.460 
through this journey some of them you
know<00:01:42.270> players<00:01:42.780> who've<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.049> been<00:01:43.140> playing<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
know players who've just been playing in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.870 
know players who've just been playing in
the<00:01:43.530> championship<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the championship do you think that you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
the championship do you think that you
expected<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.720> terms<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> transfer

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
expected more in terms of transfer

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
expected more in terms of transfer
business<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.159> need<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
business do you think that they need to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.249 
business do you think that they need to
do<00:01:48.060> more<00:01:48.240> stuff<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> terms<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.930> transfer

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
do more stuff in terms of transfer

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
do more stuff in terms of transfer
business<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.159> possible<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.700> they

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
business I think it's possible that they

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760 
business I think it's possible that they
will<00:01:51.030> bring<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:52.079> or<00:01:52.170> three<00:01:52.229> more<00:01:52.530> players

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
will bring in two or three more players

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
will bring in two or three more players
in<00:01:53.369> key<00:01:53.610> positions<00:01:53.729> before<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.600> end<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
in key positions before the end of the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
in key positions before the end of the
transfer<00:01:55.680> window<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.880> they're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
transfer window I think what they're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
transfer window I think what they're
looking<00:01:57.299> at<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.259> same<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
looking at is in the same way that you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
looking at is in the same way that you
know<00:01:59.100> we've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> examples<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
know we've got a lot of examples now it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
know we've got a lot of examples now it
seems<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.680> not<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> exception<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:02.969> more

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
seems to be not the exception but more

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
seems to be not the exception but more
towards<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> rule<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.380> teams

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
towards the rule that you have teams

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.170 
towards the rule that you have teams
coming<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.729> expect<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
coming up that you would expect to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.429 
coming up that you would expect to
struggle<00:02:06.570> straightaway<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> look<00:02:07.380> at

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
struggle straightaway that you look at

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.359 
struggle straightaway that you look at
the<00:02:07.560> squad<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.069> well<00:02:08.160> there's<00:02:08.310> not

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the squad and you think well there's not

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
the squad and you think well there's not
a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> premier<00:02:08.910> league<00:02:09.000> experience<00:02:09.420> there

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
a lot of premier league experience there

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.630 
a lot of premier league experience there
therefore<00:02:10.709> they're<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> struggle<00:02:11.790> but

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
therefore they're going to struggle but

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.550 
therefore they're going to struggle but
you<00:02:13.330> know<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.690> only<00:02:13.840> need<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.170> look<00:02:14.200> at<00:02:14.410> last

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
you know you only need to look at last

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.949 
you know you only need to look at last
season<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:15.190> see<00:02:15.430> how<00:02:15.730> these<00:02:16.330> teams<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.780> are

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
season to see how these teams that are

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.650 
season to see how these teams that are
coming<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.380> now<00:02:17.650> are<00:02:17.950> feeling<00:02:18.910> confident<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
coming up now are feeling confident that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.090 
coming up now are feeling confident that
they<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.810> make<00:02:20.290> an<00:02:20.410> impression<00:02:20.680> straight

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
they can make an impression straight

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.590 
they can make an impression straight
away<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.520> Premier<00:02:21.819> League<00:02:21.850> even<00:02:22.420> if<00:02:22.510> they

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
away on the Premier League even if they

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.090 
away on the Premier League even if they
don't<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:23.200> around<00:02:23.350> inside<00:02:23.680> their<00:02:23.980> own

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
don't look around inside their own

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.070 
don't look around inside their own
dressing<00:02:24.459> room<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.910> see<00:02:25.240> I've<00:02:25.540> been

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
dressing room and and see I've been

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.540 
dressing room and and see I've been
there<00:02:26.260> done<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.709> all<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.190> over<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
there done that all in all over the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.850 
there done that all in all over the
place<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> think<00:02:29.260> South<00:02:29.440> ampton<00:02:29.709> have

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
place and what I think South ampton have

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.140 
place and what I think South ampton have
is<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> great<00:02:30.310> group<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.640> players<00:02:30.850> who<00:02:31.060> have

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
is a great group of players who have

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.120 
is a great group of players who have
felt<00:02:31.900> success<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:33.630> Adkins<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:36.010> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
felt success and Adkins is going to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.680 
felt success and Adkins is going to
still<00:02:36.340> try<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.580> play<00:02:36.850> an<00:02:37.030> attractive<00:02:37.450> style

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
still try and play an attractive style

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
still try and play an attractive style
of<00:02:37.780> football<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.350> team<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.970> know

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
of football with this team but they know

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.120 
of football with this team but they know
their<00:02:40.390> limitations<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:41.680> what

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
their limitations and I think what

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.870 
their limitations and I think what
they're<00:02:42.190> going<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.370> try<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.610> do<00:02:42.760> is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
they're going to try and do is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.150 
they're going to try and do is
compensate<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.750> super<00:02:44.290> fitness<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.890> I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
compensate with super fitness and I

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.710 
compensate with super fitness and I
understand<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> tantrum<00:02:46.239> we're<00:02:46.390> working

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
understand it's a tantrum we're working

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.330 
understand it's a tantrum we're working
extremely<00:02:47.050> hard<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.500> preseason<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.160> make

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
extremely hard and preseason to make

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.479 
extremely hard and preseason to make
sure<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.180> team<00:02:49.450> already<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:51.160> know<00:02:51.190> if

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
sure that the team already you know if

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.890 
sure that the team already you know if
they<00:02:51.940> cut<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.300> against<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> team<00:02:52.870> that

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
they cut up against the team that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.630 
they cut up against the team that
perhaps<00:02:53.170> they<00:02:53.410> can't<00:02:53.650> match<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.220> terms<00:02:54.430> of

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
perhaps they can't match in terms of

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640 
perhaps they can't match in terms of
pure<00:02:55.120> quality<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.140> they're<00:02:56.320> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.530> make

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
pure quality that they're going to make

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.380 
pure quality that they're going to make
sure<00:02:56.800> they<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.100> at<00:02:57.250> least<00:02:57.519> match<00:02:57.820> them<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.300> a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
sure they can at least match them in a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.900 
sure they can at least match them in a
similar<00:02:58.720> way<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.989> Norwich<00:02:59.530> did<00:02:59.800> for<00:03:00.430> sheer

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
similar way that Norwich did for sheer

similar way that Norwich did for sheer

into into a player who's very capable at
the<00:03:45.220> highest<00:03:45.430> stage<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.060> there's<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> French

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the highest stage and there's a French

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.650 
the highest stage and there's a French
on<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.049> 21<00:03:47.470> player<00:03:47.769> Morgan<00:03:48.250> Schneiderlin<00:03:48.700> who

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
on a 21 player Morgan Schneiderlin who

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.470 
on a 21 player Morgan Schneiderlin who
by<00:03:50.590> all<00:03:50.620> accounts<00:03:50.769> is<00:03:51.310> someone<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:51.850> can

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
by all accounts is someone that can

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.479 
by all accounts is someone that can
develop<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.440> perhaps<00:03:53.860> even<00:03:54.130> pushing

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
develop to be perhaps even pushing

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.400 
develop to be perhaps even pushing
forward<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.049> challenge<00:03:56.049> for<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.200> French

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
forward to challenge for the French

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.350 
forward to challenge for the French
national<00:03:56.620> team<00:03:56.890> that's<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.400> how<00:03:57.820> highly<00:03:58.060> some

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
national team that's so how highly some

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.789 
national team that's so how highly some
people<00:03:58.600> think<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.840> him<00:03:58.900> down<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.290> Southampton

people think of him down in Southampton

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.560 
people think of him down in Southampton
so<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.280> think<00:04:00.700> they<00:04:00.850> feel<00:04:01.030> they've<00:04:01.239> got<00:04:01.390> some

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
so I think they feel they've got some

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.910 
so I think they feel they've got some
talent<00:04:01.900> now<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.170> it's<00:04:02.260> whether<00:04:02.470> or<00:04:02.620> not<00:04:02.739> that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
talent now and it's whether or not that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.580 
talent now and it's whether or not that
talent<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.400> able<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.269> express<00:04:04.570> itself<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.230> this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
talent is able to express itself on this

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.860 
talent is able to express itself on this
stage
