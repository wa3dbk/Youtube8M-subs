00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 and to try with you is a blessing 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.589
 because you know that I have been doing 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.900
 this missionary work of my mission is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 save marriages and help the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.269
 young people to prepare for love now 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.269
 let's talk 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.630
 certainly yes 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.630
 clear everywhere 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.950
 you believe that women do not lie if 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.860
 women also lie but in the 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.630
 relationship the woman is usually more honest 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.760
 because the woman has an intelligence 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.290
 more developed emotional and you know 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 well that the intelligence of men 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.250
 it's the abstract that's why it has a 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 IQ usually 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.710
 also higher that brings them to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.200
 mathematics etc 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.210
 but the woman dominates her emotions and her 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.910
 feelings and as such express 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 better also if I'm abstract 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.920
 and then 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 the man has a compartment 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 special for male friends and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 when he's with male friends that 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.330
 Please do not go out 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 drink but if other things with friends 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.229
 males do not like that the woman is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 interrupting that space that he has 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 separated and then one thing 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 very interesting that when women 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 they discover it is how hallelujah is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.440
 I turned on the bulb because men 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 they are so different they have a 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.680
 compartment that is the vacuum of 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.460
 nothing and that's why when a woman when 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460
 to you 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.119
 ah 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 I can not be now without thinking about 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 nothing then was something you have to be 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.100
 thinking 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.080
 for that reason when the woman sees that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.940
 face of her husband who is but that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.979
 it seems that it is there is not she comes 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.440
 question but what's up there is something wrong 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.300
 something happens to you but tell me I propose a party 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 speak please you're thinking that 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.070
 is missing and he says in nothing I'm 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.560
 Thinking about nothing is impossible one 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.270
 can think and nothing is not impossible 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 you are lying and it is that the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.400
 compartment of that empty man is in 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.770
 the moment in which the man wants 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.450
 be alone we agree that there is man 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.450
 that has a void all 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.840
 and then my advice to the ladies is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.510
 that when man wants to be alone 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.690
 in your space and do not get into that cave 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.790
 to try to get him out of his cave try 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 respond in an intelligent way 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.680
 ok my love when you want to talk when 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.610
 you want to see me when they need me 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.610
 we know why in my head 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.709
 and this is why the big ones start 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 conflicts and the big problems of 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.030
 isolation in couples because 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.760
 we are different God created us 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.829
 different and we should not only respect 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.450
 but applaud the differences but the 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.640
 relationship would be very boring 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.250
 look really nobody can understand 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 a woman as well as another woman but 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.420
 we because we know that you do not 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.730
 they can understand us we are satisfied 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.840
 because they love us so at least without 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.470
 understand very well 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.569
 yes yes yes the romance what a shame because 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.910
 there were times in the history of 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.940
 humanity where men perpetuated 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.650
 romance throughout the marriage and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.099
 that's why in those generations 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.080
 marriages if they lasted today of 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:44.060
 every two one as a therapist or as that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.090
 you are in your task to help the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 couples what is the complaint plus the common 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.900
 denominator of the complaint of men 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.150
 of the same thing that men complain about 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.030
 there is terrific they complain that the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.079
 women are not good enough 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.299
 in the bed 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.920
 they want lovers when they get married 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.450
 you my dear little daughters that I 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.120
 they are seeing the ones that are not married 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.220
 still when they get married remember that your 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.959
 husband needs them as lovers and 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.830
 Fiery lovers because that's what the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.950
 marriage to consecrate 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.410
 the sexual relationship because it is allowed 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.360
 within marriage as a design 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.940
 divine so I have nothing wrong with the 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.920
 sex in marriage and what is and what is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.450
 is the complaint of women by 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.640
 excellence those that first have the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.350
 This is the one that I always deal with 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.200
 respect to women that her husband does not 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.770
 Tell him not to speak good you 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.770
 they are also the exception 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.750
 I do not usually talk much and when really 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.790
 one is under pressure the man tends to 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
 to be silenced while the woman I think 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.620
 he wants to speak the act, look gentlemen 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.020
 I'm going to give you a secret after 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.770
 so many years of study of psychology 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.860
 feminine for the woman the second pleasure 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.270
 greatest is the oral communication the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.210
 first is the orgasm obviously but 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.210
 second chocolate communication 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.610
 because the woman at the time that she 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.159
 communicated orally and does it very well 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.139
 very fluently and with a lot of passion and 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.460
 she is feeling an explosion of 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.509
 hormones related hormones 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.729
 when you speak when exact and then 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.710
 from the hormonal point of view in that 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.500
 moment the woman enters a sensation 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.900
 of euphoria that same conversation 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.580
 it produces from there that for when you 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.770
 they go for example a ladies hairdresser 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 and come to all the ladies that are finished 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.159
 to know talking about climbing miracles 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.669
 that they confess to the most things 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.909
 intimate 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:46.280
 one says wow but because women 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:53.120
 thrown in the hairdresser is short as 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.909
 I do not want to talk looking for someone with 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.159
 who speaks I bring to cut my hair 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:06:00.020
 how the one who thinks goes loves him 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.790
 hartito 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.710
 ah 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.270
 instead women speak up for 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.100
 the elbows but now you can understand 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.570
 why because it 's our second that you 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.110
 you're the exception I do not see you that way 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.110
 chatty 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.330
 LOL
