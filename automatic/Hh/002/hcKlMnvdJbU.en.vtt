00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
right so let's talk first about that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620 
right so let's talk first about that
thermostat<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:20.820> there's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.449> lot

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
thermostat because I think there's a lot

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.990 
thermostat because I think there's a lot
of<00:00:21.720> confusion<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:22.439> setting<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> thermos<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
of confusion about setting the thermos I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640 
of confusion about setting the thermos I
think<00:00:24.300> most<00:00:24.449> people<00:00:24.689> believe<00:00:24.720> look<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.410> just

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
think most people believe look I just

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
think most people believe look I just
set<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.830> thermostat<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.490> 78<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> never<00:00:27.330> touch<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
set my thermostat at 78 I never touch it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
set my thermostat at 78 I never touch it
and<00:00:27.990> that's<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> save<00:00:28.949> me<00:00:29.099> money<00:00:29.279> but

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
and that's going to save me money but

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
and that's going to save me money but
not<00:00:29.880> true<00:00:30.210> right<00:00:30.449> oh<00:00:30.599> absolutely<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.590> no<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
not true right oh absolutely not no you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.610 
not true right oh absolutely not no you
there's<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.090> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:34.050> good<00:00:34.380> at

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there's you want to get very good at

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.500 
there's you want to get very good at
understanding<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:35.489> own<00:00:35.520> habits<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
understanding your own habits and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.380 
understanding your own habits and
matching<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> thermostat<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> match<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
matching the thermostat to match that

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.619 
matching the thermostat to match that
because<00:00:39.390> every<00:00:40.350> degree<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.730> change<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
because every degree that you change it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.139 
because every degree that you change it
below<00:00:42.870> 78<00:00:43.379> degrees<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:44.160> influence<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
below 78 degrees can influence can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.569 
below 78 degrees can influence can
adjust<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.690> overall<00:00:46.530> bill<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:46.890> six<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> eight

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to be away from the home for example we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
to be away from the home for example we
talked<00:00:52.050> about<00:00:52.170> programming<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> thermostats

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
talked about programming and thermostats

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.979 
talked about programming and thermostats
and<00:00:53.730> seeing<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.539> away<00:00:54.660> with

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and seeing if you can get away with

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
and seeing if you can get away with
adjusting<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> degree<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.280> two<00:00:56.430> higher<00:00:56.460> right

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
adjusting a degree or two higher right

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
adjusting a degree or two higher right
when<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.690> away<00:00:57.960> from<00:00:58.020> home<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.620> need<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
when you're away from home you need to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
when you're away from home you need to
just<00:00:59.280> turn<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> bad<00:00:59.760> boy<00:00:59.940> off<00:01:00.149> turn<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.780> 85

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
just turn that bad boy off turn it to 85

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.260 
just turn that bad boy off turn it to 85
and<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> leave<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> house<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.059> more

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and when you leave the house for more

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.810 
and when you leave the house for more
than<00:01:03.329> four<00:01:03.750> hours<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.650> reason<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
than four hours the reason why is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.950 
than four hours the reason why is
because<00:01:06.030> air<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.869> not

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
because air is so it's it's it's not

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
because air is so it's it's it's not
dense<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:11.070> change<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
dense and so you can change the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
dense and so you can change the
temperature<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.850> air<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.270> quickly<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.960> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
temperature of air very quickly and so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 
temperature of air very quickly and so
ideally<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.509> turn

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ideally what you want to do is just turn

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.880 
ideally what you want to do is just turn
it<00:01:15.869> off<00:01:15.990> during<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> day<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.619> you're<00:01:16.710> gone

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it off during the day when you're gone

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
it off during the day when you're gone
you<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.790> set<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.810> come

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you know set it so that when you come

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.450 
you know set it so that when you come
home<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.470> five<00:01:19.619> o'clock<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> start

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
home at five o'clock it's going to start

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
home at five o'clock it's going to start
cooling<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> house<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:21.990> 5:30

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
cooling down the house so that at 5:30

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
cooling down the house so that at 5:30
when<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> come<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.220> should<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.490> nice<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's more economical to do it it's
complete<00:01:31.560> myth<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.079> because<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
complete myth and so because what is

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
complete myth and so because what is
happening<00:01:34.500> throughout<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> day<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.909> you're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
happening throughout the day is you're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.350 
happening throughout the day is you're
constantly<00:01:36.720> removing<00:01:37.200> house<00:01:37.890> full<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.850> air

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
constantly removing house full of air

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.230 
constantly removing house full of air
conditioning<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.030> bigger

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
conditioning because the the the bigger

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
conditioning because the the the bigger
the<00:01:42.420> difference<00:01:42.570> between<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> inside<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the difference between the inside and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
the difference between the inside and
the<00:01:44.100> outside<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.479> home

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the outside of your home

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.460 
the outside of your home
temperature-wise

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
temperature-wise

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
temperature-wise
air<00:01:47.100> conditioning<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.610> has<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> work<00:01:48.119> much

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
air conditioning just has to work much

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990 
air conditioning just has to work much
harder<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.229> maintain<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:50.220> difference<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
harder to maintain that difference and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
harder to maintain that difference and
so<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> difference<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.930> smaller<00:01:52.229> Daisy

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so as the difference is smaller Daisy

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.170 
so as the difference is smaller Daisy
doesn't<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> work<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.640> hard<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:54.000> right

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
doesn't have to work as hard all right

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.249 
doesn't have to work as hard all right
that<00:01:54.329> makes<00:01:54.509> sense<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that makes sense all right let's get to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.980 
that makes sense all right let's get to
number<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:55.860> ceiling<00:01:56.460> fans<00:01:56.729> yes<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
number two use your ceiling fans yes a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
number two use your ceiling fans yes a
ceiling<00:01:58.649> fan<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.250> make<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.850> temperature

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ceiling fan can make the temperature

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.560 
ceiling fan can make the temperature
feel<00:02:00.540> six<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> eight<00:02:01.409> degrees<00:02:01.979> cooler<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
feel six to eight degrees cooler in the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.630 
feel six to eight degrees cooler in the
room<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> doesn't<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.560> change<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
room now it doesn't actually change the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
room now it doesn't actually change the
temperature<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> leave<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> room

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
temperature so when you leave a room

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.199 
temperature so when you leave a room
there's<00:02:07.799> no<00:02:08.129> sense<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> keeping<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> fan

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
there's no sense in keeping the fan

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.699 
there's no sense in keeping the fan
going<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.080> here's<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> thing<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.679> a

if the ceiling fan take a look at how
it's<00:02:13.709> blowing<00:02:14.099> if<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.879> sucking<00:02:15.359> the
