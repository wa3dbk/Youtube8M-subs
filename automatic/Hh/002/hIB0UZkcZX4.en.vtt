00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.660
 the spirits are real 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.630
 That was the marketing slogan of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.139
 activision for basket the goz but looks 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.790
 take a look at u is made of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.240
 by heart from the rubbish bin 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.820
 areas of the Kemper is already there where 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.980
 he still belongs in others 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.289
 camper wanted or something to eat 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.930
 but what this young who has withdrawn 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.150
 Im immediately widow have seen that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.770
 was too much for my nerves 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.969
 yes sounds at the start here on octane foul 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.500
 one of the few who went well 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.129
 are with me lately I give 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 be honest 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.600
 the free for all is fighting fought 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.350
 Fought like hell he would fit 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.410
 fought like hell 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.390
 no pig moves but it does 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.039
 is no longer on the spot so it is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.719
 also in every other game mode 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.460
 even kill what he actually kills 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.510
 a fast game mode is there 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.399
 like to sit 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 yes and if you play other game modes 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.479
 like nomination or lightning or something 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.340
 is then sat even more 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.979
 that means virtually all are only 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 Sit and fight in this game 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.530
 it's so overly blatant you can 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 hardly move properly when you are 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.380
 any fixed position therefore has 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.799
 like I have you now one on one 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.299
 Huge advantage anyway so always that 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.210
 webdesign of the game leads of course 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.520
 to that people also like in 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.240
 windows sit for example my 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.549
 Favorite seats are sniper at that time 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.560
 little bitches the mmb 21 me everything 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.030
 already the last time her appearance 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.159
 had been in the call of duty saw ever since 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.659
 There was unity thermal sniper 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.780
 suddenly again in full effect again 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.729
 off sitting on her idea he this 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.640
 Kemper tool of the very finest 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.670
 then put it up there somewhere 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.329
 eamon three minutes to a spot and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.219
 then you will go and what no chance 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.630
 I could puke all this 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.340
 slide retire partially so 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.420
 would have played my game on tor 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.189
 but I still find the map 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.219
 actually quite good because you as a woman 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.750
 the map but I play with slide man 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.020
 the kill confirmed after nine minutes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.590
 stood 24 to 33 this leipa were exactly 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 they only have two spots to find 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.319
 I weigh a millimeter and come 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.050
 not right that immediately dead 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.940
 the more beautiful with sleeves and no 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.680
 Anyway, you can now do that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.599
 ask why could people in 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430
 so blatantly more on mp3 black ops 2 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.989
 not as cam camp as in this game 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.459
 sometimes there is nothing going on at all 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.510
 In this game I want us 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.030
 only one of them has moved 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.620
 partly have with you thicker and together 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 of course looks at the different 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 art first with the soundbox yes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.890
 So I have dead silence and even one 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.840
 Amplified guy can hear me a pizza 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.440
 not quite as good as without but he can 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.299
 hear me 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 that means he practically sits in the corner 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.120
 and can hear me yes this shit 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.069
 little idea destroys that too 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.260
 So or this motion sensor yes that yes 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.310
 worse than anything I am there 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 yes then practically through the wall 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.410
 visible 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.610
 who has the shit already 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.799
 again booked this whole kemper 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.870
 tools If this idea is like a 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.220
 claymore to stick more 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.269
 Who came up with the shit ? 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.560
 I was glad they did not stick 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.019
 there is more, then they do it again 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.220
 pure so anyway the soundbox are 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 blame the people have totally 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.890
 guarded now, yes, if you zhong 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.940
 known and moved to Becker place so 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.639
 I use mp3 and sit in the corner 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.260
 or listen to why why bmw 1 had the 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.760
 time into no reason because no pig has 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.000
 complains about being present 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.829
 So last day what could that be 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.139
 Do it again like call of duty 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.900
 4 mw 1 there it was perfect no one has 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.639
 it gets excited that it's only that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 second of course is the problem with 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.819
 falling fast now is natural 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.440
 The question is probably nothing 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.470
 I've already said a video 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.359
 why do you fall so fast the stats the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.650
 weapons do not set like mw3 the 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.250
 Weapons do not hurt anymore 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.519
 as previously 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.069
 yes you can say okay the the 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.389
 connections better or the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.190
 but the hit market came the passengers 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.569
 you lie because that's actually it 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.040
 Maybe it was just a lie 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.599
 fall within 0.1 seconds if 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.340
 I look at the kill cam every time 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.810
 the opponent has two seconds ahead 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.549
 sees this too has been a long time 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.859
 whole magazine 1 celebrated but in my 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.970
 church sure only how fall instantly 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.720
 looks like this has developed into a 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.340
 shot dead 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.630
 yes, that's already the case with cats 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.489
 you have seen these falls I have after 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.659
 loaded because I thought that was me 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.690
 I did a burst that 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:28.610
 usually enough yes and then 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.290
 the water with the kemtrack anyway 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.520
 you just drop so fast and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.860
 probably is entirely compensation 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.090
 you do not know because the kids server 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.460
 There's not that we have such a great one 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.840
 the action of infinity was the but 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.130
 In the end, you still have to say that too 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.080
 when these two things are about to start 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.760
 could still move so anyway 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.640
 It is not just that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.190
 players play this call of duty 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.760
 community like the play it is easy 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.400
 only bad 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.230
 they manage every call of duty 2 mw2 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.410
 was one of the best but how far is 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.510
 the funniest call of dutys but there was 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.090
 when to army and all kinds of such 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.220
 shit yes and of course all abuse 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.560
 from the players ups and everything, of course 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.090
 completely again he abuses that is 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.970
 the players are responsible for it 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.800
 that just less and less fun 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.150
 day to day to be honest i know 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.090
 not as you are but that is one 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.880
 camp of duty it is not correct this 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.040
 camp of duty and it just awful 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.250
 like these players all for all so much 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.950
 afraid to move and then will 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.169
 then I read forum is tactical 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.110
 play a tactical game of clear sitting 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.060
 around the top and fight for three minutes 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.820
 one place and max payne 3 minutes 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.290
 long and cool but with this one 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.400
 with this july again like it is now 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.220
 Here's the game one has again 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.130
 Do not fucking damn shit over 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.350
 But then come on the set and do it 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.270
 this sap z comes in front of her nose and 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.400
 are also next to the time 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.650
 around and wait until one comes so 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.510
 please people it should be that one 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.610
 moves you yet again ago 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.580
 we small camper i said im im 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.680
 camper of the week video camp at the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.270
 Of course, there's a lot there, too 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.590
 I simon gladly cut back to me 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.270
 I have but I have already 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.140
 said if everyone would play like this 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.090
 call of duty dead 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.530
 call of duty is dead if all is still dead 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.780
 are camping and no mold 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.860
 moved and at gosch is just about 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.660
 in the direction that people are 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.010
 move and then the player dies 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.260
 is not fun when the people are 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.960
 Do not move that to the topic yet 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.840
 something caught in its own thing on Friday 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.820
 me the ps4 and then live 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.270
 stream with the built-in functions 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.440
 the times test with tv occurs the link 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.150
 you can find it in the description 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.190
 probably kiss and multiplayer too 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.510
 and ghost multiplayer must play 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.550
 Of course, I still hope to download it 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.990
 will go on the day yes because could 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.540
 that the servers are completely overloaded 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.400
 are and the size of the 1 30 gb is 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.220
 then turn on friday probably 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.690
 around noon I suspect so 14.15 clock 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.600
 I took vacation there on work 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.740
 So I think it's about time 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.530
 In any case, I'll start another at first 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.920
 it was my children's stream 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.920
 and
