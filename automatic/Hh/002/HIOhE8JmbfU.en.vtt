entire bottom I'll often take my bone
folder<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.180> go<00:02:16.569> in<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.989> rub<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:18.070> that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
folder just go in and rub it like that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.610 
folder just go in and rub it like that
across<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.730> bottom<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.170> want<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.500> be

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
across the bottom now you want to be

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.200 
across the bottom now you want to be
sure<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:22.060> leave<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.410> end<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:24.550> has<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
sure that you leave the end that has the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.890 
sure that you leave the end that has the
spout<00:02:26.010> without<00:02:27.010> glue<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.660> end<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
spout without glue so this is the end I
