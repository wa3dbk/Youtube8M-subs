24 inches of Brazilian and my first take

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.160 
24 inches of Brazilian and my first take
on<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
on it is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.920 
on it is
I<00:00:52.199> didn't<00:00:53.160> quick<00:00:53.399> weave<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:55.370> sewed<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.399> in

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
I didn't quick weave it in I sewed it in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
I didn't quick weave it in I sewed it in
so<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> shedding<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> lot

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so it was a lot of shedding it was a lot

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
so it was a lot of shedding it was a lot
of<00:01:02.280> sitting<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.300> whole<00:01:03.629> lot<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of sitting like a whole lot of in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
of sitting like a whole lot of in
it<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.189> has<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.030> closure<00:01:06.330> included<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.939> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it it has the closure included and this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.890 
it it has the closure included and this
is<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.810> left<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
is what I have left I think this is the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.469 
is what I have left I think this is the
6<00:01:12.900> inches<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> actually<00:01:15.869> 3<00:01:16.259> track<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
6 inches this is actually 3 track and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
6 inches this is actually 3 track and
this<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> suit<00:01:19.380> inches<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.610> don't

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this is the suit inches and you don't

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.060 
this is the suit inches and you don't
have<00:01:23.939> any<00:01:24.210> 4<00:01:24.450> inches<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:26.119> know<00:01:27.710> maybe<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have any 4 inches I know maybe this is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.609 
have any 4 inches I know maybe this is
before<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
before I don't know I think it is but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.670 
before I don't know I think it is but
you<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.579> says<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:36.380> hope<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.619> don't

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
you see that it just says I hope I don't

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
you see that it just says I hope I don't
have<00:01:37.890> trouble<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> whole<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
have trouble with it the whole time I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
have trouble with it the whole time I
have<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.860> him<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> wouldn't<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
have in him because that wouldn't be

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.770

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
good if I have to deal with shedding but

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
good if I have to deal with shedding but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
at all without a cap I think I don't

at all without a cap I think I don't
know<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> way<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.189> pulls

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

your hair when you sew it on without

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.699 
your hair when you sew it on without
