here's<00:00:16.129> the<00:00:16.340> 3000<00:00:17.210> for<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.480> $3,000<00:00:18.699> skin<00:00:19.699> you

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
here's the 3000 for the $3,000 skin you

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.970 
here's the 3000 for the $3,000 skin you
still<00:00:20.390> have<00:00:20.599> thirty<00:00:21.080> one<00:00:22.509> so<00:00:23.509> we<00:00:24.079> can<00:00:24.230> snag<00:00:24.560> one

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
still have thirty one so we can snag one

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.359 
still have thirty one so we can snag one
more<00:00:25.360> one<00:00:26.360> more<00:00:26.390> would<00:00:26.840> probably<00:00:27.800> put<00:00:28.070> us<00:00:28.189> at

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
more one more would probably put us at

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.370 
more one more would probably put us at
least<00:00:28.550> even<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:29.390> that's<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.930> ultimate<00:00:30.050> goal

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
least even so that's the ultimate goal

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.009 
least even so that's the ultimate goal
here<00:00:30.829> within<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.220> next<00:00:31.400> thirty<00:00:31.699> one<00:00:31.939> spins<00:00:32.300> or

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
here within the next thirty one spins or

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.729 
here within the next thirty one spins or
even<00:00:33.920> if<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.070> can<00:00:34.339> end<00:00:34.519> up<00:00:34.670> with<00:00:35.440> 2/3<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.470> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the number of 77 come on

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.130 
the number of 77 come on
number<00:02:11.830> 78

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.890 

swing<00:02:17.140> number<00:02:17.379> 79

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.589 

it's<00:02:20.900> been<00:02:21.140> number<00:02:21.440> 80

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.500 

there<00:02:25.439> we<00:02:25.530> go<00:02:25.680> there's<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.219> $500<00:02:27.060> spin<00:02:27.329> right

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
there we go there's a $500 spin right

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.190 
there we go there's a $500 spin right
there<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.859> got<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.480> $2,000<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.659> go<00:02:30.840> where

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
there so we got the $2,000 to go where

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.000 
there so we got the $2,000 to go where
it's<00:02:32.120> $6,800<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.439> just<00:02:34.739> need<00:02:34.859> to

it's $6,800 we really do just need to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.949 
it's $6,800 we really do just need to
get<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.340> spin<00:02:35.670> symbol<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.299> time<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
get that spin symbol one time in the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.770 
get that spin symbol one time in the
next<00:02:37.260> 20<00:02:37.650> spins<00:02:38.010> that's<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.090> ultimate<00:02:39.209> goal

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
next 20 spins that's the ultimate goal

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.839 
next 20 spins that's the ultimate goal
here<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.769> we<00:02:40.980> should<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.549> pretty<00:02:41.579> good

shape<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.239> here<00:02:42.629> we<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.139> spin<00:02:43.409> number<00:02:43.590> 81

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.809 

400<00:02:50.220> remember<00:02:51.150> 82

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819

number<00:02:56.750> 83

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.589 

there's<00:03:01.230> 100<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:02.400> been<00:03:02.610> number<00:03:02.910> 84

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.780 

another<00:03:07.599> hundred<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.920> number<00:03:09.220> eighty<00:03:09.430> five

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
another hundred in number eighty five

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.520 
another hundred in number eighty five
hundred<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.300> now<00:03:13.450> we're<00:03:13.660> at<00:03:13.750> seventy<00:03:14.260> two

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
hundred so now we're at seventy two

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.290 
hundred so now we're at seventy two
hundred<00:03:15.040> dollars<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.670> everybody's<00:03:16.090> going<00:03:16.269> to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
spins to go would you really do just

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.530 
spins to go would you really do just
need<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.560> find<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.129> spin<00:03:24.640> symbol<00:03:25.030> one<00:03:25.269> time

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
need to find that spin symbol one time

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.710 
need to find that spin symbol one time
just<00:03:25.930> one<00:03:26.170> time<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.459> should<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.540> the
