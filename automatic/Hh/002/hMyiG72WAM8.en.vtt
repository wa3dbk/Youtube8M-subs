example on this chord which is a C chord
you<00:01:20.600> should<00:01:20.810> only<00:01:20.960> strum<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.859> top<00:01:22.130> five

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
you should only strum the top five

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.510 
you should only strum the top five
strings<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:24.229> numbers<00:01:24.679> by<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.009> fingering

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.010 
when playing a chord for the first time
it<00:01:31.069> is<00:01:31.130> often<00:01:31.549> wise<00:01:31.819> to<00:01:32.149> start<00:01:32.389> on<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.749> first

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it is often wise to start on the first

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.389 
it is often wise to start on the first
finger<00:01:33.289> then<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.429> second<00:01:34.909> etc<00:01:36.189> well<00:01:37.189> this

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
finger then the second etc well this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.489 
finger then the second etc well this
chord<00:01:37.729> then<00:01:37.969> you<00:01:38.359> should<00:01:38.569> have<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.170> first

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
chord then you should have the first

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.330 
chord then you should have the first
finger<00:01:39.799> on<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.189> first<00:01:40.670> fret<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.569> B<00:01:42.020> string

third fret of the a string
you<00:01:51.979> should<00:01:52.219> then<00:01:52.369> strum<00:01:52.850> five<00:01:53.539> strings

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
you should then strum five strings

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.539 
you should then strum five strings
ignoring<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.490> bottom<00:01:55.819> E<00:01:55.939> string<00:01:56.679> at<00:01:57.679> this

ignoring the bottom E string at this

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.190 
ignoring the bottom E string at this
stage<00:01:58.819> is<00:01:59.119> worth<00:01:59.450> pointing<00:01:59.899> out<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
stage is worth pointing out the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.499 
stage is worth pointing out the
similarity<00:02:00.889> between<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.399> chord<00:02:01.729> map<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.149> a
