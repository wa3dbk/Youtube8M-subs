trying to ask is can you put on muscle
it<00:00:44.340> kind<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> goes<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.450> yes<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.350> can

you put on muscle and burn fat at the
same<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> answer<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.010> yes<00:00:50.250> it's

quality<00:01:10.740> lean<00:01:11.250> muscle<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.200> how

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
quality lean muscle I don't know how

that<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.979> ended<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.490> happening<00:01:14.729> where<00:01:15.600> people

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that all ended up happening where people

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.999 
that all ended up happening where people
got<00:01:16.259> bulky<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.430> big<00:01:17.670> offseason

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
got bulky and have this big offseason

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
got bulky and have this big offseason
probably<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.220> bodybuilders<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
probably for bodybuilders but that you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
probably for bodybuilders but that you
know<00:01:22.229> works<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.460> there's<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.759> much

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
know works because there's so much

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520 
know works because there's so much
bigger<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.470> much

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bigger and they have to put on so much

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
bigger and they have to put on so much
more<00:01:25.890> size<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> eat<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.720> much

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
more size and they have to eat so much

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
more size and they have to eat so much
more<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.210> ladies<00:01:30.210> we<00:01:30.479> certainly

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more than we do but ladies we certainly

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
more than we do but ladies we certainly
don't<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.920> only<00:01:32.430> thing<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
don't have to the only thing you need to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
don't have to the only thing you need to
put<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.869> muscle<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> calorie<00:01:35.369> surplus<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
put on muscle is a calorie surplus so

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
put on muscle is a calorie surplus so
with<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:39.060> come<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> tiny<00:01:39.570> bit<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> body

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
with that will come a tiny bit of body

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.359 
with that will come a tiny bit of body
fat<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:40.799> eating<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.159> than

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
fat just because you're eating more than

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
fat just because you're eating more than
your<00:01:41.850> body<00:01:42.000> needs<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.540> maintenance<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.140> for

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
cutting but it does not have to be a lot

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
cutting but it does not have to be a lot
you<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.170> need<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> slight<00:01:46.920> energy<00:01:47.509> calorie

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you just need a slight energy calorie

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.149 
you just need a slight energy calorie
surplus<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> able<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> support<00:01:51.119> putting<00:01:51.780> on

surplus to be able to support putting on
lean<00:01:53.159> muscle<00:01:53.189> mass<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.549> ton<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
lean muscle mass you don't need a ton of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.679 
lean muscle mass you don't need a ton of
extra<00:02:00.060> calories<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.740> find<00:02:02.219> a

extra calories you just have to find a

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.840 
extra calories you just have to find a
nutrient<00:02:03.689> cycling<00:02:04.140> setup<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.520> kind<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
nutrient cycling setup that's kind of

20<00:04:44.660> weeks<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.140> probably<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.620> minimum<00:04:46.040> in<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.420> my

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
20 weeks is probably a minimum in in my

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.540 
20 weeks is probably a minimum in in my
opinion<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.350> get<00:04:48.500> ready<00:04:48.680> for<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:48.920> contest<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
opinion to get ready for a contest and

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.350 
opinion to get ready for a contest and
that's<00:04:49.730> if<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.180> don't<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:52.130> ton<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:53.060> ton<00:04:53.120> of

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
that's if you don't have a ton a ton of

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.360 
that's if you don't have a ton a ton of
fat<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.810> lose<00:04:53.990> or<00:04:54.260> if<00:04:54.530> you've<00:04:54.710> done<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.130> show

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
fat to lose or if you've done a show

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.350 
fat to lose or if you've done a show
before<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:58.130> want<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.520> give<00:04:59.030> yourself

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
before you just want to give yourself

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.120 
before you just want to give yourself
enough<00:04:59.570> time<00:04:59.780> for<00:05:00.170> trying<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.100> making

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
enough time for trying and making

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.280 
enough time for trying and making
mistakes<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.450> learning<00:05:03.110> your<00:05:03.410> body<00:05:03.880> okay<00:05:04.880> so

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
mistakes and learning your body okay so

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.670 
mistakes and learning your body okay so
next<00:05:06.290> question<00:05:06.700> is<00:05:07.930> what<00:05:08.930> kind<00:05:09.170> of<00:05:09.230> carbs

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
next question is what kind of carbs

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.080 
next question is what kind of carbs
should<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.280> eat<00:05:10.960> during<00:05:11.960> show<00:05:12.230> prep<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.910> want

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
should you eat during show prep you want

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.650 
should you eat during show prep you want
to<00:05:14.180> eat<00:05:14.410> carbs<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:15.590> provide<00:05:16.450> nutrition<00:05:17.450> and

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
to eat carbs that provide nutrition and

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.590 
to eat carbs that provide nutrition and
energy<00:05:18.500> without<00:05:19.300> spiking<00:05:20.300> your<00:05:20.450> insulin

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
energy without spiking your insulin

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.560 
energy without spiking your insulin
levels<00:05:21.470> so<00:05:21.710> it's<00:05:21.860> all<00:05:22.040> about<00:05:22.310> your<00:05:23.060> insulin

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
levels so it's all about your insulin

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.510 
levels so it's all about your insulin
levels<00:05:23.900> there<00:05:24.530> are<00:05:24.680> three<00:05:25.010> different<00:05:25.310> kinds

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
levels there are three different kinds

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.790 
levels there are three different kinds
of<00:05:25.580> carbs<00:05:25.880> there's<00:05:26.180> simple<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.410> refined

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
of carbs there's simple and refined

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.850 
of carbs there's simple and refined
carbs<00:05:28.700> those<00:05:28.910> are<00:05:29.060> like<00:05:29.270> sugars<00:05:30.080> like<00:05:30.350> table

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
carbs those are like sugars like table

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.910 
carbs those are like sugars like table
sugar<00:05:31.340> tablespoon<00:05:32.090> sugar<00:05:32.320> flour<00:05:33.320> breads

pasta<00:05:34.640> things<00:05:34.910> like<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.270> those<00:05:35.510> are<00:05:35.540> all

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
pasta things like that those are all

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.620 
pasta things like that those are all
sugar<00:05:36.080> bright<00:05:36.410> sugar<00:05:36.800> based<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.630> nothing

will<00:05:38.840> spike<00:05:39.110> your<00:05:39.290> insulin<00:05:39.320> levels<00:05:40.130> more<00:05:40.460> and

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
will spike your insulin levels more and

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.310 
will spike your insulin levels more and
as<00:05:41.570> quickly<00:05:42.050> as<00:05:42.350> those<00:05:42.650> do<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:44.450> Third<00:05:44.720> Kind<00:05:45.050> is

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
as quickly as those do the Third Kind is

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.740 
as quickly as those do the Third Kind is
a<00:05:45.380> complex<00:05:45.890> carb<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.460> those<00:05:46.730> take<00:05:47.120> longer<00:05:47.420> to

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
a complex carb so those take longer to

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.530 
a complex carb so those take longer to
digest<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.470> they<00:05:48.740> do<00:05:48.800> not<00:05:49.250> raise<00:05:50.030> your<00:05:50.060> and

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
digest and they do not raise your and

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.410 
digest and they do not raise your and
they<00:05:50.780> do<00:05:50.840> not<00:05:51.050> spike<00:05:51.380> your<00:05:51.590> insulin<00:05:51.620> levels

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
they do not spike your insulin levels

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.900 
they do not spike your insulin levels
within<00:05:53.420> complex<00:05:54.020> complex<00:05:54.770> carbs<00:05:55.310> excuse<00:05:55.790> me
