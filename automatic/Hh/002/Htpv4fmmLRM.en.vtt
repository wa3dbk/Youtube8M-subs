00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.380
 At this point I would like to congratulate her on Zwiesel 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.880
 3 to 2 - success over red and white food 2 this sounds like the result already 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.210
 a bit close to the just in the post, but already belongs 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.370
 totally clear at the end also absolutely deserved victory for you or Kaya 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 think smoking was the work going on 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.210
 Parma suddenly Hillman can make two mistakes like her fair dealing with them 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.859
 that Siemens continues 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.349
 but this time percent 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.409
 we play a very decent foot over 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.439
 but on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969
 After the gut feeling we score a gate around the system 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.280
 make a fair underway cashier wander what they are so now though 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.859
 Drohsel min think sing me 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.090
 in good way 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.010
 Sometimes you despair a bit on the pitch or do you think 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.150
 a little bit too much if you need so many chances to score 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.480
 achieve 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.760
 have you think 9 I am running game 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.800
 No we do not have time 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.820
 Of course sometimes sometimes that some I have what is like in football 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.060
 I do not think not only that already experienced 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 then let's take a look at the results from the nrw league at least the the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760
 yes because the beats would be relevant I would almost say now and then are too 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.490
 just this a result what we have just seen in pictures 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.530
 Bonner SC Schlüter and way of 2 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.619
 3 to 2 and the education Schirmbeck against Fortuna Cologne 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.280
 has been 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.720
 canceled the next matches Bonner SC against MSV Duisburg 2 am 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.819
 Wednesday at 17:30 and also on Wednesday Germania Dattenfeld 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.610
 SC Fortuna 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 Cologne then we look at the table 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.119
 the nrw league and the picture or still offers a relatively coarse picture 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.410
 At this point you say Photo Eer will have to be on top of two for the table 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.320
 56 points 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.710
 and that's 13 points ahead of the Bonn SC on the fourth 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.350
 Table position is 13 points I'll say it again like that sounds now 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.060
 First, totally Philippe but you have to look here for the games lock 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 Düsseldorfer five games more and sets Alemannia Aachen 2 have six 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.820
 Play more than the Bonn SC because you can really Rainer crooked table stands 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.979
 We are talking about the process and we are playing Fortuna Köln with 21 games 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.209
 even on the first half 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 ninth place in the table again 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.009
 that's about us too 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.879
 Mauch Kahlohr Show already touched on that will now Naldi paused the song 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.190
 Phase ahead of you 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.149
 in the next ten weeks with those 16 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.849
 17 play the data almost more and more English week 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.120
 how do you have to have light or mentally on it? 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.559
 to prepare 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.299
 yes that is always 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.169
 Velen we always look game to game would be me they have percent before us 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.139
 the pass through 0 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.559
 and then we drive to Herne 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.509
 Everyone has done a very hard preparation 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.379
 and I hope that now the LANCOM of these games can play with it 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.589
 can show users of strength 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.469
 they can percent the percent 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.290
 after a miserable ex of the young ladies in the hall in the year 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.779
 that was not his only better worry 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:08.849
 but 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.820
 In the end, we can count on change or second place 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.940
 I expect a little bit now if you look at the table 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.949
 you always say good we have 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.059
 Although 13 points behind but it is also over five games less 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.899
 these are the beginning of one with the pressure in these five pick-up games 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.969
 Above you have the pressure to win these games necessarily 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.130
 "I do not like to hear patterns 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.899
 I have mine 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.639
 A US models opinion Dolphins shipments we die but we can 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.729
 these five play 13 points is Feo 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.259
 but Klose 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.589
 Werner Lanwehr GM around the proximity of the games so as percent of our conscious as 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:53.559
 WG the red-white food and and Weseke then win all five citizens we 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.989
 Although have a lane point projection but if 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.969
 I do not know where 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.699
 Pepe and promote what still make play Spielberger still play 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:04.959
 scoresheet 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.619
 and we still have to smoke at home therefore approx 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.089
 and Customers "I'm already looking forward to heaping up these games 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.389
 Selmani from the basic requirement that you look forward to these games 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:15.949
 Roczen 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:19.569
 pressure to address by name must have come now also so 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.950
 a bit in the environment also from the media in Bonn 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.770
 a little bit 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.310
 Criticism on Föhr on 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.970
 because I was always so Grunder state that did not run very well 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.349
 how do you think that was as a team or how do you go with them? 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.849
 the pressure from the outside by the media with the pressure of their crew 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.509
 HBH it was not easy for bore to be arbitrary 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.449
 always a high expectation 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.620
 course, beforehand that Daring one does not work 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.800
 and this to the special page which now to the lights I think that very much 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.440
 that way I tried in the car on highways 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.500
 just as the son of the execution point no jam but she sits since 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.570
 Its introduction therefore needs a short time this huge highway 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.690
 that was boring a hundred percent sure we are in good shape around the 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.499
 Direction is not wrong either 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.199
 The Bonn SC Press on their moment with on the acceleration strip 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.410
 have to stay at the highway so last two games were won 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.050
 the finals on average a Ferhat 4 in the cup was reached so 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.900
 that's also a very good record and have been solid throughout 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.390
 keep their fingers crossed for the hard weeks now with the many 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.819
 English weeks on Wednesday 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.819
 already further I say yes again home game if it's 5:30 against the MSV 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.770
 Duisburg 2 Dalibor many thanks for the sympathetic appearance or 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.310
 more 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.999
 was very fun 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.029
 yes, good luck 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.699
 for the upcoming tasks and also for you one 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.479
 injury free back round still open in this case that one what 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:49.860
 there is
