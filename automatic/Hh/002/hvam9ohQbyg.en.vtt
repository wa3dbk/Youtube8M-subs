00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
acute you can kind of tell if there are

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
acute you can kind of tell if there are
outlines<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.739> something<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.100> might<00:02:56.190> have

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
outlines of something that might have

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
been here for the second hole because

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.400 
been here for the second hole because
the<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.510> stock<00:03:00.510> bumper<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.959> goes<00:03:01.080> right<00:03:01.260> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the the stock bumper just goes right on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530 
the the stock bumper just goes right on
the<00:03:01.680> bolt<00:03:01.860> these<00:03:02.010> uh<00:03:02.120> screws<00:03:03.120> go<00:03:03.300> into<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the bolt these uh screws go into the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.330 
the bolt these uh screws go into the
holes<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.530> almost<00:03:04.709> looks<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.160> weird

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
holes and it almost looks it's weird

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.440 
holes and it almost looks it's weird
that<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.550> wouldn't<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.790> make<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that they wouldn't just make it just the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.870 
that they wouldn't just make it just the
metal<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.050> little<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:07.680> longer<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.580> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
metal just a little bit longer and that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.820 
metal just a little bit longer and that
that's<00:03:09.209> kind<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.450> how<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.410> its<00:03:10.560> medieval

that's kind of how you know its medieval

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
that's kind of how you know its medieval
because<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:11.489> seem<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.910> they<00:03:12.300> seem<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.570> make

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
because they seem to they seem to make

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.880 
because they seem to they seem to make
good<00:03:12.900> stuff<00:03:13.110> but<00:03:13.260> there's<00:03:13.410> always<00:03:13.530> something

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
good stuff but there's always something

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.150 
good stuff but there's always something
wrong<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.580> these<00:03:15.890> lights<00:03:16.890> and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
wrong like with the these lights and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.620 
wrong like with the these lights and
like<00:03:17.280> my<00:03:17.430> taillights<00:03:17.850> one<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.209> screws<00:03:18.450> not

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
like my taillights one the screws not

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.699 
like my taillights one the screws not
fitting<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.019> they<00:03:19.110> send<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.440> send<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
fitting that they send they send the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.140 
fitting that they send they send the
same<00:03:19.860> screws<00:03:20.100> every<00:03:20.310> time<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.610> everybody<00:03:20.970> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
same screws every time to everybody and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.940 
same screws every time to everybody and
they<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.390> actually<00:03:21.600> work<00:03:22.019> which<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.769> just

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
they don't actually work which is just

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.560 
they don't actually work which is just
weird<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.340> kind<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.549> like<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.150> guys<00:03:24.269> can't

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
weird it's kind of like you guys can't

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.330 
weird it's kind of like you guys can't
just<00:03:24.630> get<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> right<00:03:25.049> kind<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> screws<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.530> it

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
just get the right kind of screws and it

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.560 
just get the right kind of screws and it
seems<00:03:26.549> like<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.880> either<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.450> I'm

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
seems like this is either like I'm

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.520 
seems like this is either like I'm
saying<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:27.930> either<00:03:28.049> because<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.380> see

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
saying it's either because you can see

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.380 
saying it's either because you can see
these<00:03:28.650> outlines<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.239> either

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
these outlines here so it's either

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.550 
these outlines here so it's either
missing<00:03:30.750> I'm<00:03:30.870> either<00:03:31.019> missing<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.350> piece<00:03:31.500> that
