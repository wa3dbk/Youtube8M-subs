00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
all right so as you heard I mean I think

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.830 
all right so as you heard I mean I think
it<00:00:42.350> sounds<00:00:42.530> better<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.850> power<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.360> back<00:00:44.570> it's

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
it sounds better the power is back it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.650 
it sounds better the power is back it's
easier<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.290> start<00:00:46.000> it's<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.270> as<00:00:47.390> easy<00:00:47.540> to

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
easier to start it's just as easy to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.290 
easier to start it's just as easy to
start<00:00:47.960> as<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.290> as<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.710> was<00:00:48.830> with<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.300> factory

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
start as it as it was with the factory

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.510 
start as it as it was with the factory
muffler<00:00:50.629> on<00:00:50.780> there<00:00:50.989> but<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.920> power<00:00:52.129> did<00:00:52.309> come

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
muffler on there but the power did come

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.130 
muffler on there but the power did come
back<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.180> sound<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> little<00:00:53.900> better<00:00:54.080> I

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
back and the sound is a little better I

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.979 
back and the sound is a little better I
think<00:00:54.290> it's<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.559> little<00:00:54.800> hollow<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.510> so<00:00:56.510> what

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
think it's a little hollow and so what

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.799 
think it's a little hollow and so what
I'm<00:00:57.080> gonna<00:00:57.199> do<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:58.210> I'm<00:00:59.210> gonna<00:00:59.330> leave<00:00:59.600> this

pipe<00:01:15.530> here<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:16.550> drill<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.970> out<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.420> that

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
pipe here and then drill it out so that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.060 
pipe here and then drill it out so that
it's<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:18.820> larger<00:01:19.820> diameter<00:01:20.000> than<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's a larger diameter than what that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.550 
it's a larger diameter than what that
allows<00:01:22.399> and<00:01:22.789> then<00:01:23.690> we'll<00:01:23.810> see<00:01:23.930> how<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.170> sounds

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
I removed all the guts or some of the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.510 
I removed all the guts or some of the
guts<00:02:04.429> out<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.020> inside<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.200> muffler<00:02:06.520> so

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
guts out of the inside of the muffler so

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.170 
guts out of the inside of the muffler so
the<00:02:07.610> power<00:02:07.789> came<00:02:08.000> back<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.390> sound<00:02:10.150> okay<00:02:11.150> I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
the power came back the sound okay I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.020 
the power came back the sound okay I
mean<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.660> sounds<00:02:11.870> like<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.019> go-kart<00:02:12.319> with<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:13.030> you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
mean it sounds like a go-kart with a you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 
mean it sounds like a go-kart with a you
know<00:02:14.150> one<00:02:14.299> of<00:02:14.330> those<00:02:14.420> boom<00:02:14.750> tube<00:02:15.019> bufflers<00:02:15.410> on

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
know one of those boom tube bufflers on

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.910 
know one of those boom tube bufflers on
there<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.150> that's<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.360> sounds<00:02:17.569> like

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
there so that's what it sounds like

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.500 
there so that's what it sounds like
putting<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> end<00:02:19.220> cap<00:02:19.489> back<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.910> did<00:02:20.120> quiet

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
putting the end cap back on did quiet

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.809 
putting the end cap back on did quiet
the<00:02:21.260> exhaust<00:02:21.590> tone<00:02:21.829> back<00:02:22.160> down<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> little<00:02:22.670> bit

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
the exhaust tone back down a little bit

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.940 
the exhaust tone back down a little bit
in<00:02:23.060> fact<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.599> think<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.870> sounds<00:02:24.200> almost<00:02:24.410> exactly

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
in fact I think it sounds almost exactly

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.210 
in fact I think it sounds almost exactly
like<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.459> factory<00:02:26.269> muffler<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.130> can

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
like the factory muffler and as you can

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.319 
like the factory muffler and as you can
see<00:02:28.280> there<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.549> did<00:02:28.760> cut<00:02:28.940> off<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> little

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
see there I did cut off the little

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.539 
see there I did cut off the little
tailpipe<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.019> then<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.739> drilled<00:02:31.040> out<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.370> hole

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
tailpipe and then I drilled out the hole

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.770 
tailpipe and then I drilled out the hole
to<00:02:31.880> 5/8<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.510> an<00:02:32.630> inch<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.880> anyway<00:02:34.880> I'm<00:02:35.569> done

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
to 5/8 of an inch so anyway I'm done

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.380 
to 5/8 of an inch so anyway I'm done
messing<00:02:36.019> with<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:36.440> might<00:02:36.970> take<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.150> cap

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
messing with it I might take this cap

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.550 
messing with it I might take this cap
off<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.049> have<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> loud<00:02:44.290> bike<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.530> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
off just just to have a loud bike with a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.759 
off just just to have a loud bike with a
go-kart<00:02:46.220> engine<00:02:46.459> on<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.730> basically<00:02:47.769> but

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
go-kart engine on it basically but
