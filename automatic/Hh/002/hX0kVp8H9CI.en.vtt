which<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.950> think<00:02:43.220> more<00:02:43.430> first-person<00:02:44.000> shooters

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
which I think more first-person shooters

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.820 
which I think more first-person shooters
should<00:02:44.360> look<00:02:44.510> into<00:02:44.660> doing<00:02:44.840> these<00:02:45.110> days<00:02:45.319> some

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
should look into doing these days some

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.290 
should look into doing these days some
of<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.099> know<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.489> think<00:02:46.610> should<00:02:47.030> stick

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
of them I know it's I think should stick

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.940 
of them I know it's I think should stick
to<00:02:47.420> single<00:02:47.690> players<00:02:47.930> as<00:02:48.200> well<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:48.500> multiplayer

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
to single players as well as multiplayer

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.220 
to single players as well as multiplayer
just<00:02:49.160> because<00:02:49.400> they're<00:02:49.970> more<00:02:50.330> well-known<00:02:50.569> for

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
their single player campaigns so why

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.620 
their single player campaigns so why

many<00:03:08.819> different<00:03:08.909> factors<00:03:09.420> that's<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.620> battle

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
many different factors that's the battle

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.530 
many different factors that's the battle
for<00:03:10.950> games<00:03:11.129> kind<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.430> focus<00:03:12.030> around<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.390> it's

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
for games kind of focus around so it's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.300 
for games kind of focus around so it's
not<00:03:12.629> just<00:03:12.689> like<00:03:12.989> one<00:03:13.230> individual<00:03:13.950> thing<00:03:14.099> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
not just like one individual thing that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.710 
not just like one individual thing that
that's<00:03:14.370> what<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> main<00:03:14.849> focus<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.299> about<00:03:15.510> it's

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that's what the main focus is about it's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.710 
that's what the main focus is about it's
over<00:03:16.079> everything<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:16.980> mag<00:03:17.720> really

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
over everything and I think mag really

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.869 
over everything and I think mag really
it<00:03:18.959> doesn't<00:03:19.170> pop<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.739> not<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.950> direct<00:03:20.400> copy<00:03:20.640> of

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
it doesn't pop is not a direct copy of

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.819 
it doesn't pop is not a direct copy of
it<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.150> think<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.599> tries<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.709> I

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
it but I think it tries to do it and I

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.319 
it but I think it tries to do it and I
think<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.099> does<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.489> personally<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.030> feel<00:03:24.180> it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
think it does it personally I feel it

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.149 
think it does it personally I feel it
does<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> very<00:03:24.750> well<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.709> different<00:03:25.950> way

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
does it very well but in a different way

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.789 
does it very well but in a different way
now<00:03:26.609> there<00:03:27.599> are<00:03:27.720> three<00:03:27.780> main<00:03:28.170> reasons<00:03:28.200> as<00:03:28.769> to

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
now there are three main reasons as to

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.680 
now there are three main reasons as to
why<00:03:28.950> i<00:03:29.129> feel<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.489> mag<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> such<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> fantastic

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
why i feel that mag is such a fantastic

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.979 
why i feel that mag is such a fantastic

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
don't get anything out of it so you

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.500 
don't get anything out of it so you
don't<00:06:19.160> get<00:06:19.250> any<00:06:19.400> added<00:06:19.820> bonuses<00:06:20.240> now<00:06:20.300> you

don't get any added bonuses now you
don't<00:06:20.660> lose<00:06:20.930> anything<00:06:21.229> you<00:06:21.470> just<00:06:21.500> don't<00:06:21.740> get

any<00:06:21.860> extra<00:06:22.280> bonuses<00:06:22.789> so<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.539> I<00:06:23.570> think<00:06:23.840> it's

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
any extra bonuses so that I think it's

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.080 
any extra bonuses so that I think it's
really<00:06:24.169> it<00:06:24.380> really<00:06:24.620> shows<00:06:25.280> how<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:25.789> your

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
really it really shows how that your

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.760 
really it really shows how that your
actions<00:06:26.240> individually<00:06:27.169> can<00:06:27.320> affect<00:06:27.620> your

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
actions individually can affect your

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.350 
actions individually can affect your
overall<00:06:27.890> faction<00:06:28.729> because<00:06:28.940> if<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.210> could

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
overall faction because if you could

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.880 
overall faction because if you could
have<00:06:29.450> done<00:06:29.570> one<00:06:29.780> more<00:06:29.960> thing<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.350> would<00:06:30.800> have

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
have done one more thing that would have

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.200 
have done one more thing that would have
saved<00:06:31.100> the<00:06:31.310> match<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.700> prevented<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.180> from

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
saved the match and prevented you from

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.510 
saved the match and prevented you from
losing<00:06:32.539> next<00:06:33.320> thing<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.530> know<00:06:33.560> you<00:06:34.039> lost<00:06:34.310> an

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
losing next thing you know you lost an

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.920 
losing next thing you know you lost an
extra<00:06:34.820> five<00:06:35.030> percent<00:06:35.390> experience<00:06:35.810> points

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
extra five percent experience points

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.360 
extra five percent experience points
that<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.260> would<00:06:36.440> have<00:06:36.500> gotten<00:06:36.770> previously

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
that you would have gotten previously

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.070 
that you would have gotten previously
now<00:06:37.520> you<00:06:37.580> gotta<00:06:37.820> wait<00:06:38.000> until<00:06:38.180> that's<00:06:38.840> in<00:06:39.050> a

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
now you gotta wait until that's in a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.690 
now you gotta wait until that's in a
sense<00:06:39.260> that<00:06:39.350> glass<00:06:39.620> refills<00:06:40.100> after<00:06:40.400> you<00:06:40.490> play

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
sense that glass refills after you play

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.460 
sense that glass refills after you play
it<00:06:40.820> your<00:06:41.030> faction<00:06:41.450> plays<00:06:41.630> enough<00:06:41.900> games<00:06:42.169> and

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
it your faction plays enough games and

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.350 
it your faction plays enough games and
wins<00:06:42.710> in<00:06:43.160> order<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.460> regain<00:06:43.639> it<00:06:43.910> back<00:06:44.060> so<00:06:44.330> that

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
wins in order to regain it back so that

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.210 
wins in order to regain it back so that
to<00:06:44.690> me<00:06:44.780> is<00:06:44.960> a<00:06:45.260> great<00:06:45.590> thing<00:06:45.740> they<00:06:45.889> put<00:06:46.010> in<00:06:46.070> this

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
to me is a great thing they put in this

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.680 
to me is a great thing they put in this
game<00:06:46.370> I<00:06:46.490> think<00:06:46.940> it's<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.150> lot<00:06:47.240> of<00:06:47.330> fun<00:06:47.419> if<00:06:47.600> you

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
game I think it's a lot of fun if you

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.090 
game I think it's a lot of fun if you
maybe<00:06:47.840> you're<00:06:48.320> still<00:06:48.470> a<00:06:48.500> little<00:06:48.560> bit<00:06:48.770> confused

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
maybe you're still a little bit confused

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.550 
maybe you're still a little bit confused
on<00:06:49.220> that<00:06:49.250> I<00:06:49.550> may<00:06:50.479> try<00:06:50.630> to<00:06:50.690> find<00:06:50.900> a<00:06:50.990> video<00:06:51.200> or<00:06:51.260> can

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
on that I may try to find a video or can

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.529 
on that I may try to find a video or can
go<00:06:51.650> search<00:06:51.830> for<00:06:51.860> one<00:06:52.160> that<00:06:52.700> explains<00:06:53.330> a<00:06:53.419> little

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
go search for one that explains a little

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.260 
go search for one that explains a little
bit<00:06:53.750> better<00:06:54.039> finally<00:06:55.039> the<00:06:55.610> last<00:06:55.639> thing<00:06:56.030> is<00:06:56.240> the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
bit better finally the last thing is the

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.700 
bit better finally the last thing is the
chain<00:06:56.570> of<00:06:56.690> commands<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.200> chain<00:06:57.350> of<00:06:57.380> commands

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
chain of commands the chain of commands

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.219 
chain of commands the chain of commands
in<00:06:57.860> mag<00:06:58.039> is<00:06:58.250> great<00:06:58.760> they<00:06:59.090> have<00:06:59.240> squad<00:06:59.600> platoon

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
in mag is great they have squad platoon

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.379 
in mag is great they have squad platoon
and<00:07:00.470> the<00:07:00.530> OIC<00:07:01.400> or<00:07:01.520> officer<00:07:01.850> in<00:07:01.940> charge<00:07:01.970> those

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
and the OIC or officer in charge those

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.170 
and the OIC or officer in charge those
three<00:07:02.630> leaders<00:07:02.900> are<00:07:03.260> I<00:07:04.130> think<00:07:04.580> is<00:07:04.700> something

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
three leaders are I think is something

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.600 
three leaders are I think is something
that<00:07:05.450> other<00:07:05.840> FPS<00:07:06.200> games<00:07:06.650> should<00:07:06.770> look<00:07:06.950> into<00:07:07.100> in

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
that other FPS games should look into in

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.879 
that other FPS games should look into in
games<00:07:08.419> like<00:07:08.600> domination<00:07:09.200> and<00:07:09.289> acquisition
