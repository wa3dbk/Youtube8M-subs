00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
doing the first hop addition we are at

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.250 
doing the first hop addition we are at
about<00:00:07.220> 192<00:00:08.220> degrees<00:00:08.700> I'm<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.809> gonna<00:00:09.990> bring

about 192 degrees I'm not gonna bring

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.089 
about 192 degrees I'm not gonna bring
this<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.650> full<00:00:11.010> 212<00:00:11.910> degree<00:00:12.210> boil<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:13.099> usually

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
this to a full 212 degree boil I usually

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.300 
this to a full 212 degree boil I usually
try<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.429> keep<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.820> around<00:00:15.680> between<00:00:16.680> 190<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
try and keep it around between 190 and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.980 
try and keep it around between 190 and
200<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.210> usually<00:00:18.720> mean<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.020> three<00:00:19.199> pounds

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
200 so usually mean like three pounds

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.790 
200 so usually mean like three pounds
what<00:00:21.699> usually<00:00:22.699> be<00:00:23.240> like<00:00:23.419> three<00:00:23.599> times

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
just you know open up the ball valve and

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.619 
just you know open up the ball valve and
I<00:00:58.629> took<00:00:59.320> about<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.559> half<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.949> glass<00:01:00.250> full<00:01:00.640> out<00:01:01.390> of

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
I took about a half a glass full out of

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.410 
I took about a half a glass full out of
the<00:01:02.520> boiler<00:01:03.520> I'm<00:01:03.760> gonna<00:01:03.940> wait<00:01:04.119> for<00:01:04.300> this<00:01:04.360> to

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the boiler I'm gonna wait for this to

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.180 
the boiler I'm gonna wait for this to
cool<00:01:04.660> down<00:01:04.869> I'm<00:01:05.050> gonna<00:01:05.199> add<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.890> yeast

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
cool down I'm gonna add it to the yeast

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.190 
cool down I'm gonna add it to the yeast
that'll<00:01:07.060> give<00:01:07.180> them<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.330> few<00:01:07.570> hours<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:08.050> work

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
that'll give them a few hours to work

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.889 
that'll give them a few hours to work
with<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.590> before<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.950> eventually<00:01:09.190> pitch<00:01:09.610> them

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
with it before I eventually pitch them

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.150 
with it before I eventually pitch them
yeah<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:11.110> can<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:13.420> uh<00:01:13.630> that's<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.619> sugary

yeah you can that's uh that's a sugary

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.779 
yeah you can that's uh that's a sugary

go over here and take a look inside here
just<00:01:21.009> look<00:01:21.940> at<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.300> we're<00:01:22.450> sitting<00:01:23.229> in<00:01:23.320> about

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
just look at it we're sitting in about

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.260 
just look at it we're sitting in about
two<00:01:23.770> hundred<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.130> two<00:01:24.280> degrees<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.030> boil

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
two hundred and two degrees for the boil

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.930 
two hundred and two degrees for the boil
comfortably<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:25.990> had<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:26.619> on<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.860> believe<00:01:27.820> it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
comfortably I had this on a believe it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.370 
comfortably I had this on a believe it
or<00:01:28.030> not<00:01:28.090> that's<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.600> lower<00:01:29.550> energy<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.869> we're

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
or not that's a lower energy and we're

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.350 
or not that's a lower energy and we're
doing<00:01:32.619> hop<00:01:32.799> additions<00:01:33.310> she's<00:01:33.909> doing<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.240> hop

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
doing hop additions she's doing the hop

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.600 
doing hop additions she's doing the hop
additions<00:01:34.750> every<00:01:34.990> three<00:01:35.259> minutes<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
additions every three minutes have the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.360 
additions every three minutes have the
next<00:01:36.880> one

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.160 

two<00:01:40.370> minutes<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.150> if<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.660> see<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.960> table

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
two minutes and if you see on the table

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.640 
two minutes and if you see on the table
we<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.680> lot<00:01:42.920> left<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.250> go<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:45.320> I'm<00:01:45.380> gonna<00:01:45.500> be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
we have a lot left to go so I'm gonna be

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.380 
we have a lot left to go so I'm gonna be
here<00:01:45.830> for<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.980> little<00:01:46.100> while<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.640> just<00:01:46.970> clean<00:01:47.240> out

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
here for a little while I just clean out

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.030 
here for a little while I just clean out
these<00:01:47.570> two<00:01:47.810> parameters<00:01:48.050> here<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.890> where

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
these two parameters here this is where

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.530 
these two parameters here this is where
the<00:01:49.100> dogfish<00:01:49.550> Head<00:01:49.580> Coulomb<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.180> going<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.390> be

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
the dogfish Head Coulomb is going to be

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.190 
the dogfish Head Coulomb is going to be
sitting<00:01:50.930> for<00:01:50.960> many<00:01:51.440> many<00:01:51.710> months<00:01:53.020> I'm<00:01:54.020> not

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
sitting for many many months I'm not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.900 
sitting for many many months I'm not
going<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.440> use<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.920> typical

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
going to use the typical

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.110 
going to use the typical
airlock<00:01:56.300> I'll<00:01:56.720> be<00:01:56.960> using

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
airlock I'll be using

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.880 
airlock I'll be using
to<00:02:00.120> sanitize<00:02:00.660> these<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.260> these<00:02:01.380> work<00:02:01.620> really

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to sanitize these but these work really

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.250 
to sanitize these but these work really
well<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.190> high<00:02:02.520> gravity<00:02:02.760> beers<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.510> are<00:02:03.660> I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
well for high gravity beers these are I

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.990 
well for high gravity beers these are I
got<00:02:04.830> these<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.070> northern<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.730> their

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
got these from northern for their

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.640 
got these from northern for their
blow-off<00:02:06.240> tubing<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.260> work<00:02:07.410> well

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
blow-off tubing they really work well

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.310 
blow-off tubing they really work well
for<00:02:08.010> those<00:02:08.670> violent<00:02:09.300> fermentations<00:02:10.080> like

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
for those violent fermentations like

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.450 
for those violent fermentations like
this<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.710> is<00:02:10.830> definitely<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:13.460> so

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
this one is definitely going to have so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.940 
this one is definitely going to have so
just<00:02:15.060> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.690> hanging<00:02:16.230> around<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.740> just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just kind of hanging around and just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.680 
just kind of hanging around and just
throwing<00:02:17.610> some<00:02:17.850> hops<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.270> every<00:02:18.480> three

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
throwing some hops in every three

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.120 
throwing some hops in every three
minutes<00:02:18.840> making<00:02:19.350> sure<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.890> thing

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
minutes making sure that this thing

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.900 
minutes making sure that this thing
doesn't<00:02:20.400> get<00:02:20.580> too<00:02:20.730> hot<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:22.470> right<00:02:22.910> we're

doesn't get too hot all right we're

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.140 
doesn't get too hot all right we're
still<00:02:24.240> doing<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.720> hop<00:02:24.960> additions<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
still doing the hop additions it is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.120 
still doing the hop additions it is
12:20<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:29.220> still<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> lot<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:29.970> hops<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.660> put<00:02:30.840> in

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
12:20 we still a lot of hops to put in

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.840 
12:20 we still a lot of hops to put in
or<00:02:32.130> about<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:34.220> little<00:02:35.220> less<00:02:35.370> than<00:02:35.550> halfway

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
over the course of a month and we're

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.480 
over the course of a month and we're
just<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:01.320> ahead<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> dividing<00:03:02.130> these<00:03:02.280> up

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
just going ahead and dividing these up

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
into the right quantity so we can just

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.510 
into the right quantity so we can just
you<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.480> take<00:03:06.870> each<00:03:07.050> bag<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.590> pitch<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
you know take each bag and pitch that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.040 
you know take each bag and pitch that
don't<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.120> measure<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.540> each<00:03:09.750> time

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
don't have to measure it out each time

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.530 
don't have to measure it out each time
you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.590> an<00:03:10.709> addition<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:12.030> also<00:03:12.209> have

you want to do an addition we also have
done<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.140> hops<00:03:13.440> about<00:03:13.920> six<00:03:14.190> point

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340

done this for the hops about six point
three<00:03:14.489> grams<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.150> hops<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.660> each<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.050> these

three grams of hops in each one of these

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.190 
three grams of hops in each one of these
and<00:03:16.530> they're<00:03:17.400> labeled<00:03:17.850> for<00:03:18.120> each<00:03:18.269> number<00:03:19.110> of

and they're labeled for each number of
additions<00:03:20.300> all<00:03:21.300> right<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.989> we're<00:03:22.140> chilling

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
additions all right so we're chilling

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.560 
additions all right so we're chilling
the<00:03:22.709> wort<00:03:22.920> right<00:03:23.100> now<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.700> my<00:03:23.910> full

gallon<00:03:33.330> batch<00:03:33.690> pretty<00:03:34.050> fast<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.709> even

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
gallon batch pretty fast you can even

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.860 
gallon batch pretty fast you can even
see<00:03:35.190> that

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
see that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.440 
see that
you<00:03:37.710> guys<00:03:37.890> at<00:03:38.130> home<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.880> it's<00:03:39.300> pretty

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
you guys at home know that it's pretty

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.320 
you guys at home know that it's pretty
good<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:41.010> course<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.490> know<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.850> hose<00:03:42.030> it

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
good of course you know the hose it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.490 
good of course you know the hose it
doesn't<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:42.930> good<00:03:43.110> connection

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
doesn't have a really good connection

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.600 
doesn't have a really good connection
but<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:46.170> spoiled<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.680> two<00:03:46.830> hours<00:03:47.190> we<00:03:47.430> did

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
but it spoiled for two hours we did

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.100 
but it spoiled for two hours we did
forty<00:03:48.030> hop<00:03:48.180> additions<00:03:48.720> every<00:03:49.080> three<00:03:49.350> minutes

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
forty hop additions every three minutes

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.470 
forty hop additions every three minutes
we<00:03:52.490> took<00:03:53.490> a<00:03:53.550> little<00:03:53.730> bit<00:03:53.940> at<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> beginning

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
we took a little bit at the beginning

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.620 
we took a little bit at the beginning
and<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:55.470> pitched<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.460> starter<00:03:56.880> so

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
and I pitched that into the starter so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.270 
and I pitched that into the starter so
these<00:03:57.780> guys<00:03:58.020> sort<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:58.800> idea<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:59.130> what

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
these guys sort of have an idea of what

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.260 
these guys sort of have an idea of what
to<00:03:59.430> expect

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
to expect

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.120 
to expect
it's<00:04:02.210> about<00:04:03.210> 1,300<00:04:03.720> milliliters<00:04:04.590> which<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.100> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
it's about 1,300 milliliters which is a

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.260 
it's about 1,300 milliliters which is a
it's<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.120> massive<00:04:06.630> starter<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> ridiculous

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
it's a massive starter it's ridiculous

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.920 
it's a massive starter it's ridiculous
so<00:04:10.460> you<00:04:11.460> know<00:04:11.610> hey<00:04:12.270> we<00:04:12.390> did<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> best<00:04:12.690> we<00:04:12.900> could

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.920 
and aerate this as much as we can during
the<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.940> putting<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.450> through<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.630> funnel

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
the the putting it through the funnel

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.650 
the the putting it through the funnel
but<00:04:28.710> we<00:04:28.830> don't<00:04:28.980> have<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> aerator<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.390> we're

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
but we don't have a aerator so we're

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.300 
but we don't have a aerator so we're
just<00:04:30.690> gonna<00:04:30.900> try<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.230> splash<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:31.890> around<00:04:32.130> as

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
just gonna try and splash this around as

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.910 
just gonna try and splash this around as
much<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:32.700> possible<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.110> said<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.530> think

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
much as possible so like I said I think

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.000 
much as possible so like I said I think
we<00:04:35.160> all<00:04:35.280> did<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.780> did<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> good<00:04:36.960> job<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.500> hopefully

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
we all did a did a good job so hopefully

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.770 
we all did a did a good job so hopefully
it<00:04:38.070> comes<00:04:38.160> out<00:04:38.430> good<00:04:38.640> we'll<00:04:39.240> probably<00:04:39.450> have<00:04:39.750> a

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
it comes out good we'll probably have a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.270 
it comes out good we'll probably have a
pretty<00:04:39.960> good<00:04:40.170> idea<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.530> what<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> gravity<00:04:41.220> is

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
pretty good idea of what the gravity is

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.200 
pretty good idea of what the gravity is
gonna<00:04:41.460> be<00:04:41.640> in<00:04:42.000> about<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.480> month<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:44.130> I'm<00:04:45.000> sure

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
I'll do some more posts on beer advocate

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.210 
I'll do some more posts on beer advocate
maybe<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.090> few<00:04:48.300> more<00:04:48.420> questions<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.200> never<00:04:49.980> it's

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
maybe a few more questions so never it's

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.170 
maybe a few more questions so never it's
