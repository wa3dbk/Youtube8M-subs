they<00:01:49.000> were<00:01:49.060> amazed<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.770> saw<00:01:51.010> it<00:01:51.190> go<00:01:51.370> up<00:01:51.490> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
they were amazed and we saw it go up to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.859 
they were amazed and we saw it go up to
1,500<00:01:52.270> degrees<00:01:52.330> centigrade<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:54.070> temperature
