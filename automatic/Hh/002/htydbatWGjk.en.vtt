00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
would play better with a stylus I had a

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.490 
would play better with a stylus I had a
little<00:02:03.399> trouble<00:02:03.610> using<00:02:04.179> my<00:02:04.509> finger<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.140> grab

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
these tiny little objects and make

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.300 
these tiny little objects and make
