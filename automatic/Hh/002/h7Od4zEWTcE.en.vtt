sir<00:02:52.570> Daniels<00:02:53.050> make<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.130> roll<00:02:54.370> off<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> side

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
sir Daniels make you roll off the side

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.030 
sir Daniels make you roll off the side
not<00:02:56.830> rolled<00:02:57.610> like<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.480> fade<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.110> if<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.770> jump

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
not rolled like a fade but if you jump

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.270 
not rolled like a fade but if you jump
off<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.400> side<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.620> makes<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
off the side then it actually makes a

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.220 
off the side then it actually makes a
very<00:03:03.459> good<00:03:03.580> way<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.150> away<00:03:04.269> from<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.870> know<00:03:04.989> it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
very good way to get away from I know it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.440 
very good way to get away from I know it
doesn't<00:03:05.410> seem<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.370> find<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.000> I've

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
doesn't seem like it but I find it I've

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.740 
doesn't seem like it but I find it I've
only<00:03:07.600> play<00:03:07.810> one<00:03:08.019> online<00:03:08.530> match

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
only play one online match

only play one online match
I'm<00:03:10.080> not<00:03:10.350> saying<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.920> perfect<00:03:11.460> but<00:03:11.820> it

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
I'm not saying it's perfect but it

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.870 
I'm not saying it's perfect but it
worked<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.860> let's<00:03:13.860> be<00:03:13.980> honest<00:03:14.310> sir<00:03:14.430> Daniels

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.350 
worked and let's be honest sir Daniels
is<00:03:15.060> pretty<00:03:15.390> hard<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.660> dodge<00:03:16.190> zoning<00:03:17.360> that's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
is pretty hard to dodge zoning that's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.150 
is pretty hard to dodge zoning that's
just<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.600> little<00:03:18.750> tip<00:03:18.870> for<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.890> probably

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160

figured<00:03:20.400> out<00:03:20.610> eventually<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.630> maybe<00:03:21.960> it'll

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
figured out eventually but maybe it'll

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.590 
figured out eventually but maybe it'll
give<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> edge<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.600> that's

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
