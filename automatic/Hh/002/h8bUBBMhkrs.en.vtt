what<00:00:06.700> is<00:00:06.790> your<00:00:06.940> takeaway<00:00:07.149> from<00:00:07.359> this<00:00:07.899> kind<00:00:08.320> of

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
what is your takeaway from this kind of

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.280 
what is your takeaway from this kind of
events<00:00:08.770> and<00:00:08.950> the<00:00:09.100> immediate<00:00:09.870> reaction<00:00:10.870> is<00:00:11.049> it

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
events and the immediate reaction is it

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.930 
events and the immediate reaction is it
fairly<00:00:11.500> fairly<00:00:11.920> typical<00:00:12.250> for<00:00:12.639> this<00:00:12.670> type<00:00:12.910> of

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
fairly fairly typical for this type of

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.959 
fairly fairly typical for this type of
event<00:00:13.389> yes<00:00:14.020> this<00:00:14.260> is<00:00:14.440> worse<00:00:14.709> than<00:00:14.740> many<00:00:15.520> of<00:00:15.699> the

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
event yes this is worse than many of the

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.730 
event yes this is worse than many of the
other<00:00:16.090> events<00:00:16.360> then<00:00:16.869> since<00:00:17.289> that<00:00:17.500> there's<00:00:17.680> a

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
other events then since that there's a

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.470 
other events then since that there's a
lot<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:17.920> people<00:00:18.130> injured<00:00:18.609> as<00:00:18.789> well<00:00:18.820> as<00:00:19.119> courses

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
lot of people injured as well as courses

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.409 
lot of people injured as well as courses
people<00:00:20.140> killed<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.849> emotions<00:00:22.300> are

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
people killed and the emotions are

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.659 
people killed and the emotions are
certainly<00:00:22.779> not<00:00:23.500> not<00:00:23.859> surprising<00:00:24.519> and

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
certainly not not surprising and

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.480 
certainly not not surprising and
perfectly<00:00:25.080> understandable<00:00:26.080> overall<00:00:26.589> but<00:00:27.369> in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
perfectly understandable overall but in

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.909 
perfectly understandable overall but in
terms<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.449> how<00:00:29.140> do<00:00:29.199> we<00:00:29.470> deal<00:00:29.650> with<00:00:29.890> this

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
terms of the how do we deal with this

terms of the how do we deal with this
kind<00:00:30.249> of<00:00:30.490> problem<00:00:31.210> going<00:00:31.599> forward<00:00:31.720> how

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
kind of problem going forward how

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.180 
kind of problem going forward how
typical<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:34.360> there's<00:00:34.900> that<00:00:35.230> my

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
typical is that well there's that my

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.920 
typical is that well there's that my
fear<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.489> that<00:00:36.640> it's<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.360> be<00:00:37.450> typical

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
fear is that it's going to be typical

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.680 
fear is that it's going to be typical
namely<00:00:38.290> there'll<00:00:38.470> be<00:00:38.530> an<00:00:38.680> overreaction<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
namely there'll be an overreaction and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.500 
namely there'll be an overreaction and
an<00:00:41.290> over<00:00:41.590> extrapolation<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:43.120> got<00:00:43.270> somebody

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
an over extrapolation you got somebody

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.530 
an over extrapolation you got somebody
some<00:00:43.930> bombs<00:00:44.440> going<00:00:44.710> off<00:00:44.920> in<00:00:45.100> an<00:00:45.540> athletic

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
some bombs going off in an athletic

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.230 
some bombs going off in an athletic
event<00:00:46.630> and<00:00:47.070> clearly<00:00:48.070> any<00:00:48.400> effort<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.030> try<00:00:49.210> to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
event and clearly any effort to try to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.360 
event and clearly any effort to try to
catch<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.720> perpetrators<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.560> to<00:00:51.070> say<00:00:51.250> the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
catch the perpetrators is to say the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.030 
catch the perpetrators is to say the
least<00:00:51.400> well<00:00:51.850> worth<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.180> tax<00:00:52.570> money<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:53.860> then

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
least well worth the tax money but then

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.220 
least well worth the tax money but then
the<00:00:54.160> idea<00:00:54.490> that<00:00:54.550> there<00:00:54.850> for<00:00:55.120> all<00:00:55.600> sporting

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
the idea that there for all sporting

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.760 
the idea that there for all sporting
events<00:00:56.590> are<00:00:56.740> at<00:00:56.920> stake<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:58.930> therefore

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
events are at stake and that therefore

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.860 
events are at stake and that therefore
you<00:01:00.280> know<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.520> thousands<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.570> thousands<00:01:01.870> of

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
you know the thousands and thousands of

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.120 
you know the thousands and thousands of
sporting<00:01:02.320> events<00:01:02.590> have<00:01:02.740> to<00:01:02.800> have<00:01:02.920> extra

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
sporting events have to have extra

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.070 
sporting events have to have extra
security<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.880> kind<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.119> thing<00:01:04.330> is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
security that kind of thing is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.160 
security that kind of thing is
unfortunately<00:01:05.890> typically<00:01:06.400> as<00:01:06.670> well<00:01:06.939> a<00:01:07.479> case

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
unfortunately typically as well a case

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.889 
unfortunately typically as well a case
in<00:01:08.200> point<00:01:08.409> might<00:01:08.950> be<00:01:09.159> after<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:10.359> underwear

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
in point might be after the underwear

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.859 
in point might be after the underwear
bomber<00:01:10.929> took<00:01:11.740> place<00:01:12.600> something<00:01:13.600> had<00:01:13.719> to<00:01:13.810> be

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
bomber took place something had to be

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.200 
bomber took place something had to be
done<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:14.740> thing<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.249> was<00:01:15.369> happened<00:01:15.789> two

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
done so one thing that was happened two

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.090 
done so one thing that was happened two
things<00:01:16.420> happened<00:01:16.780> one<00:01:16.960> was<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.859> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
things happened one was that the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.340 
things happened one was that the
president<00:01:18.640> insisted<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.539> there<00:01:20.049> be<00:01:20.170> more

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
president insisted that there be more

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.130 
president insisted that there be more
air<00:01:20.590> marshals<00:01:21.039> on<00:01:21.249> airplanes<00:01:21.670> but<00:01:22.479> which<00:01:22.780> who

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
air marshals on airplanes but which who

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.330 
air marshals on airplanes but which who
couldn't<00:01:23.469> have<00:01:23.560> done<00:01:23.649> anything<00:01:23.920> about<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
couldn't have done anything about the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.679 
couldn't have done anything about the
underwear<00:01:24.549> bomber<00:01:24.670> anyway<00:01:25.240> because<00:01:25.390> he<00:01:25.569> was

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
underwear bomber anyway because he was

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.389 
underwear bomber anyway because he was
where<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.960> air<00:01:26.079> marshals<00:01:26.469> aren't<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.950> they

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
where the air marshals aren't and they

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.120 
where the air marshals aren't and they
don't<00:01:27.549> find<00:01:27.819> that<00:01:27.969> many<00:01:28.210> airplanes<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:30.009> other

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
don't find that many airplanes the other

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.399 
don't find that many airplanes the other
thing<00:01:30.340> was<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.520> body<00:01:30.759> scanner<00:01:31.179> to<00:01:32.140> try<00:01:32.350> to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
thing was a body scanner to try to

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.139 
thing was a body scanner to try to
detect<00:01:32.829> that<00:01:33.069> and<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.549> now<00:01:33.700> hundreds<00:01:34.090> of

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
detect that and so now hundreds of

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.359 
detect that and so now hundreds of
millions<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.600> dollars<00:01:34.659> has<00:01:35.259> spent<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:35.770> far<00:01:35.799> and

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
millions of dollars has spent so far and

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.429 
millions of dollars has spent so far and
it'll<00:01:36.969> be<00:01:37.090> easily<00:01:37.359> into<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.659> billions<00:01:37.869> fairly

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
it'll be easily into the billions fairly

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.440 
it'll be easily into the billions fairly
soon<00:01:38.649> if<00:01:38.950> they<00:01:39.549> continue<00:01:39.939> with<00:01:40.119> these<00:01:40.270> new

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
soon if they continue with these new

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.359 
soon if they continue with these new
body<00:01:40.659> scanner<00:01:41.049> technology<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:42.009> deal<00:01:42.189> with

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
body scanner technology to deal with

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.910 
body scanner technology to deal with
that<00:01:42.520> kind<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.789> problem<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:44.409> problem<00:01:44.679> with

that kind of problem one problem with

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.149 
that kind of problem one problem with
that<00:01:45.539> solution<00:01:46.539> is<00:01:46.749> that<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> scanners<00:01:48.009> do

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
that solution is that the scanners do

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.940 
that solution is that the scanners do
not<00:01:48.340> seem<00:01:48.609> to<00:01:48.639> be<00:01:48.789> capable<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.509> detecting<00:01:49.950> the

not seem to be capable of detecting the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.499 
not seem to be capable of detecting the
kind<00:01:51.249> of<00:01:51.369> explosive<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.060> underwear<00:01:52.479> bomber

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
kind of explosive the underwear bomber

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.080 
kind of explosive the underwear bomber
actually<00:01:53.170> had<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.709> the<00:01:54.549> other<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.909> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
actually had and the other is the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.730 
actually had and the other is the
expenses<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.749> has<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:56.020> be<00:01:56.109> extremely<00:01:56.289> high

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
expenses it has to be extremely high

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.379 
expenses it has to be extremely high
because<00:01:57.009> it<00:01:57.219> doesn't<00:01:57.729> make<00:01:57.819> any<00:01:57.999> sense<00:01:58.240> to

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
because it doesn't make any sense to

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.449 
because it doesn't make any sense to
protect<00:01:58.780> only<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.109> few<00:01:59.380> airports<00:01:59.920> or<00:02:00.069> only<00:02:00.189> some

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
protect only a few airports or only some

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.849 
protect only a few airports or only some
airports<00:02:00.999> but<00:02:01.840> rather<00:02:02.020> protect<00:02:02.560> them<00:02:02.709> all

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
airports but rather protect them all

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.739 
airports but rather protect them all
because<00:02:03.189> obviously<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.850> terrorist<00:02:04.329> who<00:02:04.569> ought

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
because obviously a terrorist who ought

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.109 
because obviously a terrorist who ought
to<00:02:04.899> get<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.139> a<00:02:05.170> plane<00:02:05.319> can<00:02:05.619> simply<00:02:05.920> find<00:02:06.119> by

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
to get on a plane can simply find by

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.770 
to get on a plane can simply find by
either<00:02:07.509> process<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.520> elimination<00:02:09.520> or<00:02:09.880> by

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
either process of elimination or by

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.740 
either process of elimination or by
looking<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.380> web<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:13.480> there

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
looking on the web actually that there

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.059 
looking on the web actually that there
are<00:02:13.840> some<00:02:14.019> airports<00:02:14.379> that<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.860> these

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
are some airports that don't have these

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.070 
are some airports that don't have these
scanners<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:15.819> simply<00:02:16.180> go<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:16.720> so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
scanners and then simply go in there so

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.780 
scanners and then simply go in there so
therefore<00:02:17.409> they<00:02:17.500> really<00:02:17.799> have<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.010> spend

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
therefore they really have to spend

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.740 
therefore they really have to spend
money<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.420> deal<00:02:19.569> with<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.870> problem<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.750> our

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
money to deal with this problem and our

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.809 
money to deal with this problem and our
analysis<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.500> one<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.859> Mark<00:02:24.189> Stewart<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.700> it

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
analysis the one that Mark Stewart of it

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.699 
analysis the one that Mark Stewart of it
I<00:02:24.969> have<00:02:25.090> done<00:02:25.230> indicates<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.319> even<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
I have done indicates that even if the

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.610 
I have done indicates that even if the
body<00:02:26.920> scanners<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.609> work<00:02:27.930> they<00:02:28.930> don't<00:02:29.319> reduce

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
body scanners do work they don't reduce

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.110 
body scanners do work they don't reduce
the<00:02:29.799> risk<00:02:30.010> enough<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.459> be<00:02:30.549> worth<00:02:30.670> their<00:02:30.879> costs

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the risk enough to be worth their costs

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.399 
the risk enough to be worth their costs
and<00:02:31.390> others<00:02:31.569> they<00:02:31.689> are<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:31.930> cost<00:02:32.230> effective

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
and others they are not cost effective

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.789 
and others they are not cost effective
and<00:02:33.180> there's<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.269> big<00:02:34.540> rush<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.840> spend<00:02:35.379> its<00:02:35.590> huge

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
and there's a big rush to spend its huge

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.289 
and there's a big rush to spend its huge
amount<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.099> money<00:02:36.159> on<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.579> technology

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
amount of money on this technology

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.839 
amount of money on this technology
before<00:02:37.959> doing<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.500> kind<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.859> analysis<00:02:39.099> and

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
before doing that kind of analysis and

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:40.860 
before doing that kind of analysis and
I'm<00:02:39.939> afraid<00:02:40.150> something<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.780> will

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
I'm afraid something like that will

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.170 
I'm afraid something like that will
happen<00:02:40.900> after<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.409> Boston<00:02:41.560> case<00:02:42.129> as<00:02:42.340> well<00:02:42.579> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
happen after the Boston case as well the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020 
happen after the Boston case as well the
emotional<00:02:43.720> impact<00:02:44.489> emotional<00:02:45.489> toll<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.879> these

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
emotional impact emotional toll on these

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.759 
emotional impact emotional toll on these
things<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.359> fairly<00:02:46.599> high<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.109> drives<00:02:47.409> I

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
things is fairly high and that drives I

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.410 
things is fairly high and that drives I
suspect<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.400> lot<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.700> these<00:02:48.819> sort<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.120> do

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
suspect a lot of these sort of do

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.199 
suspect a lot of these sort of do
something<00:02:50.109> yeah<00:02:50.650> response<00:02:51.280> by<00:02:51.670> by

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
something yeah response by by

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.479 
something yeah response by by
politicians<00:02:53.019> but<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.500> trying<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.069> separate

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
politicians but it's trying to separate

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.220 
politicians but it's trying to separate
that<00:02:54.549> out<00:02:55.349> what<00:02:56.349> would<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.620> tell<00:02:56.799> people<00:02:58.230> are

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
that out what would you tell people are

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.440 
that out what would you tell people are
the<00:02:59.409> real<00:02:59.650> risks<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.669> real<00:03:00.819> costs

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the real risks and the real costs

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.520 
the real risks and the real costs
associated<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:03.120> additional<00:03:04.120> security<00:03:04.569> on

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
associated with additional security on

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.890 
associated with additional security on

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
for these types of events yeah you'd

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.589 
for these types of events yeah you'd
really<00:03:08.139> wanted<00:03:08.489> I've<00:03:09.489> dreamed<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.450> day

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
really wanted I've dreamed for the day

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.690 
really wanted I've dreamed for the day
in<00:03:10.780> which<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.109> politicians<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.040> people

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
in which the politicians and the people

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.960 
in which the politicians and the people
in<00:03:12.819> charge<00:03:12.849> will<00:03:13.359> sort<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.019> sensible

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
in charge will sort of do a sensible

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.699 
in charge will sort of do a sensible
assessment<00:03:16.019> your<00:03:17.019> chance<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.379> being<00:03:17.530> killed

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
assessment your chance of being killed

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.819 
assessment your chance of being killed
by<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:17.919> terrorist<00:03:18.189> is<00:03:19.090> about<00:03:19.510> 1<00:03:19.720> +<00:03:19.930> 3.5<00:03:20.139> million

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
by a terrorist is about 1 + 3.5 million

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.129 
by a terrorist is about 1 + 3.5 million
per<00:03:21.159> year<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:22.299> people<00:03:22.599> should<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.109> that

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
per year and people should know that

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.050 
per year and people should know that
they<00:03:23.709> may<00:03:23.889> say<00:03:24.099> well<00:03:24.220> that's<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.579> safe<00:03:24.819> enough

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
they may say well that's not safe enough

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.240 
they may say well that's not safe enough
I<00:03:25.209> want<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.449> be<00:03:25.540> even<00:03:25.720> safer<00:03:25.949> but<00:03:26.949> they<00:03:27.069> should

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
I want to be even safer but they should

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.119 
I want to be even safer but they should
start<00:03:27.609> from<00:03:27.669> that<00:03:28.000> area<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.109> during<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:29.919> since

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
start from that area and during it since

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.250 
start from that area and during it since
911<00:03:30.879> there's<00:03:31.180> only<00:03:31.269> been<00:03:31.479> one<00:03:31.540> case<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.989> a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
911 there's only been one case of a

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.729 
911 there's only been one case of a

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
essentially get a life your chance of

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:37.800 
essentially get a life your chance of
being<00:03:36.790> killed<00:03:36.909> by<00:03:37.090> terrorists<00:03:37.510> about<00:03:37.690> the

re-elected<00:03:45.549> two<00:03:45.940> years<00:03:46.180> later<00:03:46.449> so<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.319> may<00:03:47.409> not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
re-elected two years later so it may not

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.050 
re-elected two years later so it may not
be<00:03:47.709> completely<00:03:48.010> hopeless<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:48.790> fact<00:03:48.970> that

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
be completely hopeless but the fact that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.780 
be completely hopeless but the fact that
no<00:03:49.269> one<00:03:49.299> knows<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.109> says<00:03:50.409> that<00:03:50.790> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
no one knows that and says that is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.300 
no one knows that and says that is
absurd<00:03:52.209> essentially<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.199> issue<00:03:53.409> is<00:03:53.799> not<00:03:53.979> are

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
absurd essentially the issue is not are

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.939 
absurd essentially the issue is not are
we<00:03:54.340> safer<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:56.019> don't<00:03:56.169> start<00:03:56.409> from<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.590> you

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
we safer you don't start from that you

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.089 
we safer you don't start from that you
start<00:03:57.280> from<00:03:57.489> how<00:03:57.849> safe<00:03:58.299> are<00:03:58.599> we<00:03:59.099> clearly

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
start from how safe are we clearly

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.729 
start from how safe are we clearly
adding<00:04:00.519> one<00:04:00.699> bomb<00:04:01.449> detecting<00:04:02.109> dog<00:04:02.319> in<00:04:02.590> one

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
adding one bomb detecting dog in one

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
adding one bomb detecting dog in one
airport<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.400> some<00:04:03.579> sense<00:04:03.849> makes<00:04:04.120> us<00:04:04.299> safer

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
airport in some sense makes us safer

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.039 
airport in some sense makes us safer
that<00:04:05.319> doesn't<00:04:05.620> mean<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:05.949> good<00:04:06.099> idea<00:04:06.280> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
that doesn't mean it's a good idea and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.990 
that doesn't mean it's a good idea and
so<00:04:08.049> where<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.470> start<00:04:08.769> with<00:04:08.949> is<00:04:09.250> this<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.879> know

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
so where you start with is this you know

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.240 
so where you start with is this you know
some<00:04:10.569> sense<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.109> how<00:04:11.199> safe<00:04:11.470> where<00:04:11.650> we<00:04:11.739> are<00:04:11.919> in

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
some sense of how safe where we are in

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.869 
some sense of how safe where we are in
the<00:04:12.430> safety<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:15.489> terrorist<00:04:15.819> threat

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
the safety the the the terrorist threat

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.509 
the safety the the the terrorist threat
such<00:04:16.509> as<00:04:16.659> it<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.810> that's<00:04:17.650> suggest<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.280> one

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
such as it is that's suggest that one

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.460 
such as it is that's suggest that one
out<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.699> every<00:04:18.849> 3.5<00:04:19.299> million<00:04:19.959> people<00:04:20.380> are

extremely low number the FBI has I guess

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
have been able to do it on their own now

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.400 
have been able to do it on their own now
one<00:05:40.280> thing<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.520> has<00:05:40.700> been<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.270> Boston<00:05:41.990> cases

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.460 
one thing it has been the Boston cases
is<00:05:43.310> notable<00:05:44.030> for<00:05:44.090> is<00:05:44.510> that<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.260> first

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
is notable for is that this is the first

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.910 
is notable for is that this is the first
time<00:05:45.850> anybody<00:05:47.050> since<00:05:48.050> nine<00:05:48.290> eleven<00:05:48.440> a

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
time anybody since nine eleven a

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.340 
time anybody since nine eleven a
terrorist<00:05:49.430> has<00:05:49.580> been<00:05:49.730> able<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:50.060> detonate<00:05:50.810> even

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
terrorist has been able to detonate even

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.970 
terrorist has been able to detonate even
a<00:05:51.440> simple<00:05:51.650> bomb<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:53.330> that's<00:05:53.780> that's<00:05:54.050> unique<00:05:54.470> in

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
a simple bomb so that's that's unique in

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.040 
a simple bomb so that's that's unique in
the<00:05:55.070> key<00:05:55.190> also<00:05:55.400> in<00:05:55.610> case<00:05:55.760> of<00:05:55.910> Britain<00:05:56.210> except

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
the key also in case of Britain except

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.000 
the key also in case of Britain except
for<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.200> four<00:05:57.440> bombs<00:05:57.650> or<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:58.010> ignited<00:05:58.370> in<00:05:59.090> the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
for the four bombs or it ignited in the

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.380 
for the four bombs or it ignited in the
attack<00:06:01.010> on<00:06:01.160> the<00:06:01.190> transit<00:06:01.610> system<00:06:01.940> in<00:06:02.030> London

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
attack on the transit system in London

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.260 
attack on the transit system in London
in<00:06:02.510> 2005<00:06:03.200> no<00:06:04.010> terrorists<00:06:04.520> in<00:06:04.730> Britain<00:06:05.120> has

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
in 2005 no terrorists in Britain has

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.150 
in 2005 no terrorists in Britain has
been<00:06:05.420> able<00:06:05.540> to<00:06:05.690> detonate<00:06:06.170> even<00:06:06.680> his<00:06:06.800> simple

been able to detonate even his simple

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.790 
been able to detonate even his simple
bomb<00:06:07.510> what's<00:06:08.510> impressive<00:06:08.750> about<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:09.290> is

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
bomb what's impressive about this is

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.940 
bomb what's impressive about this is
that<00:06:09.860> in<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.340> 1970s<00:06:11.270> there<00:06:12.050> were<00:06:12.260> dozens<00:06:12.530> and

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
that in the 1970s there were dozens and

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.940 
that in the 1970s there were dozens and
dozens<00:06:13.010> of<00:06:13.580> bombings<00:06:14.030> in<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.270> United<00:06:14.600> States

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
dozens of bombings in the United States

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.640 
dozens of bombings in the United States
resulting<00:06:15.950> in<00:06:16.040> the<00:06:16.100> death<00:06:16.310> of<00:06:16.690> some<00:06:17.690> 70<00:06:18.290> people

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
resulting in the death of some 70 people

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.680 
resulting in the death of some 70 people
over<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.700> course<00:06:19.730> of<00:06:20.000> that<00:06:20.150> whole<00:06:20.330> decade

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
over the course of that whole decade

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.150 
over the course of that whole decade
that's<00:06:21.020> still<00:06:21.200> not<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.380> huge<00:06:21.620> number<00:06:21.680> but<00:06:21.950> it's

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
that's still not a huge number but it's

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.980 
that's still not a huge number but it's
certainly<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.430> large<00:06:22.640> number<00:06:23.060> much<00:06:23.540> larger

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
certainly a large number much larger

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.350 
certainly a large number much larger
than<00:06:24.020> this<00:06:24.230> happened<00:06:24.560> since<00:06:24.710> nine<00:06:24.950> eleven<00:06:25.360> so

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
than this happened since nine eleven so

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.150 
than this happened since nine eleven so
it's<00:06:26.960> not<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:27.200> case<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.680> terrorists<00:06:28.040> in<00:06:28.130> the

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
it's not the case of terrorists in the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.120 
it's not the case of terrorists in the
past<00:06:28.400> have<00:06:28.610> been<00:06:28.640> unable<00:06:28.910> to<00:06:29.240> set<00:06:29.510> off<00:06:29.660> bombs

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
past have been unable to set off bombs

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.650 
past have been unable to set off bombs
but<00:06:31.130> it's<00:06:31.490> really<00:06:31.730> impressive<00:06:32.000> how<00:06:32.330> little

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
but it's really impressive how little

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.610 
but it's really impressive how little
bombing<00:06:33.260> has<00:06:33.350> taken<00:06:33.650> place<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:35.260> response<00:06:36.260> to

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
bombing has taken place the response to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.280 
bombing has taken place the response to
this<00:06:36.830> kind<00:06:37.040> of<00:06:37.190> event<00:06:37.310> that<00:06:37.930> these<00:06:38.930> things<00:06:39.110> are

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
this kind of event that these things are

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.940 
this kind of event that these things are
rare<00:06:39.560> and<00:06:40.360> we<00:06:41.360> probably<00:06:41.600> can't<00:06:41.960> prevent<00:06:42.740> all

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
rare and we probably can't prevent all

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.159 
rare and we probably can't prevent all
of<00:06:42.979> them<00:06:43.280> just<00:06:44.240> simply<00:06:44.810> isn't<00:06:44.960> very

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
of them just simply isn't very

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.090 
of them just simply isn't very
satisfying<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.919> for

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
satisfying and for

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.160 
satisfying and for
most<00:06:46.220> people<00:06:46.550> it's<00:06:46.730> for<00:06:47.450> a<00:06:47.480> lot<00:06:47.660> of<00:06:47.780> people<00:06:47.990> i

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
most people it's for a lot of people i

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.800 
most people it's for a lot of people i
should<00:06:48.350> say<00:06:48.500> it's<00:06:48.650> a<00:06:48.740> non-starter<00:06:49.780> yeah<00:06:50.780> I

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
should say it's a non-starter yeah I

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.090 
should say it's a non-starter yeah I
don't<00:06:51.140> I'm<00:06:51.290> not<00:06:51.320> sure<00:06:51.590> I<00:06:51.620> agree<00:06:51.770> with<00:06:51.950> that

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
don't I'm not sure I agree with that

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.610 
don't I'm not sure I agree with that
I've<00:06:52.880> been<00:06:53.210> saying<00:06:53.540> this<00:06:53.780> for<00:06:53.960> a<00:06:53.990> long<00:06:54.110> time<00:06:54.170> to

I've been saying this for a long time to

right as in the sensible and worrying

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
about things that are not great dangers

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.770 
about things that are not great dangers
is<00:07:16.400> foolish<00:07:16.850> when<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.240> have<00:07:17.360> to<00:07:17.480> worry<00:07:17.660> about

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
is foolish when you have to worry about

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.260 
is foolish when you have to worry about
things<00:07:18.020> that<00:07:18.140> are<00:07:18.350> great<00:07:18.620> dangers<00:07:19.040> and<00:07:19.280> people

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
things that are great dangers and people

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.670 
things that are great dangers and people
don't<00:07:20.360> necessarily<00:07:20.540> do<00:07:20.900> that<00:07:21.080> all<00:07:21.230> that<00:07:21.440> well

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
don't necessarily do that all that well

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.980 
don't necessarily do that all that well
but<00:07:22.340> they<00:07:22.460> certainly<00:07:22.670> understand<00:07:23.480> the<00:07:23.660> basic

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
but they certainly understand the basic

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.700 
but they certainly understand the basic
logic<00:07:24.200> of<00:07:24.560> that<00:07:25.120> so<00:07:26.120> you<00:07:27.080> know<00:07:27.170> when<00:07:27.350> mcnear

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
logic of that so you know when mcnear

Bloomberg<00:07:28.100> says<00:07:28.370> your<00:07:28.520> chance<00:07:28.700> of<00:07:28.790> being

Bloomberg says your chance of being

Bloomberg says your chance of being

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
killed is about the same as being like

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.220 
killed is about the same as being like
