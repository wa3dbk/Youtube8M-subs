00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.330
 channel of recycling and reuse 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 if it's the first time you're seeing me 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.220
 I invite you to subscribe to the channel and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.480
 so no video will be lost 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.449
 recycling today we are going to reuse fabric 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.300
 let's make some small brooches or 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.420
 ornaments that we can use to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.610
 adorn some clothes some bag a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.729
 jacket anything then we're going to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.620
 reuse fabric this is very easy 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:48.680
 then we will need 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.979
 scissors thread and needle a ballpoint pen for 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.530
 mark and something circular or round more 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.650
 or less about 4 or 5 centimeters of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.170
 diameter 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.760
 and this is all going to start well what 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.159
 first thing we're going to do is dial in 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.969
 the fabric 6 circles 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.110
 the round object that I have 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.100
 I have here a water cap 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.259
 from a boat 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.259
 and he dialed the 6 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 once we have marked the 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.960
 circles then let's cut them 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.580
 when we have cut the six 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.909
 circles let's start to welcome them 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.720
 with the needle and thread we bend the circle 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.720
 to the half 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:56.240
 and we started to make a position from 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:59.229
 is from the extreme to the other 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.229
 thus 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.320
 and it will be like that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.320
 we go 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.460
 Do the next without cutting the thread or 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.460
 nothing, we continue sewing the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.280
 next we equal to the middle of the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.830
 circle 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.910
 and we do the same again 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.910
 continuation of the first 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.530
 and we continue to do so until 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.530
 let's have five circles united 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.560
 once we have the five circles 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.560
 United 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.510
 let's join it to the first the last one 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.510
 First 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 we are going to adjust so that they are very 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.210
 pegaditos 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.630
 without cutting the thread we continue towards the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.630
 First 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.770
 then it is already forming with the flower 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.590
 that we want to form then here we go 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 to finish 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 always adjusting and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.200
 seeing that everything is very close 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.959
 and here we have the flower 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.299
 we leave this a moment aside and 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.180
 we take the last circle to this circle 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.459
 we're not going to fold it in half 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.519
 we're just going to pass the sewing 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.090
 simple all over the edge of the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.090
 circumference 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.099
 once we have done all the edge 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.099
 of the circumference we are going to adjust 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.870
 and to finish 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.549
 well once it's finished we 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.829
 it will stay like this and now let's sew this 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.750
 to the center of the flower that we just 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.930
 do 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.880
 that's why I have not cut the thread then 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.880
 now let's do it 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.330
 let's go hitting the flower 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.580
 and before finishing, we're going to 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.550
 verify that we look good then what 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.729
 what to do with the last circle 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.949
 that we just added is to open it 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.949
 to cover everything I had 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.880
 in the center of the flower and so they do not look 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.969
 seams or threads 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.879
 we are opening the circle 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:12.779
 and the flower with the 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.779
 capped center 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.280
 so now if what we do 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.280
 top here from behind 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.999
 if you are going to put it in some 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.849
 clothes or bag or whatever you want 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:31.619
 You can sew directly 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.619
 with this same thread 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.820
 and the flower is so good for me here 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.060
 I already have some that I had done 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.060
 previously 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.780
 is to see how well I have I 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.680
 made to put on this shirt that is 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.010
 white is smooth and I want to sew them here and 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 so I will give a new life to this 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.230
 shirt that's white and she's this 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.020
 Can do with many types of fabric 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.110
 Made with fabric of shirt that is fabric 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.630
 breathable I have also made with fabric 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.240
 jean like this that is also very 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.230
 it can be used to make rings 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.970
 necklaces good these flowers that are 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.970
 Applies practically as they can be 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.890
 use in many things and nothing I hope that 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.590
 you liked it in today's cycle 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.330
 I hope he does too and I hope to see 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.240

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.920
 make a hug and see you in the
