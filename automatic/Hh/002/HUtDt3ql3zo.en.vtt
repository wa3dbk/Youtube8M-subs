00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 Y 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.990
 Y 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 Y 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.060
 i 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 hello hello to create this makeup so 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.190
 intense and striking the first thing we're going 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.230
 to do is apply a shadow that is 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.210
 about two shades lighter than the tone of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 our skin and we are going to apply it as 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.620
 base on our entire eyelid from the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.030
 mobile eyelid to reach the area 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.030
 lower eyebrow 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.710
 next we are going to take our 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 120 color palette and we're going to take a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.240
 pretty intense blue color and we're going to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 start to apply in the area of 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.920
 basin of our eye with a brush that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 be flat if you have the area of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 the eye socket very small what 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.600
 can do is apply this color a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.970
 sightly above the exact basin 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.850
 that way when they open and close the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.090
 eyelid is going to look much better in the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.609
 area and the cut of the fold 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 after having applied our color what 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.200
 what we are going to do is blur it because 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.359
 we want to start shading a bit the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.979
 color that we have applied and we want 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.409
 start watering it so that it leaves 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.000
 blurring the best for 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.159
 to blur is to make movements 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.149
 circular or failing movements 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.149
 from back to front 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
 then let's take a color 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.299
 that is very similar to the shadow that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.069
 we used previously in this case 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.679
 I'm using a shadow that has 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.149
 certain little black dots so that 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.090
 make sure to use a shadow that 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.590
 have a little black color or can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.899
 use the same shadow they used 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.539
 above and take a little bit of 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.310
 black to darken the color of this 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.609
 way let's intensify a little more 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609
 of the look 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.330
 now let's take a black shadow 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.610
 mate and we will apply it only in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.670
 the outer area of ​​our eye creating 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.860
 the shape of a letter c we are going to 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.620
 apply it with a brush that is quite 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.260
 small so that the control of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 movement be exact in the place where 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.270
 we want it and that we are not going to 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.190
 scatter too much 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.790
 Now let's clean up any excess 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.950
 that we have applied with the blue shadow 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.120
 with a shade that is brown very appointment 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.130
 suavecita very subtle and that almost is not seen 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.130
 and I like to do this because many 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.770
 times when there is a very strong color that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.830
 transfers to a white color you see the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.330
 makeup not so polished if we put a 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.650
 brown color cited in the middle the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.599
 makeup will transition to much better 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.269
 it was time to delineate our 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.060
 eyes in this case I'm delineating my 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.340
 eyes with a cream eyeliner that 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.590
 this case seems to me that it works very 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.110
 well since it spreads very easily and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.329
 very fast and I will help create is 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.670
 delineated so beautiful that I want and 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.189
 also to create that tail or that little tail 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.870
 in the outer part of my eye but as 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.299
 I always say please feel free 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.030
 to use the products that you 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.060
 make them easy and use can be 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.019
 gel eyeliner cream eyeliner 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.019
 liquid terminator in short 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.570
 after having delineated our eyes and 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 be satisfied with our delineation 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.730
 what we are going to do is apply some 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.100
 How many layers of eye mask or mascara 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.690
 of eyes as you call it and for 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.250
 Of course, if you wish, you can apply 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.250
 false eyelashes 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.050
 then I'm going to clean up a bit the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.210
 lower area of my eye and for this I 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.240
 I will help with esteban stick of max 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.190
 factor that is basically a basis 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.960
 creamy with enough coverage that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.870
 many times I like to use it a lot 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.550
 more than a proofreader because he has very 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 very good coverage and it helps me 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.320
 Remove any type of eye ojera or redness 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.210
 or any type of dark color below 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.220
 of the eyes as you can see is 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.930
 better 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.600
 after having cleaned the part 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.040
 lower of my eyes I will continue 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.739
 this time applying the same shadow 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.000
 bluish that I used previously but 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.510
 now I am going to apply it in the part 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.310
 bottom of the eyelashes and below as 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.890
 you can observe I am helping myself with a 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.330
 brush flat again so as not to create 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.330
 a lot of shading in that area 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.199
 now let's move on to delineate the part 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.270
 lower to complete the look of the 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.060
 eyes and that the makeup looks a lot 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.830
 more dramatic in this case I am 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.800
 delineating also with the same 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.810
 gel or cream eyeliner that I used 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.610
 previously but if you are a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.189
 little allergic to this what can 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.680
 do is apply a pencil that is 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.110
 water proof that way the look is 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.650
 will be much better, more complete and 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.870
 it's going to look very feminine and very sexy 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.449
 let's finish our eyes with 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.389
 Pretty eye mask on the eyelashes 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.990
 inferiors and basically the eyes already 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.990
 they are ready 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.679
 let's move to the cheek area 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.289
 where are we going to give them just a little bit 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:22.969
 of color with a bronzer we are going to 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.849
 apply the bronzer in the area of 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.619
 cheekbones in the jaw area and a 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.589
 little touch in the area of ​​the 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:32.689
 sien that way we're going to see this skin 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:35.539
 that is going to feel like kissed by the 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.849
 sun and it's going to look much better we're going to 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.069
 emphasize our apples of the 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.619
 cheeks with a very soft pink color 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.330
 very pale very subtle that complements 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:46.779
 perfectly with the blue color of the 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.779
 shadow 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.870
 and after that we're going to move to 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.140
 area of the lips where we are going to 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.960
 delineate with a pencil that is a color 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.760
 Barbie rosita very soft and 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.010
 then let's apply a lip 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.680
 that is very similar to the color of the pencil 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.020
 that we have used to delineate the in 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.580
 this case I could not record the area the 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.590
 moment when I was putting on the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.150
 labial but in any case that I leave 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.460
 a photograph so you can see how 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.870
 you see the lips and that's all I hope 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.520
 that you liked the video many 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.520
 thank you for joining me goodbye 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.199
 Y 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.030
 finish
