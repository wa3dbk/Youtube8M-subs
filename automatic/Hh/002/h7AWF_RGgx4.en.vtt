00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.270 
the importance of not popping back up in
the<00:03:06.340> same<00:03:06.580> way<00:03:07.500> some<00:03:08.500> bunkers<00:03:08.890> are<00:03:09.040> even

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the same way some bunkers are even

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.920 
the same way some bunkers are even
shorter<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.030> you're<00:03:10.180> gonna<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.690> really

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
shorter so you're gonna have to really

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.170 
shorter so you're gonna have to really
eat<00:03:11.230> some<00:03:11.500> dirt<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.830> get<00:03:12.010> behind<00:03:12.159> them<00:03:12.459> so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
eat some dirt to get behind them so

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.759 
eat some dirt to get behind them so
completely<00:03:13.750> prone<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.230> you'll<00:03:14.379> see<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.739> I

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
completely prone and you'll see what I

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.960 
completely prone and you'll see what I
mean<00:03:17.760> okay

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
mean okay

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.430 
mean okay
so<00:03:19.209> you'll<00:03:19.360> need<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.599> get<00:03:19.720> super<00:03:20.110> low<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.319> the
