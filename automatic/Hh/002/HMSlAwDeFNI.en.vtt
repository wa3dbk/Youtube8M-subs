00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.810
 No 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 the compact review today a new video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.270
 to an unboxing of a notebook 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.510
 this is an acer aspire 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.650
 Laptop 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.860
 the exact model name would be acer 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.080
 aspire e15 171 g then we'll take a look 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.270
 let 's see what's on the packaging 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:50.880
 That's the front page 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.570
 On the one hand you can see the exact ones 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.329
 hardware if I have you one more time 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 make other side important so okay 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:16.369
 We want the packaging now 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.369
 not work out it does away from me 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:37.540
 now you can see it first 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.540
 synonymous the videos guide at the top 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.509
 Now we come to the lector but 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.130
 that kunz later on 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:06.710
 Let's see what else 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:11.030
 Here is something packed in foil 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.030
 Let's take a look 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:34.730
 here is the one part of the working device 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.730
 on a cable 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.379
 the other designates 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.810
 and now that 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 No 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.269
 out 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.130
 looks just like any other on 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.130
 charging cable 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:40.760
 and that too can not do otherwise now 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.459
 we look closely at notebook 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.459
 the nicely packed in a soft cloth 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.099
 so that a scratch can arise 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.540
 a 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:15.790
 So there are definitely times 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:15.790
 very cool is beautiful from plain 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.840
 so it looks from the side there is 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.380
 a hdmi connection 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.630
 a lan connection vga connection as well 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.000
 one usb connection and two connections 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.380
 each for microphone and headphones 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.710
 on the other side there are also 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:44.530
 again we have to finish the dvd 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.660
 player is still something to safety with it 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.110
 even with the display no scratches 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.110
 arise 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.670
 that looks like the laptop looks like mine 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.150
 opinion after nice out of here the 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.150
 surface 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.010
 So, as I said, let's take a look 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.010
 Now what's in the film in it 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.740
 a 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.550
 then separate a few things 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:51.410
 one has the smallest first after that 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:06:00.040
 Guide the windows 8 then if this 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:00.040
 Warranty and the travel guarantee 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.290
 that's already 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.680
 I have been using the laptop for a while now 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.080
 about a week and until now 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.110
 No problems occurred so the pc 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.289
 start down the value quickly and 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.789
 can also be as equally fast 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.430
 serve 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.370
 the only thing that struck me is that 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.330
 now and then at the so 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:34.110
 Internet speed, I slowly wlan 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.240
 and it happens from time to time that he is the 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.940
 sides slowly empties and also the 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.440
 download speed is not very 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.750
 high I have a 16,000 line 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.660
 my pc also gets the most out of it 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.400
 But I can come with the laptop 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.460
 not at full speed me 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.810
 do not know why that could be 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.160
 in any case works as others 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.810
 smoothly run smoothly 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.750
 Unfortunately I can not answer because 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.970
 I did not test it but the 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:07.740
 laptops definitely not to play 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:12.120
 well suited so i think you can 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.110
 some games playing a guitar the 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.770
 absolutely three I then already 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:20.870
 Internet read medium graphics 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:24.180
 play fluently but latest games 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:28.130
 high resolution before playing power 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.419
 still liquid which he does not pack 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.970
 I hope I liked the video
