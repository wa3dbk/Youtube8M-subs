right same okay so now my question do
you<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:36.509> liquids<00:01:37.020> are<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> same<00:01:37.939> or

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you think these liquids are the same or

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.620 
you think these liquids are the same or
the<00:01:39.210> liquids

use this kind of tool to determine what
students<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.459> prior<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:40.970> an<00:03:41.360> activity

and finally our tenth idea is to try to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.210 
and finally our tenth idea is to try to
build<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.519> some<00:03:49.730> ongoing<00:03:50.200> performance-based
