00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
number two though I'm going to get green

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.720 
number two though I'm going to get green
star<00:00:27.240> number<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.750> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.619> sort<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
star number one which is sort of in this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.210 
star number one which is sort of in this
first<00:00:30.000> area<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.690> have<00:00:30.810> two<00:00:31.050> areas<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.860> this

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
first area we have two areas of this

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.210 
first area we have two areas of this
level<00:00:32.600> this<00:00:33.600> area<00:00:34.020> involves<00:00:34.590> flying<00:00:34.770> around

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
level this area involves flying around

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.229 
level this area involves flying around
in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.699> other<00:00:36.000> area<00:00:36.449> in<00:00:36.809> all's<00:00:37.699> well<00:00:38.699> flying

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
in the other area in all's well flying

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.969 
in the other area in all's well flying
around<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.290> those<00:00:40.589> five

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
around but you have to get those five

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.450 
around but you have to get those five
silver<00:00:41.460> stars<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.269> right<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.460> we're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
silver stars right right right so we're

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
silver stars right right right so we're
going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.790> find<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> first<00:00:45.510> green<00:00:46.470> star<00:00:46.949> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
going to find the first green star in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to find the first green star in
this<00:00:47.250> area<00:00:47.640> without<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.600> silver<00:00:49.080> stars<00:00:51.620> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this area without any silver stars and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.390 
this area without any silver stars and
sticky<00:00:53.339> honey<00:00:53.519> comb<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.210> delicious<00:01:01.159> all<00:01:02.159> right

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so this is pretty simple just fly all

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.060 
so this is pretty simple just fly all
the<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.940> area<00:01:09.530> wick<00:01:10.530> sleep<00:01:10.770> climate

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the way to this area wick sleep climate

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.020 
the way to this area wick sleep climate
of<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> course<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.490> don't<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.940> to

of here and of course you don't want to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
of here and of course you don't want to
touch<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> water<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.100> touch<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
touch the water is it what touch the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.460 
touch the water is it what touch the
water<00:01:20.840> REO<00:01:21.840> can't<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.440> be<00:01:22.620> any<00:01:22.800> more<00:01:27.470> you'll

water REO can't be it be any more you'll

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
water REO can't be it be any more you'll
see<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.800> in<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.340> moment<00:01:29.730> i'm<00:01:29.910> pretty

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
see this in just a moment i'm pretty

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.970 
see this in just a moment i'm pretty
sure<00:01:30.390> i'll<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.750> hit<00:01:30.960> by<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.410> hot<00:01:31.590> air<00:01:31.740> while

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
sure i'll get hit by some hot air while

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.760 
sure i'll get hit by some hot air while
doing<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.550> challenge<00:01:33.230> where<00:01:34.230> we<00:01:34.440> have<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
doing this challenge where we have to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.179 
doing this challenge where we have to
publix<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.420> apply<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:37.560> bubbles

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.200 

there<00:01:45.189> we<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.630> whoops<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.399> when<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:48.729> land<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.119> a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
there we go whoops so when you land in a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.850 
there we go whoops so when you land in a
bubble<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.840> need<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.140> spin<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.799> then

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
bubble you just need to spin and then

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.690 
bubble you just need to spin and then
get<00:01:51.729> another<00:01:51.990> beam<00:01:52.990> mushroom<00:01:53.830> in<00:01:54.220> order<00:01:54.549> to

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
get another beam mushroom in order to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:09.059 
get another beam mushroom in order to
turn<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.509> be<00:01:55.690> Mario<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:08.500> don't<00:02:08.860> think

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
turn that in to be Mario I don't think

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.040 
turn that in to be Mario I don't think
they<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.220> continue<00:02:09.670> looks<00:02:10.119> like<00:02:10.330> i'll<00:02:10.509> just

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
they can continue looks like i'll just

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.150 
they can continue looks like i'll just
turn<00:02:11.350> back<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:11.980> Mario<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.130> need

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
turn back in to be Mario good we need

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.539 
turn back in to be Mario good we need
that<00:02:15.489> junk<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.239> guess<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.440> question<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.310> we

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
that junk I guess the question is to we

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.220 
that junk I guess the question is to we
are<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.630> be<00:02:21.060> okay<00:02:22.060> going<00:02:22.299> over<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> flying

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
are not to be okay going over the flying

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.970 
are not to be okay going over the flying
Gophers<00:02:23.620> thing<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> platform

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
Gophers thing and this is the platform

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.270 
Gophers thing and this is the platform
with<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.549> fluffy<00:02:28.209> block<00:02:28.590> or<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.860> fluffy

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
block no it's fluffy flaw and I don't

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.650 
block no it's fluffy flaw and I don't
see<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.299> green<00:02:34.630> star<00:02:34.870> anywhere
