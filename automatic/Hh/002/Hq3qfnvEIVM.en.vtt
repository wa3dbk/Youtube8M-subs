00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.040
 We are back to Kubinka, this time standing in front of us is IS-4 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.920
 Although the development of IS-4 began in November 1943, it did not begin production until 1946, which made it miss the war. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.320
 Its development philosophy was originally intended to take into account all the flaws and improvements of the IS-2 and incorporate captured enemy technology. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.440
 As a result, you do see something related to IS-2. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.000
 But you will also see some novel features that were not available in any other Soviet tank of that era. 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 We will explore this chariot in a consistent way, first and foremost, look at the suspension system. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.200
 After looking around, we look at the top engine deck, then move forward to the turret, then enter the interior. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 In this case, we can understand the overview of this chariot. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720
 You will notice that the first difference between it and the IS-2 is the oblique armor on the front of the car. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.960
 The front armor of the IS-2 is ladder-shaped and the driver's hatch is almost vertical, which is considered a weakness. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 Part of the design reference for the IS-4 is to ensure that the IS-4 can withstand the German 8.8 L/71 cannon. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.320
 So the designer made a single bevel armor and they added extra armor protection to the driver's cabin. 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.360
 And think that this is enough 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.360
 There are no other unusual features of the front armor, with standard maintenance lights and speakers. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 It is said that the two small plates between the tow hooks are maintenance marks. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.600
 Every time the tank is repaired and modified, people will post updates on the small tablet. 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.240
 The last thing I noticed is the spring loaded fender, in fact, if the fender is lifted 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.080
 They will be fixed in place, which seems to me a bit redundant, but it can be 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.040
 So, the fenders. The Soviet Union was a bit over-engineered 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.800
 You just need to loosen the latch here. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 The fender can be locked in place 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.960
 Why do they feel that it is necessary to let this special little thing sit comfortably on the chariot? I am not completely sure of this. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.200
 Have to say if I want to improve my life 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.080
 Spring-loaded fenders are probably not the first thing I thought of first. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.280
 There were no special surprises when I saw the mobile device. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.480
 Basically an IS-2, plus an extra set of heavy wheels, now it is seven pairs on each side 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.400
 Torsion bar 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.400
 It should be noted that, like other torsion bar vehicles, there are indeed buffers on it. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.040
 But unlike American vehicles, there are no shock absorbers and friction bumpers on it to prevent the torsion bar from swaying. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.200
 They only rely on the weight of the vehicle 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 The serial number is engraved on the wheel so that people can know their manufacturer 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 Lubrication method, in fact, the bolt on the top is broken, and people are also refueling: put the bolt back, and then leave 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.760
 Track tension, similar to other IS series vehicles, has a locking tab that kicks the locking tab 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.080
 Then use a large wrench to turn the screw forward or backward so that the idler extends forward or backward 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.720
 Track: Almost identical to other vehicles in the IS series, the only difference is: 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.440
 There is a central guide on each track link instead of the more common alternative 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.400
 Single pin track, held in place by a clip and several washers 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.360
 The last point to point out is that the side skirts are medieval-modified and were added in the 1950s and are different from IS-3. 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.240
 The side body is not tilted to one side, but a simple angular step 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.000
 There is absolutely no interesting place on the side of the chariot. 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.520
 Because it is necessary to leave room for the vehicle towing device installed here. 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.920
 Came to the rear of the chariot and it became interesting again. 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.720
 Each fender can accommodate two 90-litre cylindrical fuel tanks placed side by side 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.440
 These IS-4s are not connected to the fuel system, but are simply pumped or pumped into the internal fuel tank. 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.720
 The rear center position is the installation point of the MDH smoke machine 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.520
 I heard that MDH refers to the "Navy small smoke machine." Simple enough 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.640
 These smokers also have a quick separation device, and the driver only needs to pull a joystick if necessary. 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400
 Things will fall 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.720
 In front of it is a large transmission housing access 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.680
 It seems that if you want to open this access, you must remove many bolts. 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.680
 And this access cover is a large piece of metal that looks like two or three young people can open it. 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.160
 In my opinion, this is very inconvenient, I don't want to deal with it every day. 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.240
 The artillery march lock is of course used to lock the artillery. 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.280
 If you want to rotate the turret to the rear, you are ready to carry out rail transportation. 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.520
 Rotating the turret to the rear has two functions: first, this reduces the overhanging portion and thus the total length of the tank; 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.120
 Secondly, this can play a very good supporting role, which eliminates the overload of the lifting mechanism due to bumps or other conditions. 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.400
 Because they are already locked in place 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.080
 When we come to the rear, we can see the interval indicator light and the marker light. The rest is nothing. Let's go! 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.760
 On the left side of the tank, we can see the space with two storage boxes: no log 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.440
 The exhaust, one on each side, of course, may have been noticed as we circled the far side. Then we look up at the turret 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.120
 There are installation points for artillery repair equipment on the turret, and there are many handles for the warriors: 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.560
 The chariot soldiers are infantrymen who take tanks. When they fight, they will jump to the side and walk forward. 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.840
 We suspect that this is the dialogue system between the infantry commander and the chariot occupant. 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.320
 Because the chariot occupants are likely to have hanged 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.240
 This creates a problem: if it is very dangerous to fasten the chariot occupants 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.760
 Why do you have to ride outside the chariot? 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.720
 How is it, these are not for me, letâ€™s take a look at the next stop, the Engine Deck. 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.880
 When you stand on the engine deck, the obvious is the circular heat sink, which is the technique of their shameless stealing from Germany. 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 There is nothing to see outside. 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.880
 There is a central orifice for cooling here. 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.520
 There are two fuel tanks 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:41.080
 The left fuel tank has a capacity of 295 gallons, and the right fuel tank has a capacity of 115, a total of 410, which can walk about 170 kilometers. 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.240
 If you rotate the turret to one side, you will see an engine access port that can be lifted. 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.400
 When it is lifted, it will move to the side and you will see the top of the V12. 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.600
 Further on, the turret is engraved with casting marks and 12.7 mm Dshka for loading hands. 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.760
 It can easily reach a large elevation angle 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.920
 Front sight, optical sight 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.400
 It is said that the magazine has 60 rounds of ammunition.
