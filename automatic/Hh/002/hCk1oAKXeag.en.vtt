00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 today everyone needs to communicate because 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.469
 we often see the picture in which disk 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.330
 believe the company is going to youth 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.660
 sort of like all together really 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 each with their own personal iphone and something 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.369
 there is such a finger like this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.430
 communication takes place and the festival is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.820
 still there is a unifying beginning music 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.050
 songs in which any young man and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.320
 not really investing something like that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.980
 own personality 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 opinion of the world with which someone agrees 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 someone is not but listen to him and agree 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 singing in from here is born an experience 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.480
 it is human communication on such 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.329
 human soul sometimes even 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.420
 spiritual level that's great on level 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.920
 these modern rhythms of this clank 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.969
 era that there is a guitar with a belly and percussion 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.750
 install up 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.299
 with a mass of microphones then all this is very 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 fascinates gets her gives rise to communication 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.860
 not people at the end of the festival there and such and such 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.990
 good song strangers hug 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.530
 sing eyes burn it is great and that is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.880
 this is cultural communication and rock music 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 In this sense 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:38.040
 have some kind of distant since those times 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.100
 when she appeared she didnâ€™t come from her 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 not gone here this is uniting 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.960
 some kind of people power yes here are very many 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.509
 it is very important all bring down the union 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.500
 evil-level charge 2 there some 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 some political moments at the level 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.159
 lo love 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.759
 carders then love yes and love trust 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.330
 understanding that we are all human beings are very 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.000
 important and good youth comes on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.270
 the festival is so advanced after all 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 rock music now it can already be 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.780
 music is not for everyone 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 but she collects such enough 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 intellectual power in these times 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.709
 Yes, all the excess bounced Donat on 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.810
 other concerts go god forbid health 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.510
 but the festival goes on it's great 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:44.030
 This is what Vanya does when this 5000 came out 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:49.640
 people on a quiet sleeper Germany walked 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:55.200
 scared of all kinds of local thousand to sort 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.870
 screaming in Russian it was not bad but 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.970
 because they were peaceful people they were not 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.470
 were going somewhere to smash something they just 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.930
 they produced such a wonderful 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.450
 cultural hitting 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 the best sense of this evil it was 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.900
 OK 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.489
 type knows even in before the internship if 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.100
 may be more abruptly and your 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 that 's all right here is important 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.489
 peacefully 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.490
 he was 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.510
 Well, I was skeptical of ailments 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.010
 Well, this is how Vanya Dasha will burn out 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.760
 racks of people who helped 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:13.400

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:17.900

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.799

 I even discouraged adidas from saying 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.990
 where you need the festival is always a loss 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.710

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.860
 also did the festival myself I will not say that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.380
 they were right they were successful but I 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.180
 just I know how much it forces and shear 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.810
 it is worth nerves of timber and as a rule 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.370
 years of work just tighter guys 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:29.840
