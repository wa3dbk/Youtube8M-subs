00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.790
 so is today you guessed 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.340
 this is papaya papaya salad and 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.590
 we do not have a dad to face who we have 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.859
 of the plata and maybe your friends do not 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.480
 do not know what a papaya is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.640
 green even a green papaya 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.680
 So that's what a papaya that nothing the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.359
 end that you see nothing but our friends 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.220
 see the papaya 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.930
 I have to do with something I do not 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:43.840
 do not see yes exactly so 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 green papaya in salad well seen when the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 spicy 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.880
 ok friends we go for the salad of 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.470
 papaya the ingredients first so this 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.229
 what we need is pop in winter 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.220
 you go in this case I have a half 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.399
 papaya that I recalled in julienne 1 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.270
 so little thing do not use the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.780
 classic rap 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.700
 use a mandolin instead 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.250
 get that kind of julienne ok he we 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 will also need cherry tomatoes there are 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.240
 has a dozen cut in half 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.780
 we will quote to a clove of garlic 1 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.179
 chilli pepper 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.250
 so you 're using only one pepper 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:53.530
 because I do not really like it 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 too spicy a few yes a little bit of 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:03.399
 sugar from the fish sauce 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.660
 good glutamate we can not put in 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.489
 one and also shrimp paste 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.220
 you can not go back because 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.770
 it's true that it tastes so special 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.739
 in this case the tower is rather a 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.720
 recipe of what is simpler 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 after we can always add 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.849
 dried shrimps if you want crab 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.910
 salty if you want so for this recipe 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.680
 we will have to invent for those 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.069
 who do not have the healthiest job in 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.349
 makes an ax and chilli and binds 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.720
 together then put it all in one 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.550
 salad bowl makes ingredients and the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.840
 mix is ​​simply 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.450
 so we will use do not lie 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 and we see what that gives so I put 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:03:07.150
 bind the pepper that crushes everything then 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:13.030
 I add down fight the peanuts the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:16.140
 cherry tomatoes cut in half I'm going 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.819
 put some fish sauce 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.079
 no but you're not too much after you can 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.769
 always is right and if you put some 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.329
 too much it will be ruined I'll put a 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.890
 little bit of purpose to matt as I said 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.079
 just now the goal at matt this is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.079
 not obligatory it is as you want 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:38.319
 a little sugar always against swing 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.319
 the acidulous side with a little bit of 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:47.159
 sugar and I'll add this famous 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.749
 shrimp paste 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.840
 that too is optional for those who 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:56.200
 want it because it's not to taste 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:06.310
 of everyone so once I have 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:15.489
 do all that I crush the rate I was going 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:19.600
 forget the lime you put in 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:26.050
 about a quarter to start and 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.680
 after we readjust crushed all while 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:34.570
 one minute 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:36.700
 to taste is that it's a bad thing 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.200
 all so at the level of the season 'mans 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.639
 it's perfect for me 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.130
 so after you can always put 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.389
 a little sweet a little more tart 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.889
 or a little more salty 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:05:03.580
 It is as you want 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:05:09.520
 so for me it's done it feels very 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:23.229
 good and more I would say even feels very 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:28.240
 very good so here are friends the famous 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.840
 simple and effective papaya salad and 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.840
