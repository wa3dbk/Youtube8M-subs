play<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.609> them<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.390> people<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
play as them all the people that you

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.510 
play as them all the people that you
choose<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.530> different<00:01:49.829> personalities

choose from have different personalities

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
choose from have different personalities
they'll<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.179> have<00:01:51.390> different<00:01:51.600> stats<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
they'll also have different stats and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.349 
they'll also have different stats and
speed<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> stamina<00:01:52.920> however<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.909> never<00:01:53.999> really

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
speed and stamina however I never really

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.910 
speed and stamina however I never really
found<00:01:54.509> any<00:01:54.749> difference<00:01:55.109> between<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.619> sure

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
found any difference between them sure

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
found any difference between them sure
some<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> bit<00:01:56.700> faster<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.539> in<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
some of them are a bit faster but in a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
some of them are a bit faster but in a
game<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:57.990> deals<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.439> moving<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:58.979> purpose

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
game that deals with moving with purpose

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.669 
game that deals with moving with purpose
and<00:01:59.700> not<00:02:00.090> necessarily<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.840> speed<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
and not necessarily about speed the

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.319 
and not necessarily about speed the
differences<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.609> matter<00:02:02.759> there

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
differences really don't matter there

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
differences really don't matter there
are<00:02:03.359> three<00:02:03.630> difficulty<00:02:04.020> levels<00:02:04.200> easy

challenging and extreme easy is normally

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.410 
challenging and extreme easy is normally
just<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.100> regular<00:02:08.220> games<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> two

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just the regular games but with the two

just the regular games but with the two
other<00:02:09.600> difficulty<00:02:10.200> levels<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.740> usually<00:02:10.890> add

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
other difficulty levels they usually add

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
other difficulty levels they usually add
it<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.580> harder<00:02:11.880> game<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.660> added<00:02:12.990> more

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it in a harder game or just added more

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900 
it in a harder game or just added more
to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.410> regular<00:02:13.710> games<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.130> played<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
to the regular games you played now the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.090 
to the regular games you played now the
qualifier<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.540> wipeout<00:02:16.200> rounds<00:02:16.710> are<00:02:17.040> played

section<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.970> section<00:02:18.180> which<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> bit

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
section to section which was a bit

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.080 
section to section which was a bit
annoying<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.160> those<00:02:20.310> rounds<00:02:20.700> had<00:02:20.790> five

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
annoying see now those rounds had five

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.880 
annoying see now those rounds had five
sections<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.900> through<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.440> having<00:02:22.800> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
sections to go through and having to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
sections to go through and having to
wait<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.340> computers<00:02:23.760> turn<00:02:23.970> each<00:02:24.180> time<00:02:24.480> it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
wait for the computers turn each time it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.090 
wait for the computers turn each time it
would<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.140> been<00:02:25.230> more<00:02:25.380> fun<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:25.950> let

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
would have been more fun they just let

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.559 
would have been more fun they just let
you<00:02:26.130> play<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.460> whole<00:02:26.610> thing<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:27.420> let

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
you play the whole thing and then let

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.880 
you play the whole thing and then let
the<00:02:27.660> computer<00:02:28.050> players<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.500> their<00:02:28.620> try<00:02:28.830> at

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the computer players have their try at

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.080 
the computer players have their try at
it<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.280> mean<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.580> don't<00:02:29.700> wait<00:02:29.940> between

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it I mean they don't wait between

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.180 
it I mean they don't wait between
sections<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> TV<00:02:31.260> show<00:02:31.530> they<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:32.069> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
sections in the TV show they have the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.589 
sections in the TV show they have the
contestants<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.819> all<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> way<00:02:33.120> through<00:02:33.420> it

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
contestants go all the way through it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.410 
contestants go all the way through it
why<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
why not do that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
why not do that
the<00:02:34.480> game<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:34.810> well<00:02:35.349> now<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.770> skip<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
the game as well now you can skip the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.589 
the game as well now you can skip the
computers<00:02:36.490> turn<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.150> don't<00:02:37.390> have<00:02:37.450> to

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
computers turn so you don't have to

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.330 
computers turn so you don't have to
watch<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> don't<00:02:38.440> want<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.830> which<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
watch it if you don't want to which I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.800 
watch it if you don't want to which I
thought<00:02:39.489> was<00:02:39.640> really<00:02:39.849> cool<00:02:40.090> but<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.660> do

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
thought was really cool but if you do

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.360 
thought was really cool but if you do
choose<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.110> watch<00:02:41.440> them<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.250> other

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
choose to watch them you and the other

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.309 
choose to watch them you and the other
players<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.970> shoot<00:02:43.150> balls<00:02:43.420> at<00:02:43.660> them<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.080> trip

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
players can shoot balls at them to trip

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.020 
players can shoot balls at them to trip
them<00:02:44.440> up<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.980> was<00:02:45.099> really<00:02:45.340> fun<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.670> watch<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
them up it was really fun to watch the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.970 
them up it was really fun to watch the
players<00:02:46.239> wipeout<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.410> often<00:02:47.590> looked

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
players wipeout because it often looked

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.620 
players wipeout because it often looked
really<00:02:48.340> painful<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.090> controls<00:02:49.480> themselves

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
really painful the controls themselves

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.780 
really painful the controls themselves
were<00:02:50.050> simple<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.500> use<00:02:50.709> normally<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.550> was<00:02:51.610> just

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
were simple to use normally it was just

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.520 
were simple to use normally it was just
a<00:02:51.910> two<00:02:52.000> jump<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.600> use<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> nunchuck<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.350> move

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
a two jump and use the nunchuck to move

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.110 
a two jump and use the nunchuck to move
but<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> way<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> characters<00:02:54.670> moved<00:02:54.910> and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
but the way the characters moved and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.610 
but the way the characters moved and
controlled<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.690> screen<00:02:56.020> didn't<00:02:56.440> feel

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
controlled on the screen didn't feel

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.650 
controlled on the screen didn't feel
real<00:02:56.800> at<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.160> what's<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.880> person<00:02:58.030> fell<00:02:58.420> or<00:02:58.630> got

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
real at all what's a person fell or got

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.600 
real at all what's a person fell or got
hit<00:02:58.959> by<00:02:59.110> an<00:02:59.230> obstacle<00:02:59.590> they<00:03:00.069> would<00:03:00.220> go<00:03:00.370> limp

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
hit by an obstacle they would go limp

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.610 
hit by an obstacle they would go limp
and<00:03:01.000> would<00:03:01.209> flail<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.810> around<00:03:02.110> like<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.350> rag

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
and would flail all around like a rag

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.430 
and would flail all around like a rag
doll<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.400> was<00:03:03.519> ridiculously<00:03:04.150> unrealistic<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
doll it was ridiculously unrealistic the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.110 
doll it was ridiculously unrealistic the
wipeout<00:03:05.800> zone<00:03:06.040> was<00:03:06.250> definitely<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.730> harder

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
wipeout zone was definitely the harder

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.180 
wipeout zone was definitely the harder
of<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.300> obstacle<00:03:07.810> competitions<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.010> also

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
of the obstacle competitions but it also

over<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> barrel<00:03:14.080> or<00:03:14.470> jumping<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:14.950> trampolines

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
or avoiding things that would knock you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.199 
or avoiding things that would knock you
down<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.830> wasn't<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.310> creative<00:03:18.819> as<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.090> other

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
down it wasn't as creative as the other

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.330 
down it wasn't as creative as the other
games<00:03:19.569> which<00:03:19.959> was<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> shame<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.980> whole<00:03:21.130> game

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
games which was a shame the whole game

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.770 
games which was a shame the whole game
would<00:03:21.489> take<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:21.730> about<00:03:21.819> 20<00:03:22.239> minutes<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.540> play

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
would take you about 20 minutes to play

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.360 
would take you about 20 minutes to play
and<00:03:22.959> beat<00:03:23.140> when<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.650> finish<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.010> game<00:03:24.220> you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
and beat when you finish a game you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.309 
and beat when you finish a game you
unlock<00:03:24.489> new<00:03:24.910> characters<00:03:24.940> or<00:03:25.630> close<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.290> you

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
unlock new characters or close so you

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.170 
unlock new characters or close so you
can<00:03:26.410> replay<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.920> game<00:03:27.100> again<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.819> with<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> new

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
can replay the game again but with a new

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.150 
can replay the game again but with a new
option<00:03:28.660> or<00:03:28.780> character<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.590> there<00:03:29.769> is<00:03:29.920> some

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
option or character so there is some

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.190 
option or character so there is some
replay<00:03:30.549> factor<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.299> after<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.630> while<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:31.959> feels

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
replay factor but after a while it feels

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.809 
replay factor but after a while it feels
a<00:03:32.350> little<00:03:32.440> stale<00:03:32.830> because<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.489> games<00:03:33.670> don't

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
a little stale because the games don't

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.520 
a little stale because the games don't
really<00:03:34.060> change<00:03:34.299> much<00:03:34.630> even<00:03:34.840> at<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> harder

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
really change much even at the harder

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.350 
really change much even at the harder
difficulty<00:03:36.100> levels<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.700> there<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.000> also<00:03:37.239> a
