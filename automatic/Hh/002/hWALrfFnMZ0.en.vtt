00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.820 
there's actually a little more detail in
the<00:03:30.150> main<00:03:30.600> line<00:03:30.810> version<00:03:31.080> there's<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.680> lot<00:03:31.740> more

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
the main line version there's a lot more

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.040 
the main line version there's a lot more
pinstriping<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.820> lot<00:03:32.940> more<00:03:33.090> tampo<00:03:33.540> designs<00:03:33.900> i

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
pinstriping a lot more tampo designs i

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.630 
pinstriping a lot more tampo designs i
think<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.320> bodies<00:03:34.590> are<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.950> exact<00:03:35.220> same<00:03:37.640> but

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
think the bodies are the exact same but

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.090 
think the bodies are the exact same but
it's<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.360> tempo<00:03:39.750> details<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.410> there's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
it's all in the tempo details so there's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.230 
it's all in the tempo details so there's
a<00:03:41.160> little<00:03:41.340> more<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.959> original<00:03:44.060> main<00:03:45.060> line

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
a little more on the original main line

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.470 
a little more on the original main line

the<00:03:51.720> bat<00:03:51.990> Nicole<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> think<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.550> most

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
the bat Nicole I think this is the most

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.260 
the bat Nicole I think this is the most
desirable<00:03:54.240> of<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.110> collection<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.270> then

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
desirable of the collection and then

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.210 
desirable of the collection and then
