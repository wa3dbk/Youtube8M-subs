underneath<00:02:48.329> their<00:02:48.689> feet<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:49.260> as<00:02:49.439> if<00:02:49.590> they

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
underneath their feet just as if they

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.289 
underneath their feet just as if they
were<00:02:49.769> barefooted<00:02:50.459> but<00:02:50.669> of<00:02:50.790> course<00:02:51.030> they're

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
were barefooted but of course they're

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.479 
were barefooted but of course they're
protected<00:02:51.900> there's<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.169> really<00:02:53.010> amazing

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
protected there's a really amazing

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.460 
protected there's a really amazing
cushioning<00:02:53.939> that<00:02:54.120> comes<00:02:54.359> from<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.720> natural

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
cushioning that comes from this natural

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.000 
cushioning that comes from this natural
rubber<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:59.400> my<00:03:00.200> suggestion<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
rubber so that's my suggestion that of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.909 
rubber so that's my suggestion that of
the<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:03.299> best<00:03:03.540> thing<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.169> found<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.889> use

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
the the best thing that I found to use

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.089 
the the best thing that I found to use
but<00:03:05.569> I'm<00:03:06.569> sure<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.840> there<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.290> other

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
but I'm sure that there are other

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.959 
but I'm sure that there are other
possibilities<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:10.129> smudged<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.549> bit<00:03:11.730> on

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
possibilities I smudged a little bit on

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.770 
possibilities I smudged a little bit on
the<00:03:13.400> stamping<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.700> leather<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.359> put<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
the stamping of this leather so I put a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.550 
the stamping of this leather so I put a
little<00:03:15.989> bit<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.469> thumb<00:03:18.019> stitching<00:03:19.019> over<00:03:19.260> it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
little bit of thumb stitching over it

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.899 
little bit of thumb stitching over it
and<00:03:21.290> actually<00:03:22.290> people<00:03:23.159> have<00:03:23.400> said<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.729> they

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
and actually people have said that they

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.259 
and actually people have said that they
really<00:03:24.569> like<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:27.030> another

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
really like that so so it's another

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.300 
really like that so so it's another
example<00:03:27.479> of<00:03:27.959> ways<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.409> you<00:03:28.620> can<00:03:28.829> embellish

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
example of ways that you can embellish

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.800 
example of ways that you can embellish

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
along the top edge of it this it could

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.080 
along the top edge of it this it could
also<00:05:09.660> be<00:05:09.840> an<00:05:10.290> additional<00:05:10.950> color<00:05:11.160> that's<00:05:11.670> put

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
also be an additional color that's put

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.370 
also be an additional color that's put
on<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> pleather<00:05:12.570> that's<00:05:12.870> put<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.260> outside

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
on a pleather that's put on the outside

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.950 
on a pleather that's put on the outside
of<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.830> shoe<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.250> then<00:05:14.760> stitched<00:05:15.420> over<00:05:15.600> that

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
so there really is an opportunity to

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.960 
so there really is an opportunity to
have<00:05:19.590> lots<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.010> fun<00:05:20.220> with<00:05:21.710> color<00:05:22.710> and

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.110 
materials and then have a little heel
cap<00:05:27.090> back<00:05:27.330> here<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.860> gives<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.310> some<00:05:29.640> some

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
cap back here so that gives it some some

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.250 
cap back here so that gives it some some
added<00:05:30.600> support<00:05:30.780> and<00:05:32.450> then<00:05:33.450> this<00:05:33.600> is<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.080> boot

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
added support and then this is the boot
