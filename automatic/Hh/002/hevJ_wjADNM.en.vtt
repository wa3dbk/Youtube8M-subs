00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
not sure if you can see that let me see

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.790 
not sure if you can see that let me see
if<00:05:22.960> I<00:05:23.020> can<00:05:23.230> bring<00:05:23.800> this<00:05:24.010> up<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.250> little<00:05:24.520> bit<00:05:25.800> so

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
if I can bring this up a little bit so

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.100 
if I can bring this up a little bit so
there<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.700> go<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:28.030> can<00:05:28.420> see<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.870> they<00:05:29.080> have

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
there you go you can see that they have

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.860 
there you go you can see that they have
a<00:05:29.260> little<00:05:29.500> bit<00:05:29.620> darker<00:05:30.220> kind<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.090> do<00:05:31.300> your<00:05:31.570> look

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
a little bit darker kind of do your look

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800 
a little bit darker kind of do your look
on<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.170> foot<00:05:32.470> now<00:05:33.010> it<00:05:33.790> makes<00:05:34.120> sense<00:05:34.450> because

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
on the foot now it makes sense because

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.070 
on the foot now it makes sense because
you<00:05:35.410> know<00:05:35.500> when<00:05:36.010> you<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.790> don't<00:05:37.480> have<00:05:37.630> when

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
you know when you you don't have when

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.930 
you know when you you don't have when
you<00:05:38.170> walk<00:05:38.350> around<00:05:38.560> stuff<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.190> get<00:05:39.310> dirty<00:05:39.730> and

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
you walk around stuff you get dirty and

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.270 
you walk around stuff you get dirty and
so<00:05:40.750> that's<00:05:40.990> there<00:05:41.320> but<00:05:41.560> it's<00:05:41.770> too<00:05:42.070> close

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
so that's there but it's too close

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.310 
so that's there but it's too close
matching<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:43.810> color<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.110> the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
matching to the to the color of the

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.520 
matching to the to the color of the
throne<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:44.920> it's<00:05:45.850> it<00:05:46.300> just<00:05:46.330> kind<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:46.990> throws

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
throne so it's it just kind of throws

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740 
throne so it's it just kind of throws
people<00:05:47.770> off<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.190> little<00:05:48.610> bit<00:05:48.730> but<00:05:48.970> for<00:05:49.540> me<00:05:49.660> it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
people off a little bit but for me it

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.020 
people off a little bit but for me it
doesn't<00:05:49.780> matter

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
doesn't matter

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.029 
doesn't matter
while<00:05:52.030> I<00:05:52.060> paint<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.539> while<00:05:52.720> i<00:05:52.750> repaint<00:05:53.259> this<00:05:53.440> I

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
while I paint it while i repaint this I

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.860 
while I paint it while i repaint this I
don't<00:05:54.610> think<00:05:54.850> so<00:05:55.060> I<00:05:55.090> think<00:05:55.150> they<00:05:55.449> did<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:55.660> good

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
don't think so I think they did a good

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.390 
don't think so I think they did a good
