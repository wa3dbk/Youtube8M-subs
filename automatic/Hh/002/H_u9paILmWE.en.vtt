00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this is for no space and this means you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.390 
this is for no space and this means you
have<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.950> add<00:02:08.099> space<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.590> respect<00:02:11.009> time

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
have to add space so with respect time

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.420 
have to add space so with respect time
in<00:02:11.520> seconds<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:13.650> example<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:14.099> what<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
in seconds so for example this what it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.740 
in seconds so for example this what it
is<00:02:14.549> command<00:02:15.200> potions<00:02:16.939> which<00:02:17.939> one<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.239> your

is command potions which one is your
rinse<00:02:19.040> last<00:02:20.040> 10<00:02:20.400> second<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> degree<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.450> 2

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
rinse last 10 second and the degree is 2

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.180 
rinse last 10 second and the degree is 2
