I have here is a alignment rod for a
stick<00:00:20.140> for<00:00:20.500> golf<00:00:20.740> but<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.609> could<00:00:21.760> use<00:00:21.880> a

stick for golf but you could use a

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.320 
stick for golf but you could use a

for and trying to maintain throughout

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.410 
for and trying to maintain throughout
your<00:00:38.500> jumping<00:00:38.949> that's<00:00:39.309> going<00:00:39.580> to<00:00:39.640> provide

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
your jumping that's going to provide

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.939 
your jumping that's going to provide

more consistency while you're jumping
and<00:00:42.610> where<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.910> Rope<00:00:43.059> is<00:00:43.210> traveling<00:00:43.600> over<00:00:43.839> and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
and where the Rope is traveling over and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.410 
and where the Rope is traveling over and
under<00:00:44.170> your<00:00:44.320> body<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.970> get<00:00:45.970> rid<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.150> a<00:00:46.269> lot<00:00:46.360> of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
under your body and get rid of a lot of

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
under your body and get rid of a lot of
the<00:00:46.540> Miss<00:00:46.839> skips

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.819 

with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> success<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.079> our<00:00:52.230> movement<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.769> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
with the success of our movement what I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
with the success of our movement what I
see<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.160> people<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.699> their<00:00:54.480> rotational

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
see with people is their rotational

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
see with people is their rotational
access<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.129> tends<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> from<00:00:57.149> their

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
access it tends to be from their

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.079 
access it tends to be from their
shoulders<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> elbows<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.159> that<00:00:59.550> generates

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
shoulders and elbows and that generates

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.240 
shoulders and elbows and that generates
big<00:01:00.359> circles<00:01:00.839> with<00:01:00.899> their<00:01:01.140> arms<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.559> slows

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
big circles with their arms and slows

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.950 
big circles with their arms and slows
down<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> lose<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.969> lot<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> power<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.750> their

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
down and lose a lot of power in their

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.139 
down and lose a lot of power in their
rotation<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.649> rope<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
rotation of the rope so what you want to

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.240 
rotation of the rope so what you want to
focus<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.500> getting<00:01:07.680> nice<00:01:07.920> small

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
focus on is just getting nice small

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.889 
focus on is just getting nice small
circles<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.759> just<00:01:08.940> utilizing<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.570> wrist<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
circles and just utilizing your wrist to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.740 
circles and just utilizing your wrist to
turn<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.289> Rope<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> practice<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> by

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
turn the Rope you can practice that by

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
turn the Rope you can practice that by
either<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.140> putting<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.470> ropes<00:01:13.710> both

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
either just putting the ropes both

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
either just putting the ropes both
handles<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:14.970> hand<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> give<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
handles in one hand just kind of give it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
handles in one hand just kind of give it
a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.289> swing<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.039> but<00:01:17.580> then

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
a little swing to get it going but then

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.630 
a little swing to get it going but then
just<00:01:17.909> work<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.270> getting<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.520> keeping<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just work on getting that keeping it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.219 
just work on getting that keeping it
going<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.600> wrist<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> don't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
going just with your wrist you don't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.690 
going just with your wrist you don't
have<00:01:22.350> any<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.740> movement<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
have any more movement but it's just

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
have any more movement but it's just
calling<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.869> maybe<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.530> both

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
calling it then maybe do that with both

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.310 
calling it then maybe do that with both
sides

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.650 

so<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.980> do<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.160> is<00:01:32.340> just

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
so what I want to do now is just

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.500 
so what I want to do now is just
demonstrate<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.810> form<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:35.210> maintaining<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
demonstrate the form of maintaining that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.730 
demonstrate the form of maintaining that
like<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.870> holding<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> rule<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.500> guy's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
like you're holding the rule that guy's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.110 
like you're holding the rule that guy's
holding<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.100> rod<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> stay<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
holding the rod I want to stay in that

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.380 
holding the rod I want to stay in that
position<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.440> move<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.770> rope<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.100> my

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
position and just move the rope with my

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.000 
position and just move the rope with my
wrists<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.510> maintaining<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.590> while<00:01:43.860> I'm

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
wrists and maintaining that while I'm

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.770 
wrists and maintaining that while I'm
jumping<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> should

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
jumping and so this is what it should

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:59.020
