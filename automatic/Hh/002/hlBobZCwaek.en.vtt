00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all then in today's mini vi 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 I show how I did this trick 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 lately I'm experimenting with 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 tricks that embrace a lot of tonality 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 warmer than usual 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 in fact much warmer because I am 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.210
 I usually do n't use color colors 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 very hot I prefer by far 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 the cold ones only I learned 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 I was a few days at the seaside I have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.900
 took a bit of color and then precisely 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.929
 is trying to make up with me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.399
 I don't know how many a bit warmer shades 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.980
 sometimes called hot 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.500
 so far, however, we have understood each other 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.840
 so i'm also using all the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.809
 shades of bronze and antique pink 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.910
 of the very warm brown that usually 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.910
 in fact I never use the list of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 products used sail veils I write 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 as usual in the information box where 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.140
 you will find all the information 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.870
 regarding the meeting that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.239
 I'm organizing with the girls 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.809
 abruzzesi but with whomever he wants 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.090
 then how come I told you that you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760
 I already anticipated in the last video yes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.710
 will definitely be in pescara for sure 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 in the center maybe we do just one 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 walk for a shopping trip 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 I was thinking about 15 or 16 July 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.540
 because many girls have me 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.610
 they asked to organize it 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.260
 around that date so do me 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 know yourself again 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.800
 it can be good as a date 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.800
 provisional then in the next ones 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.410
 days I let you know if the date 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.990
 actually 15 or 16 in short 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.360
 coming days I will be much more precise and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.330
 nothing i hope the 3d i like it is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.850
 a very simple and fast 3d gate 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.850
 I'll just speed up with with the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.910
 music because I don't speak and therefore nothing 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 see you Friday with the video I don't know 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.920
 what video I will do anyway I'll see you 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.050
 Friday and thanks for listening to me at 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 so far, thanks to the video and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.100
 see you soon. Bye
