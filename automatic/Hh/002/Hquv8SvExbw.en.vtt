00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
thought that was actually pretty neat

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.119 
thought that was actually pretty neat
there's<00:03:22.420> also<00:03:22.659> a<00:03:22.780> sponsorship<00:03:23.409> thing<00:03:23.980> where

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129

you can put a bunch of ads all over your
car<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.230> unlock<00:03:27.069> throughout<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.700> game

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
car that you unlock throughout the game

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.550 
car that you unlock throughout the game
and<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.269> they<00:03:28.450> help<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.930> increase<00:03:29.260> your

and then they help you increase your
earnings<00:03:29.890> depending<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.549> what<00:03:30.760> ads<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.150> have

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.420 

another<00:03:39.140> thing<00:03:39.440> you'll<00:03:39.620> get<00:03:39.770> in<00:03:39.980> grid<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.400> a

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
another thing you'll get in grid is a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:54.960 
another thing you'll get in grid is a
pseudo<00:03:40.970> 24<00:03:41.540> Hours<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:41.960> LeMans<00:03:42.530> race

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.670 

and<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.480> thought<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.840> he<00:03:55.870> tracked<00:03:56.230> for<00:03:56.470> that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
and I thought that he tracked for that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.380 
and I thought that he tracked for that
was<00:03:56.890> very<00:03:57.070> well<00:03:57.280> designed<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:57.970> game<00:03:58.180> and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
was very well designed in this game and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.850 
was very well designed in this game and
a<00:03:58.450> lot<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.690> fun<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.990> play<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.290> reminded<00:03:59.680> me<00:03:59.770> of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
a lot of fun to play it reminded me of

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.340 
a lot of fun to play it reminded me of
test-drive<00:04:00.430> LeMans<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.300> game<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.630> played<00:04:02.170> for

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350

the<00:04:02.380> Dreamcast<00:04:02.920> quite<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.310> bit<00:04:03.780> opinions<00:04:04.780> will

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
the Dreamcast quite a bit opinions will

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.600 
the Dreamcast quite a bit opinions will
vary<00:04:05.200> on<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.710> but<00:04:05.890> where<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> think<00:04:06.160> grit

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
vary on this but where I think grit

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.760 
vary on this but where I think grit
comes<00:04:06.850> up<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.360> short<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> lack
