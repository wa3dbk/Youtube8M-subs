shaft not below like this when you put
it<00:01:17.130> below<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.330> unscrew<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:19.140> there

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
it below you just unscrew it right there

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
it below you just unscrew it right there
and<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:20.880> careful<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> pull<00:01:21.780> the

and be very careful when you pull the
wire<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.369> going

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
wire out just a little or you're going

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
wire out just a little or you're going

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to pull it all out but basically just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
to pull it all out but basically just
unscrew<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> turn<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> point<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> down

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
unscrew that turn it to point it down

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.580 
unscrew that turn it to point it down
tuck<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.759> back<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:31.350> your

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
tuck it back up and then on your

tuck it back up and then on your
controller<00:01:32.159> here

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640

push down go forward okay

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.710 
push down go forward okay
pretty<00:01:48.470> simple<00:01:49.000> doesn't<00:01:50.000> take<00:01:50.119> any<00:01:50.360> getting

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
pretty simple doesn't take any getting

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.050 
pretty simple doesn't take any getting
used<00:01:50.930> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
used to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.090 
used to
okay<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:53.720> one<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.200> first<00:01:54.410> mods<00:01:54.830> it

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
okay that was one of the first mods it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.070 
okay that was one of the first mods it
you<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.850> reason<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.119> want<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.390> do<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:56.960> it

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
you the reason you want to do that is it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.980 
you the reason you want to do that is it
increases<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.920> speed<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.780> pretty

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
increases the speed and this is a pretty

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.560 
increases the speed and this is a pretty
slow<00:02:00.290> helicopter<00:02:01.100> indoors<00:02:01.909> which<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.330> great

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
slow helicopter indoors which is great

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.420 
slow helicopter indoors which is great
for<00:02:02.780> beginners<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:03.409> once<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.070> reach<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
for beginners but once you reach the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.370 
for beginners but once you reach the
point<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.790> want<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.030> get<00:02:05.119> more<00:02:05.330> speed<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.200> do

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
point you want to get more speed you do

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.990 
point you want to get more speed you do
that<00:02:06.710> now<00:02:08.170> I've<00:02:09.170> also<00:02:09.320> done<00:02:09.649> no<00:02:10.070> belt<00:02:10.340> or<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> lot

that now I've also done no belt or a lot

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.350 
that now I've also done no belt or a lot
to<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> body<00:02:12.170> because<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.489> have<00:02:13.640> crashed<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
to the body because I have crashed this

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.630 
to the body because I have crashed this
helicopter<00:02:14.900> under<00:02:15.769> times<00:02:17.980> more<00:02:18.980> tonight<00:02:19.190> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
helicopter under times more tonight you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.280 
helicopter under times more tonight you
know<00:02:19.790> hundreds<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.510> times<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.260> still

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
know hundreds of times and it still

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.560 
know hundreds of times and it still
keeps<00:02:21.860> ticking<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.970> has<00:02:23.180> no<00:02:23.480> reverse<00:02:23.959> long<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
keeps ticking it has no reverse long the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.810 
keeps ticking it has no reverse long the
ordering<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.630> new<00:02:26.660> motor<00:02:27.050> because<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.430> won't<00:02:28.670> go

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
ordering a new motor because it won't go

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.600 
ordering a new motor because it won't go
in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> reverse<00:02:29.330> right<00:02:29.600> now<00:02:29.810> okay<00:02:30.470> so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
in the reverse right now okay so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.780 
in the reverse right now okay so
basically<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:33.430> velcro<00:02:34.430> mod<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.769> reason<00:02:37.670> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
basically the velcro mod is the reason I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840 
basically the velcro mod is the reason I
did<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.690> two<00:02:38.930> top<00:02:39.860> bolts<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:40.549> where

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
did it is the two top bolts here where

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.660 
did it is the two top bolts here where
the<00:02:41.030> screws<00:02:41.390> go<00:02:41.660> into<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.200> body<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:43.549> know

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
the screws go into the body you know

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.370 
the screws go into the body you know
like<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.000> say<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.180> crash<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.930> quite<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.140> bit

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
like I say I crash this one quite a bit

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.650 
like I say I crash this one quite a bit
this<00:02:45.530> was<00:02:45.709> my<00:02:45.920> first<00:02:46.160> heli<00:02:46.730> ever<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
this was my first heli ever and I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.560 
this was my first heli ever and I
learned<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.329> plastic

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
learned on this one but the plastic

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.319 
learned on this one but the plastic
mounts<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.320> both<00:02:51.560> sides<00:02:51.890> broke<00:02:52.730> off<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
mounts on both sides broke off on a

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.900 
mounts on both sides broke off on a
pretty<00:02:53.810> serious<00:02:54.079> crash<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> had<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.579> find<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
pretty serious crash so I had to find a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.449 
pretty serious crash so I had to find a
way<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> connect<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> body<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.950> did<00:02:58.100> was

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
way to connect the body so all I did was

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.120 
way to connect the body so all I did was
cut<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.030> little<00:02:59.239> square<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.750> velcro<00:03:00.620> right

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
cut a little square of velcro right

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.420

ready<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:25.020> fly<00:05:25.260> when<00:05:25.620> both<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:26.040> these

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
ready to fly when both of these

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.460 
ready to fly when both of these
batteries<00:05:26.510> are<00:05:27.510> fully<00:05:27.720> charged

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
flying okay so I'll show you how to do

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.180 
flying okay so I'll show you how to do
these<00:06:57.750> in<00:06:57.960> another<00:06:58.230> video<00:06:58.590> but<00:06:58.860> I'm<00:06:58.980> just

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
these in another video but I'm just

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.000 
these in another video but I'm just
explaining<00:06:59.610> what<00:07:00.000> I<00:07:00.030> did<00:07:00.420> to<00:07:00.600> that<00:07:00.630> one<00:07:01.020> to<00:07:01.800> get

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
explaining what I did to that one to get

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.760 
explaining what I did to that one to get
faster<00:07:03.000> flight<00:07:03.330> and<00:07:03.600> longer<00:07:04.110> battery<00:07:04.350> time

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
faster flight and longer battery time

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.690 
faster flight and longer battery time
so<00:07:08.060> that's<00:07:09.060> about<00:07:09.510> it<00:07:09.990> for<00:07:10.260> this<00:07:10.590> mod<00:07:11.010> when<00:07:11.670> I

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
so that's about it for this mod when I

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.530 
so that's about it for this mod when I
get<00:07:12.000> a<00:07:12.030> new<00:07:12.270> one<00:07:12.570> in<00:07:13.290> stock<00:07:13.740> I'm<00:07:14.190> going<00:07:14.610> to<00:07:14.850> just

get a new one in stock I'm going to just
on<00:07:15.750> the<00:07:15.930> seam<00:07:16.230> is<00:07:16.500> 107<00:07:16.980> not<00:07:17.280> to<00:07:17.490> see<00:07:17.760> the<00:07:18.030> camera

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
on the seam is 107 not to see the camera

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.140 
on the seam is 107 not to see the camera
model<00:07:19.080> I'll<00:07:19.530> go<00:07:19.770> ahead<00:07:19.890> and<00:07:20.130> show<00:07:20.310> you<00:07:20.370> how<00:07:20.850> to
