00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:11.910
 In a project 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.919
 borges but during 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.349
 five years ago the bravas 40 years has given concrete form 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.079
 in fact the architect of the new norm 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.380
 in October they have to start and at this time physical 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 It benefits all Peru is important 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 our people have to see clear benefit for integration like these 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 binational projects and secret brian custom for its magnitude bp for its 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.700
 symbolism 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.910
 it is extremely 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.370
 important 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.980
 in europe lose a single second of time to make it a reality 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.920
 puyango-tumbes project 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.050
 it has an importance 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.220
 historical 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.660
 and symbolic 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.710
 as transcendental as its agricultural impact 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.199
 both on the Ecuadorian side and the Peruvian side 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.540
 something 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.910
 bellizia 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 for this extension of the agricultural frontier I'm sure 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.190
 a jury will declare work 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 to many thousands 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 of peasants and worker 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.010
 first 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.190
 quito is very different latin america has these problems it comes in this 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.590
 forum 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.630
 and who does not the resolution say 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 the court has been shot down by all parties 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.170
 involve 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 the court does not pay notified the poor volunteer 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.030
 if this happens when it is not like that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.050
 clearly part of the Peruvian government has been mentioned that does not exist 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.790
 boundary problem 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
 neither maritime nor territorial with ecuador fourth - we practice 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.670
 maybe it would be desirable that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.980
 that deficit March 1 in writing 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.180
 felton cases those steps on the moon 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.650
 we meet with need 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.650
 that notification 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 this has been a hard process 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 we hope to proceed 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.659
 since December 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:09.999
 to have 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.729
 completed the day 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.549
 have completed the renegotiation of contracts 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.059
 in case some transnational 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.859
 unwilling 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.119
 so this one 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.529
 there are no policies 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.249
 the national government finally eclectic a great representativeness 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.179
 democratic 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.229
 good prepare investment and that you go nice 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.709
 but we do not have state resources through the sale of 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.499
 assumption 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:36.919
 from politics 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.929
 a sovereign state as an Ecuadorian spectator 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.759
 we see a clear economic recovery 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.229
 the rate seems to take out 13 6 points 5 6 dark spots currently 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
 In any case, we believe that the non-oil sector w 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.079
 in the oil sector precisely because of this renegotiation 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.769
 this age 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.640
 falling in English the production of derivatives to the commerce 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.689
 at that time 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.499
 we sign transit contract 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.699
 and despite having lower private oil production that has already marked 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.689
 so what's the use 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.949
 I got cheaper 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.279
 they are taking less but there is no more 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.349
 the best in the world of landscapes cow narvaja and that we hope that the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.859
 next year all of us in principle believe that the non-oil sector is going to 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.859
 get you to believe 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.569
 in the background of the ideas to grow after sheen lost a lot 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.969
 and the joint effort with Peru 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:48.039
 we are Pitana international bridge has advanced that cited sources cited 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.679
 the very people who live on the border 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.679
 as 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.469
 also proposes 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.549
 he does not do anything 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.749
 unit 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.730
 hence the multinational so that together both countries continue with 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:05.789
 that process 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.109
 - analyze 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.409
 and if they will continue to be an agreement 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.159
 bi-national palm volleyball 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.989
 antioco pendant next to brazil to repair it required 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.090
 the copeco 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.340
 both of them
