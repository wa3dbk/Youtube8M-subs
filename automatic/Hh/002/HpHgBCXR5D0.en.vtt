00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 

so<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.960> going<00:01:29.109> to<00:01:29.200> be<00:01:29.289> sort<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.649> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
so this is going to be sort of a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.469

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.100 

let<00:01:42.670> me<00:01:42.730> just<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.090> keep<00:01:43.300> now<00:01:43.600> I'm<00:01:43.780> sort<00:01:44.050> of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
let me just I keep now I'm sort of

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.560 
let me just I keep now I'm sort of
taking<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.560> from<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.800> back<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.570> underneath

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
taking it from the back and underneath

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.930 
taking it from the back and underneath
because<00:01:47.260> then<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.220> really<00:01:48.460> going<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> loop

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
because then it's really going to loop

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.800 
because then it's really going to loop
around<00:01:50.730> it'll<00:01:51.730> really<00:01:51.850> move<00:01:52.150> around<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.630> real

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
around it'll really move around it real

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.690 
around it'll really move around it real
nice<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.830> that's<00:01:54.010> why<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.190> want<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.400> take<00:01:54.550> it

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.520
