00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 hello to all my children how are you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.140
 today the vegan cat and in this video os 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.140
 I'm going to show you how to make this scraper 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 for cats in a homemade way 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 totally economical and very easy first 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.369
 that we are going to use this we are going to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 recycle a lamp foot that also 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.370
 it can be something else that is very 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 heavy basically so that cats do not 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.290
 they raise it pita rope or raffia I think 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.630
 which is also called a gun 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.810
 hot silicone or something like that 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.650
 to scratch the first thing I'm going to do 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.649
 is scratching since this is like 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.920
 painted enamel I checked that no 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.430
 the silicone sticked very well but at 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430
 do what 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.790
 so scratch the areas so that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.869
 the silicone would come out better and then 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.420
 lift up so easily 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.840
 good clean well after all 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.479
 chips that have remained of paint and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 we take the hot silicone gun 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.430
 we are throwing the silicone we are going to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 start at the center is worth casting a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.399
 generous amount because you have to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.940
 stick the rope since it dries 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.270
 Let's go sticking silicone you go 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.509
 justito the edge is worth it to stop 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 that we stay well tense and here in the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.450
 first round, we are going to give you a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 I also dot more silicone so that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 do not move because at the beginning you have to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.149
 hold it well 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 at the beginning of having patience because 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.159
 until it stays well pegadito and everything 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 that may cost a little and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.700
 squeezing it enough because the question 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.320
 is that they have to stay pretty 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.220
 tense for 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 the cats can be scratched and not 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.860
 complain like me that I've already burned a 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.570
 lots of times if you do not have a gun 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 It is not necessary that the purchase and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.800
 be put you can use some other 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.860
 glue like some other kind of glue 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.490
 white tail or something like that when 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.390
 in fact it is unscrewing the helmet this 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.150
 let's say the table and I have taken iron 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.700
 of these that are good in this case 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 in a refrigerator that broke down and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.430
 I kept these rods among others 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.730
 drawers of other things well this is a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.280
 rod that makes the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.560
 bottles or move away if they serve you 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.900
 orientation is where it is at the door 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.390
 it does not stick the bottles 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.329
 so what I've done is dismantle it for 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 to be able to put the best is worth that is the basis 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.079
 of the lamp and how this has a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.290
 good way if you have some kind of 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.360
 radial or something style you can cut it 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.900
 but well I'm going to take advantage of that 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.790
 stay here I would fit stuck the tube 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 at the base the truth that I 'm 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.060
 making very hot silicone fan 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.700
 often danger is already stuck all wrong and 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.019
 a whole package is already made and with the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 silicone the truth is that it has been 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.530
 ocejo and super well I have also tried 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.269
 that the one where the iron enters stays 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.829
 totally covered in silicone so that 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.540
 will not move because otherwise when 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.670
 cats could play as they can 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.439
 take it out and that's what it looks like from the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.400
 another side is worth as you see although it makes a 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.010
 a few minutes that has begun to dry 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.780
 if I give the rod it has dried 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.090
 pretty good so this is going to 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.110
 stay here already fixed forever 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.960
 no problem 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.720
 we needed to put something in the good tip 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.680
 I have chosen these strings that are 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.900
 plastic and it 's all 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.819
 Plastic things are also worth 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.489
 series tied really are like pacifiers 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.340
 or something like that I have it done pretty 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.699
 time and what I'm going to do is play it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.600
 it's worth it so that it stays fixed 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.270
 here 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.540
 but you can use some other string 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.270
 with a pompom with a rattle with what 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.140
 be and finally what I have done is 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.560
 put some bells on the tip worth 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.930
 once it is sealed everything ends and with a 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.860
 little bit of silicone so that 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.460
 still more fixed and it's just missing 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.980
 put it on the cats and have them do it 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.870
 clear case and good guys if you have 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.000

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.790
