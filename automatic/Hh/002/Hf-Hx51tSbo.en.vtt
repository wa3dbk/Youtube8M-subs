00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.360
 what I read to you is an excerpt from 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.950
 poems 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.990

 Well yes, and I kept my promise 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.690
 I thought it was all about autumn as I came up 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.610
 sound but i really love autumn not 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.910
 in the autumn forest, I like to walk 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.620
 just admire the colorful leaves 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:12.610
 the poet about all this beauty can 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:16.209
 say much better than us with you this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.380

 wrote Pushkin and Lermontov 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.080
 in general it seems to me that any good 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.330
 the poet will certainly find some 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.989

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.560

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.220

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.410
 poets 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.510
 that's just in this poem 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.640
 there are perhaps not quite familiar 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.019
 old words can be said for you 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.049

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.880

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.550
 there is in the autumn the original is short but 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.310
 wonderful time 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.580
 the whole forest is like crystal and 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.400
 radiant evenings 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.690
 where the jovial sickle was walking and the spike fell 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.020
 now you have everything everywhere 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.860
 only cobwebs thin hair glistens on 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.849

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.139
 empty air no hear no pain but 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:54.990

00:04:51.139 --> 00:05:00.030
