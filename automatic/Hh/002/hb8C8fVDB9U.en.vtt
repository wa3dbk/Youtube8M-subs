00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
that I think everybody should take to

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
that I think everybody should take to
heart<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.340> if<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.760> don't<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
heart and that is if you don't have a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.020 
heart and that is if you don't have a
safe<00:00:09.570> place<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:10.469> shelter<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.400> case<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.969> a
