00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.900
 the southernmost forests of the world the new zealand and islands 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.900
 subantarctic 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.329
 the six boys located about 200 km south of New Zealand to 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.539
 near the Antarctic 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.900
 the southern forests are found here protected by the mild climate in 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 because of the warm currents flowing through the area 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.559
 the trees are crooked and curved because they are violent 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.420
 the isie with a hostile environment and steep cliffs are now 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 inhabited by many strange creatures 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 this is a sea lion from new zealand 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 he walks slowly through the forest 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.180
 the bird that we see walking with its large webbed feet eternal put 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.610
 balls 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 these palmipeds make their nest with soil and mixed plants 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 to their saliva and proves their game 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 thousands of breasts flying over us 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.380
 is it a missed landing 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 in fact they make their enemies under the ground 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 and that's where the students reach out of everyone in circles 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 these are thannois called the penguins of light-hearted stars and all 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.240
 once they have their food in their beak they have to cross steep cliffs 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.510
 to regain their island 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.160
 then they climb the hills and encounter obstacles along the way 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.890
 this journey ends when they find their little giant under the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 nose inside the forest 10 it is sometimes very far from the sea 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 but a flat and safe terrain to avoid a range of all kinds 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.300
 it is said that the ancestors of the witnesses under the mayor who was doing 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 their nest in the forests 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.800
 these waterfowl must assess the cliff% hatches and their prey 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.090
 it can be risky but l for adult stages 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 m 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.419
 this cushion the attacked perpetrated the giant 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.349
 hot and cold currents these encounters around the islands that 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.729
 produce large amounts of plankton 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.829
 hold big fish straighten out to eat the tour plan 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.829
 then the African network it will no longer be possible 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:55.160
 this southern forest is a wonderful visual example of nature's work 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.330
 over many centuries
