base on Hoth the graphics are absolutely
insane<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.369> fact<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.910> running<00:00:24.210> on

until<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> believe<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.869> pick<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.229> something<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
until I believe you pick up something on

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.200 
until I believe you pick up something on
the<00:01:22.860> battlefield<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.640> there's<00:01:23.820> sort<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> these

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the battlefield so there's sort of these

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.390 
the battlefield so there's sort of these
battle<00:01:24.570> pickups<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.170> walk<00:01:25.380> over<00:01:25.619> symbols<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
battle pickups you walk over symbols on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.740 
battle pickups you walk over symbols on
the<00:01:26.490> battlefield<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> they'll<00:01:27.390> give<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the battlefield and they'll give you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
the battlefield and they'll give you
certain<00:01:28.020> kinds<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> weapons<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.070> or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
certain kinds of weapons and or

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
certain kinds of weapons and or
abilities<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.180> rebel<00:01:30.420> trooper<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
abilities this rebel trooper here just

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
abilities this rebel trooper here just
picked<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.979> smart<00:01:32.430> rocket<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
picked up a smart rocket and because the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
picked up a smart rocket and because the
symbol<00:01:34.170> he<00:01:34.320> walked<00:01:34.560> over<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.040> sort<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
symbol he walked over was sort of a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100 
symbol he walked over was sort of a
generic<00:01:35.549> symbol<00:01:36.119> rather<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> rocket

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
generic symbol rather than a rocket

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
generic symbol rather than a rocket
symbol<00:01:37.530> leads<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> believe<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
symbol leads me to believe that the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
symbol leads me to believe that the
battle<00:01:39.180> pickups<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.659> probably<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
battle pickups are probably going to be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
battle pickups are probably going to be
randomized<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> won't<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.670> able<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.939> camp

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
randomized so you won't be able to camp

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
randomized so you won't be able to camp
specific<00:01:43.020> types<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> battle<00:01:43.740> pickups<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.729> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
specific types of battle pickups if you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.700 
specific types of battle pickups if you
know<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> best<00:01:45.570> ones<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> think

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
know where the best ones are and I think

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
know where the best ones are and I think
that's<00:01:46.860> kind<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> cool<00:01:47.340> idea<00:01:47.549> especially<00:01:47.880> if

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that's kind of a cool idea especially if

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
that's kind of a cool idea especially if
some<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> battle<00:01:48.750> pickups<00:01:49.110> are<00:01:49.320> extremely

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
some of the battle pickups are extremely

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
some of the battle pickups are extremely
good<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.329> lots<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> players

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
good you would just get lots of players

good you would just get lots of players
camping<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.619> you'll<00:01:52.829> notice<00:01:53.100> also<00:01:53.280> after<00:01:53.670> he

again<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.560> help<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.890> represented<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.700> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
seems to have a very fast auto regen
feature<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.829> slow

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
feature so it's not going to be slow

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.310

over<00:02:05.549> time<00:02:05.820> regeneration<00:02:06.420> once<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> add<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
over time regeneration once you add a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
over time regeneration once you add a
combat<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.979> long<00:02:08.129> enough<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> seems<00:02:08.670> like

combat for long enough it seems like

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.979 
combat for long enough it seems like
you'll<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.420> back<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.660> full<00:02:09.959> health

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

pretty quickly very similar to say the

pretty quickly very similar to say the

of capturing up links are yet but I'm

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
of capturing up links are yet but I'm
sure<00:02:16.950> we'll<00:02:16.980> find<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.610> soon<00:02:17.970> enough<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.510> as

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
you can see you can control the 8080 on
rails<00:02:21.599> or<00:02:22.080> at<00:02:22.410> least<00:02:22.770> control<00:02:23.220> its<00:02:23.459> head<00:02:23.790> it

the<00:02:29.880> orbital<00:02:30.450> strike<00:02:30.690> seems<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.350> pretty

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the orbital strike seems to be pretty

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.380 
the orbital strike seems to be pretty
damn<00:02:31.980> powerful<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.700> again<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.239> have<00:02:33.360> a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
damn powerful and again we have a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.360 
damn powerful and again we have a
recharge<00:02:33.930> timer<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.500> those<00:02:34.650> abilities<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
UI overall seems to be pretty darn

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.720 
UI overall seems to be pretty darn
simple<00:02:37.500> now<00:02:37.980> we're<00:02:38.100> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> switch<00:02:38.459> over<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
simple now we're going to switch over to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.240 
simple now we're going to switch over to
the<00:02:38.970> perspective<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:40.019> snow<00:02:40.500> speeder<00:02:40.800> here

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the perspective of a snow speeder here

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.070 
the perspective of a snow speeder here
showing<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.269> only<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.750> fly<00:02:43.050> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
showing you that not only can you fly a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
showing you that not only can you fly a
snow<00:02:43.380> speeder<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.950> there's<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.400> be

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
snow speeder but there's going to be

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.910 
snow speeder but there's going to be
tight<00:02:44.730> fighters<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.260> x-wings<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.440> boot<00:02:46.620> and

tight fighters and x-wings to boot and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
tight fighters and x-wings to boot and
the<00:02:46.950> snowspeeder<00:02:47.819> seem<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.180> they're<00:02:48.330> doing

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the snowspeeder seem like they're doing

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.900 
the snowspeeder seem like they're doing
some<00:02:48.840> decent<00:02:49.290> damage<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.769> those<00:02:49.890> 80<00:02:50.160> 80<00:02:50.430> s<00:02:50.640> but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
some decent damage to those 80 80 s but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.670 
some decent damage to those 80 80 s but
just<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> movie<00:02:52.170> you'll<00:02:52.350> see<00:02:52.530> that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
just like in the movie you'll see that

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.930 
just like in the movie you'll see that
the<00:02:52.830> snowspeeders<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.519> pretty<00:02:53.730> darn

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the snowspeeders are pretty darn

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.970 
the snowspeeders are pretty darn
vulnerable<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.989> little<00:02:55.380> yellow<00:02:55.590> bar<00:02:55.890> at

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
the bottom of the screen looks like it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.210 
the bottom of the screen looks like it's
representing<00:02:57.989> your<00:02:58.110> throttle<00:02:58.680> how<00:02:58.860> much<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
representing your throttle how much you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.710

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
have put on that throttle and then

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.539 
have put on that throttle and then
there's<00:03:00.930> also<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.560> red<00:03:01.890> icon<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.430> the

lower<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.819> corner<00:03:03.239> when<00:03:03.810> activated<00:03:04.380> it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
lower right corner when activated it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.380 
lower right corner when activated it
looks<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.799> maybe<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.130> boost<00:03:05.489> icon<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.150> use

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
looks like maybe a boost icon that I use

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.820 
looks like maybe a boost icon that I use
there<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.810> sort<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.049> get<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> action

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
there to sort of get out of the action

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.590 
there to sort of get out of the action
very<00:03:08.250> quickly<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.000> again<00:03:09.390> has<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
very quickly and that again has a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.509 
very quickly and that again has a
recharge<00:03:10.110> timer<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.950> course<00:03:10.980> you've<00:03:11.340> got

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
recharge timer and of course you've got

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.550 
recharge timer and of course you've got
to<00:03:11.640> have<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.880> fire<00:03:12.120> tow<00:03:12.450> cable<00:03:12.870> option<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.440> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
to have the fire tow cable option as you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.920 
to have the fire tow cable option as you
fly<00:03:13.799> near<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.459> legs<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.880> 8080<00:03:15.420> as<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
fly near the legs of the 8080 as you can

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.170 
fly near the legs of the 8080 as you can
see<00:03:16.049> its<00:03:16.170> health<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.500> very<00:03:16.530> high<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.910> guess

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
see its health is very high but I guess

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.940 
see its health is very high but I guess
once<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.480> complete<00:03:18.930> enough<00:03:19.350> passes<00:03:19.829> around

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
once you complete enough passes around

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.949 
once you complete enough passes around
the<00:03:20.190> legs<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.700> will<00:03:20.820> take<00:03:21.030> down<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.420> 8080

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
the legs you will take down the 8080

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.840 
the legs you will take down the 8080
once<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.650> course<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.010> defenses<00:03:23.519> are<00:03:23.670> down

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
once of course the defenses are down

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.490 
once of course the defenses are down
also<00:03:24.359> left<00:03:24.630> side<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> screen<00:03:25.109> you'll<00:03:25.440> see

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
also left side of the screen you'll see

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.440 
also left side of the screen you'll see
a<00:03:25.590> rebel<00:03:25.950> troops<00:03:26.220> celebrating<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.239> might

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
a rebel troops celebrating so it might

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.020 
a rebel troops celebrating so it might
be<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.630> celebration<00:03:28.500> emotes<00:03:29.130> available<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.880> the

be a celebration emotes available in the
game<00:03:30.239> we'll<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.660> if<00:03:30.750> there's<00:03:30.989> some<00:03:31.140> tots<00:03:31.410> as

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
game we'll see if there's some tots as

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.199 
game we'll see if there's some tots as
well<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.250> we've<00:03:32.400> got<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.700> TIE<00:03:32.850> fighters

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
well now we've got the TIE fighters

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.360 
well now we've got the TIE fighters
perspective<00:03:33.810> showing<00:03:34.140> at<00:03:34.260> least<00:03:34.650> five<00:03:35.070> type

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
perspective showing at least five type

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
perspective showing at least five type
fighters<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.090> assault<00:03:36.390> there<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.170> then

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
fighters on the assault there and then

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.289 
fighters on the assault there and then
we<00:03:37.350> had<00:03:37.500> two<00:03:37.739> x-wings<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> two<00:03:38.549> snowspeeders

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
we had two x-wings and two snowspeeders

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.390 
we had two x-wings and two snowspeeders
in<00:03:39.480> frame<00:03:39.840> at<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.109> same<00:03:40.350> time<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> believe

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
in frame at the same time so I believe

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.860 
in frame at the same time so I believe
it's<00:03:41.670> probably<00:03:41.970> going<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.209> at<00:03:42.390> least<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it's probably going to be at least a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.229 
it's probably going to be at least a
five<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.320> five<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:44.040> far<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.549> aerial<00:03:45.000> combat

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
five on five as far as the aerial combat

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.539 
five on five as far as the aerial combat
is<00:03:45.630> concerned<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.739> looks<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.190> ion

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
is concerned and it looks like the ion

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.250 
is concerned and it looks like the ion
cannon<00:03:47.970> there<00:03:48.090> actually<00:03:48.480> got<00:03:48.660> blown<00:03:48.930> up<00:03:48.959> by

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
cannon there actually got blown up by

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.530 
cannon there actually got blown up by
some<00:03:49.470> orbital<00:03:49.980> shots<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.489> it's<00:03:50.760> probably<00:03:51.239> more

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
some orbital shots so it's probably more

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
some orbital shots so it's probably more
of<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.720> scripted<00:03:51.989> event<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:52.859> taking<00:03:53.220> out<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
of a scripted event with taking out the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.250 
of a scripted event with taking out the
ion<00:03:53.760> cannon<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.329> not<00:03:54.510> actually<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.019> TIE

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
ion cannon and not actually a TIE

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.349 
ion cannon and not actually a TIE
fighter<00:03:55.530> pass<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.400> aerial<00:03:56.760> vehicles<00:03:57.180> look

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
fighter pass the aerial vehicles look

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.090 
fighter pass the aerial vehicles look
pretty<00:03:57.569> darn<00:03:57.720> maneuverable<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> probably

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
pretty darn maneuverable and probably

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.099 
pretty darn maneuverable and probably
have<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> little<00:03:59.489> bit<00:03:59.670> more<00:03:59.850> arcadey<00:04:00.480> controls

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
have a little bit more arcadey controls

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.690 
have a little bit more arcadey controls
there<00:04:01.350> as<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.739> fighters<00:04:02.250> aren't<00:04:02.489> really

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
there as the fighters aren't really

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.280 
there as the fighters aren't really
banking<00:04:03.120> too<00:04:03.359> much<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.720> make<00:04:03.870> those<00:04:04.049> tight

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
banking too much to make those tight

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.229 
banking too much to make those tight
turns<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.430> another<00:04:05.640> rebel<00:04:05.880> troop

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
turns here we see another rebel troop

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.379 
turns here we see another rebel troop
using<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> DLT<00:04:07.019> 19<00:04:07.739> heavy<00:04:08.010> blaster<00:04:08.700> rifle<00:04:09.239> he

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
using the DLT 19 heavy blaster rifle he

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.150 
using the DLT 19 heavy blaster rifle he
seems<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.750> be<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.989> same<00:04:10.170> classes<00:04:10.650> before<00:04:10.799> but

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
seems to be the same classes before but

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.890 
seems to be the same classes before but
has<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> different<00:04:11.970> weapon<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.630> when

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
has a different weapon and when

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.180 
has a different weapon and when
switching<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.380> third-person<00:04:13.799> perspective

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
switching the third-person perspective

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640 
switching the third-person perspective
you<00:04:14.730> see<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.060> he<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.269> actually<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.930> Rodian

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
you see that he is actually a Rodian

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.199 
you see that he is actually a Rodian
which<00:04:16.889> is<00:04:17.039> really<00:04:17.340> cool<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.609> love<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.030> they're

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
which is really cool I love that they're

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.640 
which is really cool I love that they're
doing<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.539> different<00:04:18.840> types<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.169> heads<00:04:19.440> that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
doing the different types of heads that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.320 
doing the different types of heads that
you<00:04:19.799> can<00:04:20.039> customize<00:04:20.519> your<00:04:20.669> character<00:04:20.729> with

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
you can customize your character with

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.029 
you can customize your character with
cuz<00:04:21.570> i<00:04:21.780> mean<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.019> Rebel<00:04:22.320> Alliance<00:04:22.380> wouldn't

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
cuz i mean the Rebel Alliance wouldn't

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.100 
cuz i mean the Rebel Alliance wouldn't
just<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.370> made<00:04:23.640> up<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.090> humans<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.690> here<00:04:25.020> is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
just be made up of humans and here is

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.810 
just be made up of humans and here is
teammate<00:04:25.380> puts<00:04:25.620> down<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> shield<00:04:26.099> generator

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
teammate puts down a shield generator

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.950 
teammate puts down a shield generator
and<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.970> guess<00:04:27.150> once<00:04:27.360> you're<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.930> can

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and I guess once you're in it you can

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.450 
and I guess once you're in it you can
actually<00:04:28.230> see<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.650> health<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.250> shield

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
actually see the health of the shield

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.340 
actually see the health of the shield
generator<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.150> now<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.300> camera<00:04:30.660> focuses<00:04:31.170> on

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
generator and now the camera focuses on

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.340 
generator and now the camera focuses on
a<00:04:31.380> rebel<00:04:31.920> shooting<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> 295<00:04:33.240> blaster<00:04:34.050> and

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
a rebel shooting is a 295 blaster and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.290 
a rebel shooting is a 295 blaster and
all<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.830> sudden<00:04:34.860> getting<00:04:35.430> four<00:04:35.670> stroke<00:04:36.000> and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
all of a sudden getting four stroke and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.420 
all of a sudden getting four stroke and
camera<00:04:36.690> pans<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.200> see<00:04:37.380> Darth<00:04:37.650> Vader<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.280> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
camera pans we see Darth Vader and it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.460 
camera pans we see Darth Vader and it
looks<00:04:38.640> like<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:39.210> turn<00:04:39.240> on<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:40.050> off<00:04:40.230> your

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
looks like you can turn on in off your

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.470 
looks like you can turn on in off your
lightsaber<00:04:40.920> mid<00:04:41.280> combat<00:04:41.760> which<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.180> pretty

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
lightsaber mid combat which is pretty

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.090 
lightsaber mid combat which is pretty
darn<00:04:42.630> cool<00:04:42.870> maybe<00:04:43.080> when<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.440> force<00:04:43.680> choke<00:04:43.920> you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
darn cool maybe when you force choke you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.010 
darn cool maybe when you force choke you
turn<00:04:44.310> off<00:04:44.550> your<00:04:44.580> light<00:04:44.970> saber<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.480> then<00:04:45.840> from

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
turn off your light saber and then from

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.930 
turn off your light saber and then from
the<00:04:46.170> perspective<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.890> Luke<00:04:47.220> we<00:04:47.400> see<00:04:47.580> him<00:04:47.730> take

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the perspective of Luke we see him take

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
the perspective of Luke we see him take
out<00:04:48.150> snow<00:04:48.570> troopers<00:04:48.990> with<00:04:49.140> one<00:04:49.410> swing<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.920> piece

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
out snow troopers with one swing a piece

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.400 
out snow troopers with one swing a piece
and<00:04:50.370> then<00:04:50.520> deflects<00:04:50.880> lasers<00:04:51.540> back<00:04:51.930> at<00:04:52.200> his

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
and then deflects lasers back at his

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.050 
and then deflects lasers back at his
target<00:04:52.800> killing<00:04:53.100> them<00:04:53.250> relatively<00:04:53.700> easily

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
target killing them relatively easily

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.910 
target killing them relatively easily
his<00:04:54.450> icon<00:04:54.870> seemed<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.260> indicate<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.710> he

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
his icon seemed to indicate that he

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.890 
his icon seemed to indicate that he
might<00:04:56.070> even<00:04:56.190> have<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.640> lightsaber<00:04:57.420> throw

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
might even have a lightsaber throw

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.990 
might even have a lightsaber throw
ability<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.800> after<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.130> force<00:04:59.460> push<00:04:59.700> he<00:04:59.880> had<00:04:59.970> a

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
ability and after a force push he had a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.970 
ability and after a force push he had a
pretty<00:05:00.330> substantial<00:05:01.110> cool<00:05:01.350> down<00:05:01.590> on<00:05:01.830> that

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
pretty substantial cool down on that

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.070 
pretty substantial cool down on that
ability<00:05:02.430> as<00:05:02.520> well<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.270> if<00:05:03.420> that<00:05:03.450> trailer

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
ability as well and as if that trailer

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.230 
ability as well and as if that trailer
was<00:05:04.260> not<00:05:04.290> epic<00:05:04.890> enough<00:05:05.220> they've<00:05:05.550> also<00:05:05.760> thrown

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
was not epic enough they've also thrown

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.540 
was not epic enough they've also thrown
in<00:05:06.420> the<00:05:06.540> co-op<00:05:07.020> gameplay<00:05:07.710> trailer<00:05:08.190> as<00:05:08.340> well

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
can also see your radar showing you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.280 
can also see your radar showing you
you're<00:05:29.010> out<00:05:29.160> of<00:05:29.190> bounds<00:05:29.520> limits<00:05:30.150> there<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.660> it

you're out of bounds limits there and it

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.990 
you're out of bounds limits there and it

seems like you have a pretty big combat
area<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.920> customize<00:05:34.920> your

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
area so you can customize your

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
the upper right you can see we're on

wave 1 of 15 fighting storm troopers and
as<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.230> progresses<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:44.010> enemies<00:05:44.490> will<00:05:44.940> get

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
as it progresses the enemies will get

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.360 
as it progresses the enemies will get
harder<00:05:45.330> we<00:05:45.720> also<00:05:45.870> see<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.170> drop<00:05:46.470> pot<00:05:46.680> here<00:05:47.010> after

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
harder we also see a drop pot here after

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.860 
harder we also see a drop pot here after
this<00:05:47.490> wave<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.030> appears<00:05:48.390> that<00:05:48.510> once<00:05:48.720> you

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
this wave and it appears that once you

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.050 
this wave and it appears that once you
fly<00:05:49.140> up<00:05:49.200> next<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:49.860> activate<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.670> you

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
fly up next to it and activate it you

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.360 
fly up next to it and activate it you
are<00:05:51.210> now<00:05:51.390> in<00:05:51.420> a<00:05:51.750> defend<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> pod<00:05:52.590> mission<00:05:53.160> mode

are now in a defend the pod mission mode

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.730 
are now in a defend the pod mission mode
so<00:05:53.730> rather<00:05:54.480> than<00:05:54.750> being<00:05:55.050> able<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.350> run<00:05:55.530> all

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
so rather than being able to run all

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.140 
so rather than being able to run all
over<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:56.130> place<00:05:56.340> it<00:05:56.520> seems<00:05:56.670> like<00:05:56.940> your

over the place it seems like your

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150 
over the place it seems like your
objectives<00:05:57.690> change<00:05:58.080> depending<00:05:58.590> on<00:05:58.620> what<00:05:58.950> wave

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
objectives change depending on what wave

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.860 
objectives change depending on what wave
you're<00:05:59.400> on<00:05:59.520> which<00:05:59.790> is<00:05:59.940> kind<00:06:00.150> of<00:06:00.210> cool<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.660> here

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
you're on which is kind of cool and here

during the waves and then it's quickly

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.930 
during the waves and then it's quickly
going<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.900> progress<00:06:31.260> us<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.650> wave<00:06:31.890> 15<00:06:32.490> in<00:06:32.730> which

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940
