00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
which is something I honestly didn't

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
which is something I honestly didn't
really<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.850> would<00:00:33.090> honestly<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> see

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
really like I would honestly like to see

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.220 
really like I would honestly like to see
some<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.040> progress<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> point

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
some way we can progress to the point

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
some way we can progress to the point
where<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.770> unlock<00:00:37.980> them<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> really

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
where we can unlock them to really

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
where we can unlock them to really
increase<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.360> longevity<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> new

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
increase the longevity and put a new

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
increase the longevity and put a new
goal<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> game<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
goal into the game to actually make it

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
goal into the game to actually make it
so<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.980> unlock<00:00:44.280> something<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so you have to unlock something and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
so you have to unlock something and
actually<00:00:45.239> progress<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> instead<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
actually progress to do it instead of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
actually progress to do it instead of
having<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.520> given<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.390> every

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
having it just given to you with every

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
having it just given to you with every
single<00:00:48.870> attachment<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> play

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
single attachment and just have you play

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.630 
single attachment and just have you play
around<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> claws<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> said

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
around with it now the claws like I said

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
around with it now the claws like I said
is<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> heavy<00:00:54.030> assault<00:00:54.180> rifle<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.809> actually

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
is a heavy assault rifle it's actually

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
is a heavy assault rifle it's actually
not<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.320> bad<00:00:55.710> though<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> only<00:00:56.430> problem

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
not that bad though the only problem

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.130 
not that bad though the only problem
with<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.270> recoil<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
with it is that the recoil and the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
with it is that the recoil and the
visual<00:00:58.680> recoil<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.090> claw<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
visual recoil that's in the claw is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.180 
visual recoil that's in the claw is
actually<00:01:01.079> quite<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.890> compare

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
actually quite a bit when you compare

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.429 
actually quite a bit when you compare
two<00:01:02.399> weapons<00:01:02.789> such<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> scar<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> fi7

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
two weapons such as the scar and the fi7

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.190 
two weapons such as the scar and the fi7
one<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.030> does<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.510> outplayed

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
one and it really does get outplayed

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
one and it really does get outplayed
multiple<00:01:08.130> times<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.210> honestly<00:01:09.540> thought

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
multiple times and I honestly thought

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
multiple times and I honestly thought
that<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.229> club<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.979> bigger<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that the club would be a bigger and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.730 
that the club would be a bigger and
better<00:01:12.090> performer<00:01:12.659> than<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> other

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
better performer than a lot of the other

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
better performer than a lot of the other
weapons<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> seems<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
weapons but it seems just to be a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.289 
weapons but it seems just to be a
primitive<00:01:15.990> in-between<00:01:16.890> between<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.700> light

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
primitive in-between between the light

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
primitive in-between between the light
machine<00:01:18.479> guns<00:01:18.869> which<00:01:19.259> still<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.310> play

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
machine guns which still can now play

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.999 
machine guns which still can now play
the<00:01:20.820> clock<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.900> assault<00:01:22.619> rifles

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the clock and then the assault rifles

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
the clock and then the assault rifles
which<00:01:23.280> honestly<00:01:23.700> still<00:01:24.180> outplay<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
which honestly still outplay it so it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
which honestly still outplay it so it's
is<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.310> normally<00:01:26.520> not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
is something on I would normally not

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.609 
is something on I would normally not
play<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.170> better

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
play with because there are better

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
play with because there are better
weapons<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.490> unlock<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.820> right

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
weapons that you can unlock it right

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300 
weapons that you can unlock it right
from<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> get-go<00:01:30.869> such<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> scarab<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.189> be

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
from the get-go such as a scarab can be

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
from the get-go such as a scarab can be
the<00:01:32.460> doubt<00:01:32.610> pretty<00:01:32.939> often<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.600> you're<00:01:33.810> playing

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the doubt pretty often if you're playing

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
the doubt pretty often if you're playing
in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.350> ranges<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> play<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
in the right ranges in to play in the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
in the right ranges in to play in the
right<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> next<00:01:36.930> weapon<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> rhino

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
right way now the next weapon is a rhino

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
right way now the next weapon is a rhino
the<00:01:38.100> right<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.299> been

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the right more actually has been

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.660 
the right more actually has been
recently<00:01:39.960> patched<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.650> induced<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.280> reduce

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
recently patched or induced to reduce

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789 
recently patched or induced to reduce
its<00:01:41.939> actual<00:01:42.360> range<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> damage

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
its actual range and like the damage

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.010 
its actual range and like the damage
drop-off<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
drop-off but it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870 
drop-off but it
still<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.469> probably<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.039> best<00:01:46.280> shotgun<00:01:46.729> in

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
still is probably the best shotgun in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.940 
still is probably the best shotgun in
the<00:01:46.939> game<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.420> one<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.170> best<00:01:48.380> weapons<00:01:48.799> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
the game and one of the best weapons to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.730 
the game and one of the best weapons to
use<00:01:49.130> all<00:01:49.429> around<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:50.329> Rhinos<00:01:50.630> a

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
use all around the Rhinos a

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.940 
use all around the Rhinos a
semi-automatic

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
semi-automatic

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.410 
semi-automatic

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
pump-action shotgun we're not

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.630 
pump-action shotgun we're not
pump-action<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.590> semi-automatic<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
pump-action is a semi-automatic but it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.850 
pump-action is a semi-automatic but it
reloads<00:01:56.060> like<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.509> pump-action<00:01:56.960> shotgun<00:01:57.560> shell

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
reloads like a pump-action shotgun shell

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.429 
reloads like a pump-action shotgun shell
by<00:01:58.039> shell<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:59.360> actually<00:01:59.569> is<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.929> pretty

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
by shell and it actually is a pretty

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.649 
by shell and it actually is a pretty
powerful<00:02:00.950> thing<00:02:01.310> it's<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.240> bit<00:02:02.479> less

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
powerful thing it's a little bit less

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.059 
powerful thing it's a little bit less
powerful<00:02:03.140> than<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.289> Marshall<00:02:03.740> even<00:02:03.979> though

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
powerful than the Marshall even though

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.949 
powerful than the Marshall even though
the<00:02:04.219> Marshall<00:02:04.610> kind<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.060> does<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:05.929> damage

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
the Marshall kind of does more damage

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.770 
the Marshall kind of does more damage
than<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.740> needs<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.130> actually<00:02:07.330> one<00:02:08.330> shot<00:02:08.569> kill

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
than it needs to actually one shot kill

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.690 
than it needs to actually one shot kill
someone<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.440> having<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.920> Rhino<00:02:10.129> be<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> little

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
someone so having the Rhino be a little

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.670 
someone so having the Rhino be a little
bit<00:02:10.789> less<00:02:10.970> powerful<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.569> guarantees<00:02:12.049> you<00:02:12.080> that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
bit less powerful it guarantees you that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380 
bit less powerful it guarantees you that
you'll<00:02:13.069> still<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.459> able<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.819> one-shot

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
you'll still be able to do one-shot

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.720 
you'll still be able to do one-shot
kills<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.049> then<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> semiotic<00:02:15.830> makes<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.580> so

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
kills and then the semiotic makes it so

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.970 
kills and then the semiotic makes it so
you<00:02:16.790> don't<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.360> read<00:02:17.660> cock<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.739> gun<00:02:18.769> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you don't have to read cock the gun and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.620 
you don't have to read cock the gun and
like<00:02:19.400> pretty<00:02:19.790> much<00:02:19.819> pump<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
like pretty much pump it like the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.809 
like pretty much pump it like the
Marshall<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:22.549> rate<00:02:22.700> of

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
Marshall but you just do the rate of

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.979 
Marshall but you just do the rate of
fire<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.120> little<00:02:23.360> bit<00:02:23.450> lower<00:02:23.630> than<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
fire is a little bit lower than the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.319 
fire is a little bit lower than the
jackal<00:02:24.470> even<00:02:24.920> though<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.250> still<00:02:25.549> ends<00:02:26.120> up

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
jackal even though it still ends up

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.759 
jackal even though it still ends up
being<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.959> bit<00:02:27.049> more<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.440> powerful

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
being a little bit more of a powerful

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.949 
being a little bit more of a powerful
weapon<00:02:28.099> it's<00:02:28.579> not<00:02:28.730> overpowered<00:02:29.450> simply<00:02:29.840> it

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
weapon it's not overpowered simply it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.569 
weapon it's not overpowered simply it
doesn't<00:02:30.290> beat<00:02:30.440> out<00:02:30.560> every<00:02:30.890> weapon<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.340> every

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
doesn't beat out every weapon in every

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.610 
doesn't beat out every weapon in every
case<00:02:32.030> though<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.900> actually<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.349> pretty

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
case though it is actually a pretty

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.800 
case though it is actually a pretty
powerful<00:02:33.829> weapon<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.640> something<00:02:35.360> they<00:02:35.480> still

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
powerful weapon and something they still

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.140 
powerful weapon and something they still
need<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> tweak<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.680> current<00:02:37.130> nerf<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.549> between

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
need a tweak in current nerf and between

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.030 
need a tweak in current nerf and between
the<00:02:38.329> two<00:02:38.480> weapons<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.959> Rhino<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.319> definitely

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
the two weapons the Rhino is definitely

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.430 
the two weapons the Rhino is definitely
one<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> would<00:02:40.790> play<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.090> more<00:02:41.599> often<00:02:42.079> now

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
one I would play with more often now

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
one I would play with more often now
when<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.069> comes<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.519> actual<00:02:43.700> Maps<00:02:44.180> they're

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
when it comes to the actual Maps they're

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.970 
when it comes to the actual Maps they're
only<00:02:44.569> two<00:02:44.810> maps<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.200> actually<00:02:45.349> like<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.620> play<00:02:45.950> on

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
only two maps I actually like to play on

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.280 
only two maps I actually like to play on
which<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.400> crossing<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.329> coastline<00:02:47.870> now<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
which is crossing and coastline now the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.020 
which is crossing and coastline now the
other<00:02:48.500> maps<00:02:48.769> which<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.220> Creek<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.819> scent

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
other maps which a Creek in the scent

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.729 
other maps which a Creek in the scent
are<00:02:50.180> actually<00:02:50.420> really<00:02:50.630> nice<00:02:50.900> ascent<00:02:51.560> is

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
are actually really nice ascent is

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.710 
are actually really nice ascent is
probably<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.250> nicest<00:02:52.549> map<00:02:53.000> though<00:02:53.329> one

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
probably the nicest map though one

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120 
probably the nicest map though one
actually<00:02:54.019> comes<00:02:54.139> out<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.470> playing<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.980> just

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
actually comes out to playing and just

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.500 
actually comes out to playing and just
having<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.609> little<00:02:55.819> bit<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.030> fun<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.359> like

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
having a little bit of fun I like

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.699 
having a little bit of fun I like
playing<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.840> close<00:02:57.049> fighting<00:02:57.319> because<00:02:57.590> of

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
playing on close fighting because of

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.509 
playing on close fighting because of
nostalgia

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
nostalgia

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.699 
nostalgia
so<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.880> map<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.359> my<00:02:59.510> opinion<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.079> still<00:03:00.290> tied

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
so that map in my opinion is still tied

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.530 
so that map in my opinion is still tied

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
much wins and it is a pretty fun game

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.190 
much wins and it is a pretty fun game
mode<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:38.370> probably<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.200> game

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
mode and it's probably one of the game

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.900 
mode and it's probably one of the game
modes<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.500> will<00:04:40.740> be<00:04:40.860> playing<00:04:41.130> more<00:04:41.400> when<00:04:41.820> it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
modes I will be playing more when it

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.820 
modes I will be playing more when it
comes<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.330> game<00:04:42.810> mode<00:04:42.840> such<00:04:43.140> as<00:04:43.290> crash<00:04:43.530> sight

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
comes to game mode such as crash sight

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.680 
comes to game mode such as crash sight
and<00:04:44.160> capture<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.730> relay<00:04:45.000> which<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.300> do<00:04:45.360> play

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
and capture the relay which I do play

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.780 
and capture the relay which I do play
quite<00:04:45.960> often<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.770> will<00:04:47.100> be<00:04:47.250> putting<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.610> in

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
quite often so I will be putting that in

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.580 
quite often so I will be putting that in
probably<00:04:47.940> my<00:04:48.240> top<00:04:48.300> three<00:04:48.780> game<00:04:49.200> modes<00:04:49.230> that

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
probably my top three game modes that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.900 
probably my top three game modes that
most<00:04:49.830> likely<00:04:50.100> be<00:04:50.190> playing<00:04:50.430> with<00:04:50.580> friends

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
most likely be playing with friends

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.820 
most likely be playing with friends
though<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.780> overall<00:04:52.200> grand<00:04:52.530> scheme<00:04:52.800> of

this DLC if you would pick it up or not
I<00:04:56.160> honestly<00:04:56.480> suggest<00:04:57.480> not<00:04:57.720> going<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.410> it

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
I honestly suggest not going to it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.680 
I honestly suggest not going to it
doesn't<00:04:59.310> really<00:04:59.400> add<00:04:59.490> things<00:05:00.120> into<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.510> game

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
doesn't really add things into the game

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.050 
doesn't really add things into the game

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.970 
that you're going to be using quite
often<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.570> weapons<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.410> can<00:05:04.590> use<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
spread them out even more really does

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.730 
spread them out even more really does
reduce<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.660> player<00:05:39.900> account<00:05:40.200> for<00:05:40.440> people

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
reduce the player account for people

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.140 
reduce the player account for people
that<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:40.950> obviously<00:05:41.190> are<00:05:41.669> can<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:41.910> playing

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.489 
instead of paying what I think I paid 15
bucks<00:06:10.009> for<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.550> and<00:06:10.729> if<00:06:11.240> you<00:06:11.779> more<00:06:12.199> people

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:12.499 
bucks for it and if you more people

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:13.570 
bucks for it and if you more people
would<00:06:12.590> have<00:06:12.680> purchased<00:06:13.069> it<00:06:13.219> they<00:06:13.370> would<00:06:13.490> have

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
would have purchased it they would have

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.640 
would have purchased it they would have
made<00:06:13.699> more<00:06:13.909> money<00:06:14.150> and<00:06:14.419> then<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:15.169> think<00:06:15.439> it

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
made more money and then I think it

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.869 
made more money and then I think it
would<00:06:15.740> have<00:06:15.860> brought<00:06:16.009> in<00:06:16.249> some<00:06:16.279> of<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.610> people

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
would have brought in some of the people

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.580 
would have brought in some of the people
in<00:06:16.999> the<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:17.389> like<00:06:17.599> the<00:06:17.749> past<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.229> played<00:06:18.439> the

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
in the and like the past that played the

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.439 
in the and like the past that played the
game<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:19.159> bought<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.550> game<00:06:19.669> but<00:06:19.909> just<00:06:20.060> stop

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
game and bought the game but just stop

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:21.969 
game and bought the game but just stop
playing<00:06:20.779> it<00:06:20.990> whoever<00:06:21.379> brought<00:06:21.529> them<00:06:21.740> back<00:06:21.919> in

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
playing it whoever brought them back in

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.279 
playing it whoever brought them back in
because<00:06:22.219> it's<00:06:22.430> a<00:06:22.520> cheap<00:06:22.759> DLC<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.539> really<00:06:24.050> will

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
because it's a cheap DLC and really will

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.719 
because it's a cheap DLC and really will
freshen<00:06:24.620> things<00:06:24.919> up<00:06:25.129> and<00:06:25.310> that's<00:06:25.430> what<00:06:25.639> it

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
freshen things up and that's what it

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.640 
freshen things up and that's what it
actually<00:06:25.879> did<00:06:26.210> he<00:06:26.599> did<00:06:26.810> freshen<00:06:27.259> things<00:06:27.409> up

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
actually did he did freshen things up

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.189 
actually did he did freshen things up
but<00:06:27.889> it's<00:06:28.430> just<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.999> lack<00:06:29.270> of<00:06:29.300> players<00:06:29.779> really

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
but it's just the lack of players really

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.489 
but it's just the lack of players really
does<00:06:30.439> hurt<00:06:30.800> Crysis<00:06:31.580> 3<00:06:31.689> and<00:06:32.689> then<00:06:32.839> the<00:06:32.960> cost<00:06:33.229> of

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:33.499 
does hurt Crysis 3 and then the cost of

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:37.360 
does hurt Crysis 3 and then the cost of
it<00:06:33.650> really<00:06:34.219> did<00:06:34.400> hurt<00:06:34.639> it<00:06:34.789> again<00:06:34.939> no<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:36.169> do<00:06:36.499> I<00:06:37.009> am

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
it really did hurt it again no I do I am

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.429 
it really did hurt it again no I do I am
saying<00:06:37.669> that<00:06:37.759> the<00:06:38.060> DLC<00:06:38.479> isn't<00:06:38.930> worth<00:06:39.110> it<00:06:39.259> so

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:39.439 
saying that the DLC isn't worth it so

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:41.260 
saying that the DLC isn't worth it so
that's<00:06:39.620> pretty<00:06:39.889> much<00:06:40.009> my<00:06:40.129> conclusion<00:06:40.909> for<00:06:41.150> is

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
that's pretty much my conclusion for is

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.790 
that's pretty much my conclusion for is
like<00:06:41.479> if<00:06:41.719> you<00:06:41.900> are<00:06:42.169> thinking<00:06:42.469> about<00:06:42.620> picking

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
like if you are thinking about picking

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.860 
like if you are thinking about picking
it<00:06:43.069> up<00:06:43.189> even<00:06:43.639> though<00:06:43.729> this<00:06:43.879> this<00:06:44.389> reviews<00:06:44.839> a

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
it up even though this this reviews a

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.480 
it up even though this this reviews a
little<00:06:45.169> bit<00:06:45.319> late<00:06:45.529> to<00:06:45.710> the<00:06:45.740> game<00:06:45.830> for<00:06:46.279> you<00:06:46.460> guys

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
little bit late to the game for you guys

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.450 
little bit late to the game for you guys
but<00:06:46.939> honestly<00:06:47.689> it's<00:06:47.990> just<00:06:48.259> it's<00:06:48.680> not<00:06:48.919> worth<00:06:49.249> it

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
but honestly it's just it's not worth it

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.519 
but honestly it's just it's not worth it
whatsoever<00:06:49.759> like<00:06:50.419> I<00:06:50.509> said<00:06:50.719> it<00:06:50.839> does<00:06:51.020> freshen

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
whatsoever like I said it does freshen

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.050 
whatsoever like I said it does freshen
things<00:06:51.680> up<00:06:51.919> but<00:06:52.099> it's<00:06:52.250> nothing<00:06:52.699> that's

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
things up but it's nothing that's

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.510 
things up but it's nothing that's
actually<00:06:53.449> worthy<00:06:53.750> enough<00:06:54.169> to<00:06:54.229> actually<00:06:55.069> go<00:06:55.310> in

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
actually worthy enough to actually go in

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.689 
actually worthy enough to actually go in
and<00:06:55.729> pick<00:06:56.149> up<00:06:56.360> $15<00:06:57.319> worth<00:06:57.439> of<00:06:57.589> a<00:06:57.680> DLC<00:06:58.129> when

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
and pick up $15 worth of a DLC when

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.939 
and pick up $15 worth of a DLC when
there<00:06:58.849> are<00:06:58.969> games<00:06:59.210> out<00:06:59.509> there<00:06:59.750> there<00:06:59.930> are<00:06:59.960> $15

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
there are games out there there are $15

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.769 
there are games out there there are $15
there<00:07:01.129> are<00:07:01.189> actually<00:07:01.520> really<00:07:01.729> good<00:07:01.969> games<00:07:02.300> so

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
there are actually really good games so

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.260 
there are actually really good games so
this<00:07:03.020> is<00:07:03.199> for<00:07:03.680> maps<00:07:03.949> to<00:07:04.370> game<00:07:04.639> modes<00:07:04.909> and<00:07:05.060> to

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
this is for maps to game modes and to

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.240 
this is for maps to game modes and to
weapons<00:07:05.689> even<00:07:06.139> though<00:07:06.229> one<00:07:06.500> weapons<00:07:06.919> actually

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
weapons even though one weapons actually

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.619 
weapons even though one weapons actually
pretty<00:07:07.430> good<00:07:07.580> both<00:07:07.939> the<00:07:08.120> game<00:07:08.300> modes<00:07:08.509> are

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
pretty good both the game modes are

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.360 
pretty good both the game modes are
alright<00:07:08.960> but<00:07:09.169> the<00:07:09.349> maps<00:07:09.620> themselves<00:07:09.800> just

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
alright but the maps themselves just

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.369 
alright but the maps themselves just
they<00:07:10.759> weren't<00:07:11.120> really<00:07:11.389> developed<00:07:12.020> well

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:12.379 
they weren't really developed well

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.040 
they weren't really developed well
enough<00:07:12.710> for<00:07:13.009> the<00:07:13.189> actual<00:07:13.610> crisis<00:07:14.210> themselves

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
enough for the actual crisis themselves

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.079 
enough for the actual crisis themselves
now<00:07:15.319> maybe<00:07:16.009> when<00:07:16.250> mods<00:07:16.520> come<00:07:16.789> out<00:07:16.909> in<00:07:16.999> the

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
now maybe when mods come out in the

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:19.719 
now maybe when mods come out in the
future<00:07:17.240> Crysis<00:07:18.050> 3<00:07:18.080> multiplayer<00:07:18.889> will<00:07:19.310> pick<00:07:19.550> up

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 
future Crysis 3 multiplayer will pick up

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.119 
future Crysis 3 multiplayer will pick up
again<00:07:19.879> those<00:07:20.360> those<00:07:20.960> are<00:07:21.110> all<00:07:21.259> community<00:07:21.800> made

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:22.129 
again those those are all community made

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.129 
again those those are all community made
so<00:07:22.490> it's<00:07:22.879> pretty<00:07:23.060> much<00:07:23.180> Crytek's<00:07:23.960> not

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
so it's pretty much Crytek's not

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.629 
so it's pretty much Crytek's not
spending<00:07:24.409> any<00:07:24.560> money<00:07:24.800> on<00:07:25.039> it<00:07:25.219> that's<00:07:25.430> what

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 
spending any money on it that's what

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.089 
spending any money on it that's what
