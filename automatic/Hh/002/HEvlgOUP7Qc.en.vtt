dub version the voice work is very good

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.750 
dub version the voice work is very good
particularly<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.470> Arrietty<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.340> her

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
particularly for Arrietty and her

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.400 
particularly for Arrietty and her
parents<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.360> didn't<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> voice

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410

for<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> boy<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.880> didn't<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.240> he<00:02:36.390> fit<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.930> just

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
for the boy I didn't think he fit I just

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.900 
for the boy I didn't think he fit I just
didn't<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:37.470> buy<00:02:37.770> into<00:02:38.040> his<00:02:38.340> performance

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
didn't really buy into his performance

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.700 
didn't really buy into his performance
it<00:02:39.090> seems<00:02:39.390> strained<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.320> didn't<00:02:40.590> seem

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
it seems strained and it didn't seem

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.290 
it seems strained and it didn't seem
like<00:02:40.860> he<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.100> giving<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.490> his<00:02:41.610> all<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.030> first

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
like he was giving it his all the first

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
like he was giving it his all the first
half<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> movie<00:02:42.720> was<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:42.990> interesting<00:02:43.740> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
half the movie was very interesting and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.980 
half the movie was very interesting and
filled<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.400> awe<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.940> Wonder<00:02:45.420> once<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
filled with awe and Wonder once that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.470 
filled with awe and Wonder once that
wore<00:02:46.500> off<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:47.280> movie<00:02:47.550> did<00:02:47.790> lose<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
wore off the movie did lose a little

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.450 
wore off the movie did lose a little
steam<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:49.110> too<00:02:49.320> much<00:02:49.590> though<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
steam not too much though it just the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.920 
steam not too much though it just the
first<00:02:50.640> half<00:02:50.910> was<00:02:51.120> better<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.720> always

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
first half was better and that's always

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.510 
first half was better and that's always
a<00:02:52.080> little<00:02:52.230> disappointing<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> always<00:02:53.310> like

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
a little disappointing I always like

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.190 
a little disappointing I always like
when<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.760> last<00:02:53.940> half<00:02:54.270> really<00:02:54.480> hits<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.960> but

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
when the last half really hits you but

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.390 
when the last half really hits you but
the<00:02:55.320> thing<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.500> when<00:02:55.710> we<00:02:55.770> did<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:56.280> is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the thing is when we did really well is

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.980 
the thing is when we did really well is
portray<00:02:56.700> realistic<00:02:57.240> characters<00:02:57.630> even<00:02:57.870> though

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990

beautifully animated and it's definitely

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.690 
beautifully animated and it's definitely
