00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.190
 the level of hierarchy the level that they have 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.990
 shown today this week the 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.090
 last week of the level that is 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.190
 truly showing that it is only 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.510
 to applaud them god want us to continue 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.090
 on this same path because it is true that 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.020
 this team has no ceiling if it continues 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.020
 playing the way that is background 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.920
 there's not much left yet 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.390
 obviously it was a very important game 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.760
 the one who lost today was far away 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.739
 of colo colo and thank god we could 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.570
 we could win it very well and 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.280
 I think we are just that it opens today 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.810
 in day that the monumental the truth that to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.000
 Midweek 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.150
 with good rhythm good circulation of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.070
 ball 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.610
 good defensive insurance that are what most 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.040
 he cares about the team more 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.770
 the arc at zero and the companions of 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.580
 forward we give you more peace of mind for 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.580
 they can do their plays 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.180
 and as you said this is important because 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 All players are fit for 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 competition to respond of equal 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.170
 way that if it were that if not 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.930
 was a partner then we are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.270
 happy we are leaving with two weeks very 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.550
 good job that was concentrated 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.740
 almost every day then I was 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.380
 pretty calm and happy good still 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.830
 towards God can mark again I do not know 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.830
 what's happening to me 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.549
 in like 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 understood the status of the quota that 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.270
 I was happy about that but but more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.609
 beyond the goals it seems to me that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.189
 team is showing a solidity the 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.890
 defensive part already good as you already 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.929
 know they ascended that party have not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.490
 converted two goals and we continue 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.590
 keeping us or Leon in that aspect 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.299
 that that many times puts us more 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.690
 rewarding to do goals for 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.380
 us that does not make a mature team a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.840
 balanced team and that what that does not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.130
 it satisfies us more than the same as another 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 thing that the same 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.430
 the match 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 if that means it's a campus 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.000
 very competitive that works that all 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.670
 enter in some way to get there 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 to the game logically all of it 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.489
 way then it 's a very good job 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.280
 done on behalf of the coaching staff and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.069
 two new ones getting this idea that they 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 they want to impose and the truth that thanks 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.390
 everything is coming out of it 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.660
 correct I think we are very 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.920
 well that's the main thing where we are 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.829
 when this guy 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.390
 we carry a line a very solid team 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.660
 where they do not create almost goal chances 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.700
 we're not scored and we're up 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.160
 some time we put goals by luck 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.590
 today the team was solid in the same 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.720
 time we could not maintain the position 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.250
 that he had in the first time but in 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.920
 no time we suffered we were not there 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.209
 solid in defense where I think that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.900
 they practically did not have any 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.900
 clear goal occasion 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.530
 we have already passed both from one year to 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.150
 happy and happy for having put a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.320
 important model in a match where 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.570
 It was very difficult I was stuck and nothing 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.410
 to continue like this with a lot of confidence and now 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.410
 to rest 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.470
 but rather that the first time what 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.540
 we played an equal match 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.770
 after the second time he told us 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.090
 it took a bit to have the tenure too 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.670
 that they put many people in attack 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.250
 they took out the traditional sides and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.460
 they put flyers then with more than 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.440
 with more people than with with with 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.420
 incidents were taking us a little 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.130
 our arch but without any kind of 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.500
 danger because at all times the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.540
 defense was very solid and did not let 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.590
 penetrate us in what we are doing very 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.960
 well aware of what we are 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.880
 playing I think the game what 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.530
 we handled very well for him we could not 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.970
 close before but good happy because 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.970
 we are left with the three points 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.190
 sure according to this match out there those 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.720
 nerves or by addicts which find 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.820
 well what are we playing cappella 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.500
 from the tip and we knew how to handle 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.600
 he handled it very well the times 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.040
 we were handling the ball well and good 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 He saw a great match to 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.840
 well well good happy because we continue 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.789
 with the zero in our arc we continue 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.289
 adding points we still got lost like that 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.879
 that the truth pleased for that with him 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.960
 for the performance of all my 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.759
 colleagues who are doing it very 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.860
 well and good that will be reflected all 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.319
 the sections that we had been doing 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.030
 we spent many days concentrating there 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.819
 leaving aside our family but 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.870
 well that does not help or support us in this 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.509
 work that is so important to 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.180
 we are very happy with groups 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.610
 to play is that I train because beyond 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.520
 the final results 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.050
 in each competition or all the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.419
 matches in a stimulated way 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.840
 really motivated are a team 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.840
 worthy of 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.180
 triumph we had to suffer at some point 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.880
 it seems to me that in the first time 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.650
 always played well during the 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.760
 party we dominate the actions through 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.040
 of the ball 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.290
 we found the goal it seems to me that 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.510
 We could have liquidated the game 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.820
 before and not allow any reaction 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.600
 they have a memory of tomÃ¡s costa 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.850
 that Pablo saves her but it seems to me that 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.580
 through the process of the match and the use 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.010
 of the ball and how we assume the 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.169
 driving the party and becoming an owner 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.360
 party from the ball 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.880
 just winners maybe you do not have the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.430
 objectivity for 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.500
 be accurate but it seems that 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.160
 sensations within the party were 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.160
 all good 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.630
 if it's a very long race to short 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.370
 distance 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.810
 we had to resolve this commitment 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.400
 we came from 5 matches in a row 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.560
 consecutive and today ends a first 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.460
 cycle for us we will begin to 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.800
 imagine others but with the same idea of 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.440
 play every three days with the commitment 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.660
 the effort as a base and the illusion that 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.660
 the players put the competition 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.620
 and I believe more in that we have won in 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.810
 solidity in maturity 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.720
 the unbeaten in the undefeated is the 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.300
 consequence of playing well of being solid 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.639
 despite facing any type 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.080
 of rival being true to our idea and not 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.240
 let the party go to where 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.389
 wants but to assume the leadership of 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.690
 party and how we did it today and good 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:04.180
 very satisfied by the performance of the 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.860
 team because we came from the game of 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.290
 Wednesday a very demanding match of 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.130
 cup and we play against a great rival to 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.130
 that we could break
