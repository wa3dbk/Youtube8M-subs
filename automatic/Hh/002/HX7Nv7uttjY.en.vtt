because<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.500> uses<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.889> same<00:05:12.130> size<00:05:13.289> gear<00:05:14.289> and

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
because it uses the same size gear and

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.250 
because it uses the same size gear and
bearing<00:05:15.270> but<00:05:16.270> there's<00:05:16.479> ones<00:05:16.750> out<00:05:16.900> there<00:05:17.080> for

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
bearing but there's ones out there for

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.589 
bearing but there's ones out there for
450<00:05:17.740> s<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.919> 700<00:05:18.430> s<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.150> once<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.360> get<00:05:19.449> that

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
450 s and 700 s so once you get that

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.969 
450 s and 700 s so once you get that
lined<00:05:19.840> up<00:05:19.990> fairly<00:05:20.349> straight<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:23.470> can<00:05:23.650> screw

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
lined up fairly straight you can screw

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.310 
lined up fairly straight you can screw
your<00:05:24.280> bearing<00:05:24.580> press<00:05:24.820> together<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.900> pushes

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
your bearing press together that pushes

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.120 
your bearing press together that pushes
the<00:05:26.470> new<00:05:26.620> bearing<00:05:27.010> in<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:29.530> again<00:05:29.800> once<00:05:29.979> you

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
the new bearing in and again once you

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.790 
the new bearing in and again once you
get<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.490> fairly<00:05:31.300> flush<00:05:31.659> or<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.289> below

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
get that fairly flush or just below

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.830 
get that fairly flush or just below
flush<00:05:33.400> you're<00:05:34.210> going<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.389> want<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.539> take<00:05:34.750> your

flush you're going to want to take your
bearing<00:05:35.169> press<00:05:35.409> apart<00:05:36.599> someone's<00:05:37.599> just<00:05:37.720> going

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
bearing press apart someone's just going

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.580 
bearing press apart someone's just going
to<00:05:37.990> go<00:05:38.139> just<00:05:38.470> below<00:05:38.620> flush

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
to go just below flush

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.260 
to go just below flush
we'll<00:05:40.860> go<00:05:40.980> ahead<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.130> take<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.520> apart<00:05:44.270> and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
we'll go ahead and take this apart and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.000 
we'll go ahead and take this apart and
now<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.450> can<00:05:45.750> put<00:05:45.930> on<00:05:46.020> my<00:05:46.050> traditional<00:05:46.680> bearing

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
now I can put on my traditional bearing

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:56.530 
now I can put on my traditional bearing
here<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:49.380> finish<00:05:49.800> pressing<00:05:50.250> that<00:05:50.370> in

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.660 

and<00:05:56.900> again<00:05:57.230> be<00:05:57.350> real<00:05:57.530> careful<00:05:57.830> that<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.370> set

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
and again be real careful that you set

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.400 
and again be real careful that you set
that<00:05:58.880> up<00:05:58.910> so<00:05:59.330> that<00:05:59.480> it's<00:05:59.600> nice<00:05:59.720> and<00:05:59.780> flush<00:06:00.230> so

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
that up so that it's nice and flush so

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.720 
that up so that it's nice and flush so
you're<00:06:00.530> pushing<00:06:00.860> on<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.040> outer<00:06:01.220> race<00:06:01.460> of<00:06:01.490> that

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
you're pushing on the outer race of that

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.360 
you're pushing on the outer race of that
bearing<00:06:03.250> now<00:06:04.250> this<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.580> gonna<00:06:04.730> go<00:06:04.820> in<00:06:05.150> just

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
bearing now this is gonna go in just

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.230 
bearing now this is gonna go in just
flush<00:06:07.370> with<00:06:07.670> either<00:06:07.790> side<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.850> this<00:06:10.970> main

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
flush with either side and this main

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.790 
flush with either side and this main
shaft<00:06:12.970> so<00:06:13.970> that's<00:06:14.270> not<00:06:14.480> quite<00:06:14.810> in<00:06:15.170> so<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:15.560> see

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
shaft so that's not quite in so you see

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.320 
shaft so that's not quite in so you see
that<00:06:15.980> bearing<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.490> pushed<00:06:16.760> out<00:06:16.880> a<00:06:16.940> little<00:06:17.090> bit

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
that bearing is pushed out a little bit

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.310 
that bearing is pushed out a little bit
I'm<00:06:17.510> going<00:06:17.600> to<00:06:17.660> go<00:06:17.750> ahead<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:17.990> put<00:06:18.080> that<00:06:18.110> back

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
I'm going to go ahead and put that back

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320 
I'm going to go ahead and put that back
together<00:06:18.500> get<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.520> flush<00:06:19.820> and<00:06:20.120> you'll

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
together get that flush and you'll

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.520 
together get that flush and you'll
notice<00:06:20.630> that<00:06:20.750> this<00:06:20.930> side<00:06:21.140> of<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.290> one-way

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
notice that this side of the one-way

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.250 
notice that this side of the one-way
bearing<00:06:21.830> sits<00:06:22.040> flush<00:06:22.280> with<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.580> bottom<00:06:22.730> here

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
bearing sits flush with the bottom here

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.810 
bearing sits flush with the bottom here
so<00:06:24.260> I<00:06:24.350> went<00:06:24.530> ahead<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:24.800> make<00:06:24.920> sure<00:06:25.100> my<00:06:25.400> my

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
bearings are nice and flush the bottom

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.530 
bearings are nice and flush the bottom
of<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:28.280> one-way<00:06:28.550> bearing<00:06:28.940> is<00:06:29.030> nice<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.330> flush

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540

you<00:06:49.490> can<00:06:49.610> rotate<00:06:49.790> that<00:06:50.740> it<00:06:51.740> goes<00:06:51.920> back

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
you can rotate that it goes back

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.160 
you can rotate that it goes back
together<00:06:52.310> you<00:06:53.060> rotate<00:06:53.420> that<00:06:53.630> so<00:06:53.900> they're<00:06:54.050> all

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
together you rotate that so they're all

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.840
