because<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.180> weather<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:43.629> difficult<00:00:44.079> to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
because the weather so difficult to

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.750 
because the weather so difficult to
predict<00:00:44.500> these<00:00:44.620> days<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.190> also<00:00:45.370> hard<00:00:45.699> to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
predict these days it's also hard to

tell when it's going to snow so we

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.259
