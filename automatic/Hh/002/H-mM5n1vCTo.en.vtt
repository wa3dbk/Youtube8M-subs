00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
these are currently buying for 8.7 k as

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
these are currently buying for 8.7 k as
you<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> video<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.649> adding<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you see in the video and adding on the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
you see in the video and adding on the
nature<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.000> cost<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> 110<00:00:48.989> GP<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.860> makes<00:00:50.070> your

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
nature in cost of 110 GP it makes your

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.869 
nature in cost of 110 GP it makes your
total<00:00:50.520> cost<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.140> 8810<00:00:52.140> GP<00:00:52.500> /<00:00:53.070> 1<00:00:53.280> item<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> do

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
total cost of 8810 GP / 1 item you do

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.560 
total cost of 8810 GP / 1 item you do
now<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> higher<00:00:54.600> value<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> item<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
now the higher value of this item is

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.439 
now the higher value of this item is
9300<00:00:57.570> GP<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.620> profit<00:00:59.010> per<00:00:59.160> 1<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.609> 490

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
9300 GP so this is profit per 1 or 490

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
9300 GP so this is profit per 1 or 490
GP<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> limit<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.829> item<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.340> 100

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
GP so the limit on this item is 100

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
GP so the limit on this item is 100
varsity<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> gain<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> maximum

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
varsity you want to gain the maximum

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
varsity you want to gain the maximum
amount<00:01:04.650> per<00:01:04.920> hour<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.400> stuff<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
amount per hour and stuff like that and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
amount per hour and stuff like that and
basically<00:01:06.630> make<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.080> most<00:01:07.320> money<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
basically make the most money you can I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.740 
basically make the most money you can I
would<00:01:08.430> ask<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.880> friends<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.479> ask<00:01:09.600> people

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
would ask your friends and ask people

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
would ask your friends and ask people
around<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> grand<00:01:10.380> exchange<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
around the grand exchange if they can

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
around the grand exchange if they can
fight<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.299> buy<00:01:12.450> off<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.869> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fight for you and you buy off them just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
fight for you and you buy off them just
so<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> works<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.119> lose

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so it works like that so you don't lose

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
so it works like that so you don't lose
any<00:01:15.390> money<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> stuff<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.619> they

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
any money and stuff like that but they

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.140 
any money and stuff like that but they
don't<00:01:16.979> lose<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.159> either<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> makes<00:01:18.000> sense

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
don't lose it either if that makes sense

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820 
don't lose it either if that makes sense
so<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> that'd<00:01:19.799> be

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so if you can do that and that'd be

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
so if you can do that and that'd be
great<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> obviously<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> maximizes<00:01:21.509> your

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
great and obviously it maximizes your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.719 
great and obviously it maximizes your
amount<00:01:22.140> per<00:01:22.320> hour<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> finish<00:01:23.549> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
amount per hour but you can finish this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
amount per hour but you can finish this
limit<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> 100<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.810> roughly<00:01:25.110> five<00:01:25.380> minutes<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
limit of 100 in roughly five minutes and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
limit of 100 in roughly five minutes and
in<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.330> made<00:01:27.509> roughly

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
in that time you have made roughly

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.530 
in that time you have made roughly
fortune<00:01:28.380> ok<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.579> by<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.790> number<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
fortune ok now going by this number and
