00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to be honest you know five grams was

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
to be honest you know five grams was
good<00:01:03.830> wasn't<00:01:04.830> enough<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.700> that's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
good wasn't enough and you know that's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
good wasn't enough and you know that's
when<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.240> raised<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> raised<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
when I'm raised it you know I raised it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.070 
when I'm raised it you know I raised it
from<00:01:07.500> five<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.400> went<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> ten

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
from five I went up to ten

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
from five I went up to ten
then<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.440> went<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> 20<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.370> that's<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
then I went to 20 and that's when I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.750 
then I went to 20 and that's when I
realized<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.680> no<00:01:13.890> limitations<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
realized that there is no limitations to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.540 
realized that there is no limitations to
what<00:01:14.910> I<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> boosted<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> up

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
what I can take so I boosted it up

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.430 
what I can take so I boosted it up
dramatically<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> mean<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.840> taking<00:01:19.050> anymore

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
dramatically I mean I'm taking anymore

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.950 
dramatically I mean I'm taking anymore
from<00:01:19.800> five<00:01:20.420> six<00:01:21.420> seven<00:01:22.320> thousand<00:01:22.830> grams<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.340> day

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
from five six seven thousand grams a day

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.150 
from five six seven thousand grams a day
so<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.650> working<00:01:25.920> well<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
so and it's working well for me but you

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.710 
so and it's working well for me but you
know<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.460> people<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.940> understand<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
know what people that understand is the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160 
know what people that understand is the
fact<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:33.120> has<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> ability<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
fact that you know it has the ability to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.130 
fact that you know it has the ability to
do<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.680> much<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.280> fact<00:01:35.550> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.180> Chuck<00:01:36.600> Norris

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
do so much in fact you know Chuck Norris

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
do so much in fact you know Chuck Norris
Chuck<00:01:37.890> Norris<00:01:38.460> takes<00:01:38.730> it<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> says<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> lot

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Chuck Norris takes it that says a lot

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.490 
Chuck Norris takes it that says a lot
right<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:42.420> hard<00:01:42.690> for<00:01:42.840> me<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> guess<00:01:43.200> me

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
right there it's hard for me to guess me

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.830 
right there it's hard for me to guess me
but<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.830> probably<00:01:44.040> did<00:01:44.550> save<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.030> life<00:01:45.060> four<00:01:45.690> or

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but it probably did save my life four or

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.880 
but it probably did save my life four or
five<00:01:46.050> times<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.680> simple

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
five times you know and it's so simple

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.820 
five times you know and it's so simple
to<00:01:50.100> take<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.729> post-workout<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.870> when

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
to take it just post-workout and when

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.560 
to take it just post-workout and when
you<00:01:52.890> explore<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.430> yourself<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.300> body
