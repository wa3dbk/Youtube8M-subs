00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what they say they have this blend of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.410 
what they say they have this blend of
ingredients<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.430> there's<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.150> three<00:01:06.330> or

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
ingredients on there's like three or

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.890 
ingredients on there's like three or
four<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.500> stimulate

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
four of them they stimulate

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
four of them they stimulate
erythropoietin<00:01:10.159> which<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.430> hormone<00:01:12.000> produced

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
erythropoietin which is hormone produced

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.710 
erythropoietin which is hormone produced
a<00:01:12.450> kidney<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:14.060> stimulates<00:01:15.060> red<00:01:15.240> blood<00:01:15.479> cell

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
a kidney that stimulates red blood cell

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160 
a kidney that stimulates red blood cell
production<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> by<00:01:17.640> doing<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.720> increase

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
production so by doing that you increase

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
production so by doing that you increase
your<00:01:19.290> blood<00:01:19.470> volume<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:21.000> blood<00:01:21.270> via<00:01:21.479> muscles

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
your blood volume more blood via muscles

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.370 
your blood volume more blood via muscles
more<00:01:22.020> oxygen<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.619> muscles<00:01:22.950> bigger<00:01:23.400> pumps

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
more oxygen your muscles bigger pumps

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.179 
more oxygen your muscles bigger pumps
whether<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.189> keys<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
whether or not that's the keys and the

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.380 
whether or not that's the keys and the

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.909 

well<00:03:57.659> there's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.989> lot<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.169> ingredients<00:03:58.379> so

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
well there's a lot of ingredients so

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:07.559 
well there's a lot of ingredients so
it's<00:03:59.069> got<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> lot<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.579> powder<00:03:59.849> I<00:03:59.970> guess

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.910 

and<00:04:08.569> then<00:04:08.719> open<00:04:09.049> that<00:04:09.170> very<00:04:09.409> well<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:09.799> it's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
and then open that very well so it's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.459 
and then open that very well so it's
taking<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.400> long<00:04:10.489> time<00:04:10.790> come<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:14.349> there's<00:04:15.349> no

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.469 
taking a long time come on there's no

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.340 
taking a long time come on there's no

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.300 

I<00:04:30.210> don't<00:04:30.870> notice<00:04:31.200> that<00:04:31.350> they<00:04:31.500> they<00:04:31.860> list<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
blends or proprietary blend so they're

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.320
