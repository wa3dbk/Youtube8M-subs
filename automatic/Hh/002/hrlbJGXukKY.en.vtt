honest I don't actually know what this
is<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.799> think<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.280> could<00:02:27.489> be<00:02:27.609> like<00:02:27.760> that's<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
is I think this could be like that's the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.640 
is I think this could be like that's the
right<00:02:28.359> from<00:02:28.629> unless<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.079> engineer<00:02:29.499> that's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
right from unless the engineer that's

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.030 
right from unless the engineer that's
the<00:02:29.829> medic<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.310> then<00:02:30.430> that's<00:02:30.609> a<00:02:30.700> sniper<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> uh

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the medic and then that's a sniper so uh

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.879 
the medic and then that's a sniper so uh
and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.420> can<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.749> you<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.409> buy<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.620> and

why<00:04:36.729> there<00:04:36.939> is<00:04:36.969> a<00:04:37.060> shovel<00:04:37.479> but<00:04:37.689> maybe<00:04:39.659> okay

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
why there is a shovel but maybe okay

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.420 
why there is a shovel but maybe okay
strong<00:04:41.800> attack<00:04:42.069> so<00:04:42.219> I<00:04:42.280> guess<00:04:44.069> based<00:04:45.069> so

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
strong attack so I guess based so

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.189 
strong attack so I guess based so
basically<00:04:46.120> with<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.300> basic<00:04:46.599> camera<00:04:46.780> pack<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
basically with a basic camera pack you

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.080 
basically with a basic camera pack you
