is<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.519> can't<00:03:15.000> wear<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.330> out<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:15.989> i

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
is I can't wear it out like that so i

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.780 
is I can't wear it out like that so i
probably<00:03:16.410> will<00:03:16.739> not<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.130> wearing<00:03:17.310> out<00:03:17.580> like

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
probably will not be wearing out like

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.880 
probably will not be wearing out like
that<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.720> need<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> backless<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.799> all
