matter inside like I said you will get a
random<00:00:37.170> care<00:00:37.500> package<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
random care package so it could be a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.119 
random care package so it could be a
night<00:00:38.730> owl<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.239> could<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.690> maniac<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.980> could

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
night owl it could be a maniac it could

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
night owl it could be a maniac it could
be<00:00:41.250> anything<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.239> should<00:00:42.480> work<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.840> most

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
be anything this should work on most

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
be anything this should work on most
game<00:00:43.290> mode<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.620> think<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> only<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
game mode to think the only one it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
game mode to think the only one it
doesn't<00:00:44.489> work<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> domination<00:00:45.450> because

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
doesn't work on is domination because

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
doesn't work on is domination because
obviously<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.379> flag<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> middle

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
obviously the flag is set in the middle

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
obviously the flag is set in the middle
so<00:00:47.789> we're<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> move<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so we're now going to move on to the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
so we're now going to move on to the
next<00:00:49.020> map<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> war<00:00:49.860> hawk<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.660> will
