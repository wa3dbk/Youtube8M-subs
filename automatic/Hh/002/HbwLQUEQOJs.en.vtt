 who lives with their parents 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.950
 is what parents stop studying and 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.380
 playing in the old days did not like much more 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.080
 now that I've started for the championship 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.360
 so the result wins championship but is 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.140
 thing home so I guess start the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.940
 support me 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.270

 how you met the party anc not 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.929
 10 years ago was playing in the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.000
 cs 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.640
 then I'll download the program in baixaki O 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 There I heard a blank point there and I 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.220
 Apply, I just liked a question. 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.130
 random that you have always been played in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.399

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.280
 yes when at the beginning of the baby no more 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.410
 when I played access I already had a 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 craze that is so it plays we play neps 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.739
 team snapper but tv i got 100 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.569
 years and at the peak and then I 'll go 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:20.260
 to lose because it aggravates and 90 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:24.010
 I will not and I think it was the guy effort 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.720
 playing playing the dead even you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.300
 also optimism in an hour you go to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.990
 was 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.200
 recognition of the club in the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.200
 time 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.250

 inspired someone to be president 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.190
 for now I was inspired player but I think tb 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190
 that does not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.840
 It's really difficult today, I do not know. 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.640
 best not to me the best will have to 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.440

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.020
 understood 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.310
 sometimes it's not always good to be 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.930
 a lot of people talking to you 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.360
 can respond 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.360
 some people criticize something that you 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.310
 is not equal to it is good in a part 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.810
 minutes 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.190
 There is a day that you like this. 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.639
 knowledge sometimes find it very 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.210
 exaggerated 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.249
 Is recognition good, right? 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.550
 Do you have that recognition in you? 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:12.110
 practically enters a near time with 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.900
 almost any team you want 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.819
 Between drugs and guys, they know who they are. 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:25.099
 you know how you play but say 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:29.569
 very singular or good, yes but 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:32.529
 I better now so you only what 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:36.430
 think about the centuries 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:41.090
 You think it 's a waste of time. 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:45.349
 They're only there to waste their time. 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:53.539
 a score of zero to ten will be at stake 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:59.210
 to be made on 19 a note is for the 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:07.520

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:11.990
 that Brazil will be the new law will give 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.339
 last message every player wanted 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.089

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:22.550
 very fast to enter competitive 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.240
 I think you have no chance of continuing 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.069
 trying that even you losing you 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.139
