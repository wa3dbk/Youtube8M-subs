I<00:00:00.060> wanted<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.960> show<00:00:01.170> you<00:00:01.199> how<00:00:01.469> robust<00:00:01.979> the

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I wanted to show you how robust the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.900 
I wanted to show you how robust the
marisol<00:00:03.300> system<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.740> sample<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.819> in

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
marisol system is this sample of it in

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.290 
marisol system is this sample of it in
front<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.210> me<00:00:06.299> here<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:07.130> made<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.460> top<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.880> some

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
front of me here I made on top of some

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.049 
front of me here I made on top of some
cling<00:00:09.690> film<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.070> could<00:00:11.519> put<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.910> off

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
cling film so that I could put it off

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.419 
cling film so that I could put it off
and<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:13.170> exactly<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.769> doing<00:00:13.830> Elfie<00:00:14.309> it

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and do exactly what I'm doing Elfie it

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.820 
and do exactly what I'm doing Elfie it
just<00:00:14.580> shows<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.299> flexible<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.470> system

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
just shows you how flexible the system

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.849 
just shows you how flexible the system
is<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.699> strong<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> area

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
is and how strong it is now the area

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.279 
is and how strong it is now the area
that<00:00:20.130> I'm<00:00:20.250> pulling<00:00:20.609> now<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.750> got<00:00:22.020> no

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that I'm pulling now has got no

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.830 
that I'm pulling now has got no
reinforcing<00:00:23.220> fleece<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.539> got

system<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.750> really

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
system and is as you can see really

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
system and is as you can see really
really<00:00:31.560> quite<00:00:31.769> strong<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.700> other<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:33.210> has

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
really quite strong the other side has

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.030 
really quite strong the other side has
got<00:00:34.110> fleece<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
got fleece in it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.770 
got fleece in it
it's<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> few<00:00:36.000> crinkles<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> may<00:00:36.690> feel

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it's what a few crinkles and it may feel

now this box and if you haven't seen the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
now this box and if you haven't seen the
way<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> made<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> box<00:00:42.210> there's<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> link<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.170> how

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
way I made the box there's a link to how

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
way I made the box there's a link to how
I<00:00:43.530> built<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> box<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.460> screen<00:00:44.760> now

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I built the box on screen now

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.600 
I built the box on screen now
but<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> box<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.530> made<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.340> halves

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but this box here I made in two halves

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.690 
but this box here I made in two halves
as<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.300> half<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:49.039> just<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
as well one half is just with the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.630 
as well one half is just with the
detailing<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> other<00:00:52.020> half<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
detailing and the other half is with the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
detailing and the other half is with the
fleece<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.360> again<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
fleece and again you can see this is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
fleece and again you can see this is
really<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.449> strong<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.170> also

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
really really strong and it's also

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.369 
really really strong and it's also
really<00:00:58.620> really<00:00:59.190> flexible<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
really really flexible now if it's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.799 
really really flexible now if it's
applied<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> top<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.969> substrate<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
applied over the top of a substrate a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.270 
applied over the top of a substrate a
roof<00:01:04.280> timber<00:01:05.750> normally<00:01:06.750> OSB<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.530> pliers<00:01:07.890> like

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
roof timber normally OSB or pliers like

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
roof timber normally OSB or pliers like
this<00:01:08.340> sample<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> whole<00:01:09.720> thing

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this sample you can see the whole thing

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
this sample you can see the whole thing
is<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.650> solid<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:11.939> done<00:01:12.060> here

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
is really solid and what I've done here

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
is really solid and what I've done here
is<00:01:12.299> applied<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.229> different<00:01:13.409> ways<00:01:13.740> one

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is applied it in two different ways one

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.270 
is applied it in two different ways one
just<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> timber<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.740> with

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
just over the timber and the other with

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
just over the timber and the other with
the<00:01:17.430> reinforcing<00:01:18.030> fleece<00:01:18.810> inside<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the reinforcing fleece inside now the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
the reinforcing fleece inside now the
very<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.939> laid<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.270> both<00:01:21.420> these

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
very still can be laid in both these

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
very still can be laid in both these
different<00:01:21.960> ways<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.860> different

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
different ways it's just different

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
different ways it's just different
guarantees<00:01:23.729> given<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.390> different<00:01:24.420> systems

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
guarantees given for different systems

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.990 
guarantees given for different systems
the<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.560> build<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:26.850> we

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the more we build it out and the more we

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
the more we build it out and the more we
reinforce<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.320> longer<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.950> guarantee<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
reinforce it the longer the guarantee is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
reinforce it the longer the guarantee is
but<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.479> see<00:01:30.540> over<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> solid

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
but as you can see over a solid

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
but as you can see over a solid
substrate<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> unbelievably<00:01:34.229> strong

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
substrate this is unbelievably strong

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
substrate this is unbelievably strong
and<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.579> sorts<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.939> things<00:01:36.090> over

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and we can do all sorts of things over

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
and we can do all sorts of things over
the<00:01:36.450> top<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.869> well<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.770> broadcast

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the top of it as well we can broadcast

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.690 
the top of it as well we can broadcast
sands<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.659> different<00:01:40.170> kinds<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> materials

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sands and different kinds of materials

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.539 
sands and different kinds of materials
to<00:01:42.119> make<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.329> non-slip<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
to make it non-slip we can go over the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160 
to make it non-slip we can go over the
top<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.729> different<00:01:45.149> colors<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.049> can

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
top with different colors and we can

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
top with different colors and we can
make<00:01:46.350> balcony<00:01:47.009> systems<00:01:47.460> from<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.630> could

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
make balcony systems from it you could

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.149 
make balcony systems from it you could
actually<00:01:48.810> tile<00:01:49.229> directly<00:01:49.799> over<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> top

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
actually tile directly over the top

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually tile directly over the top
because<00:01:50.790> he<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> actually<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.899> solid<00:01:52.409> as

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
because he is actually very solid as

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
because he is actually very solid as
long<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> substrate<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> solid<00:01:54.119> so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
long as a substrate is solid so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
long as a substrate is solid so
hopefully<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:55.500> given<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> good

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
hopefully that's given you a good
