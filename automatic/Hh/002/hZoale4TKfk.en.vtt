00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 the sequence again at the start and this time 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.220
 with information on drinks in auvers much fun 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.750
 So friend at the Japanese expo was there 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 exclusive gameplay material too 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.799
 dragonball seaways like you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
 you can see between cell and cake and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 a short money away between awesome 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 seicento and super session vegeta me 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 The gameplay will now be in the background 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.590
 let it go and I'll get you one 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.480
 little to tell 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
 To be honest I have one now 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 few mixed feelings at the whole 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.830
 thing and that I find that that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.420
 Gameplay does not look bad though 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 a few things already exist 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 but complain about something more 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 look at the first look now 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.739
 should be noticed is the right 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 in the corner a kind of choice falls 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.870
 appears and I think that one the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 key nix circle square and triangle with 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 various super attacks prove 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.050
 Can this help to get around 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 to run combos faster and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.180
 or to combine them better 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 in the video we can see once that it 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 once such a kind column uses the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.930
 death ray and in the course of the videos 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.880
 still kamehameha what bothers me a bit 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.369
 it's just that the movements are something 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.560
 So the combos appear choppy 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.509
 something appears 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.979
 and I do not know if it's because of it 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.390
 that's what people are doing now 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.220
 just to play not like me 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.950
 get along with the control and yourself 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.700
 First of all, to the new control 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.700
 have to get used to it 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.210
 Herford 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.210
 two gameplay between wg to the big one 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.580
 transformation and useful as 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.380
 is a great job and I can only find it 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.450
 something a pity that the transformation and 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.800
 was held discreetly even if it was 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.710
 funny I find always thought that was cool 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.600
 so low examples that one 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.280
 small sequence had him because of ball 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.660
 raging blast where you could see how the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.550
 character is just transformed 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.550
 Nonetheless, you can see them in those 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.170
 Gameplay that the players seem to be 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.790
 and the combos 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 be faster 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.780
 but in the end it is a bit strange and funny 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.540
 I'm sure if this is a game error 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.040
 is or has cost on the attacks 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.800
 that he turn back 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.300
 must ensure that's now even 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.980
 hope again from me the video has you 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.630
 I also like it if I do not like it this time 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.040
 Nevertheless, I would be happy 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.430
 if you still handle a stinky finger 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 would 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.050
 otherwise for more info directly on 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.910
 the muffin button and how you see 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.250
 could not the video was from me so 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.810
 the gameplay video but from the channel 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.030

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.320

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.530
 on youtube a channel found the the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.270
 bio followed by one scale, with block 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.800
 4 completely in German, it shows real 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.620
 to cool the times to recover 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.570
