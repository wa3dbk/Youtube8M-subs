okay first things first let's see how

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.530 
okay first things first let's see how
they<00:00:43.620> stack<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:44.040> against<00:00:44.399> each<00:00:44.520> other<00:00:44.699> okay<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
they stack up against each other okay so

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.270 
they stack up against each other okay so
if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> screen<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> see

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
if you look on the screen you can see

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
if you look on the screen you can see
the<00:00:47.460> damage<00:00:47.670> between<00:00:48.059> both<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.600> weapons<00:00:49.050> as

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the damage between both these weapons as

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
the damage between both these weapons as
well<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.710> their<00:00:49.860> accuracy<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> speed<00:00:50.969> now

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
well as their accuracy and speed now

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.890 
well as their accuracy and speed now
since<00:00:52.320> nacho<00:00:53.129> spell<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> tr90<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.329> course<00:00:54.750> it's

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
since nacho spell is tr90 of course it's

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.780 
since nacho spell is tr90 of course it's
going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.199> better<00:00:55.350> damage<00:00:55.800> accuracy<00:00:56.400> but

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
going to have better damage accuracy but

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.910 
going to have better damage accuracy but
the<00:00:56.909> speed<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> slightly<00:00:57.899> slower<00:00:58.350> due<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the speed is slightly slower due to the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
the speed is slightly slower due to the
fact<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.220> it's<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.519> two<00:00:59.699> hander<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> we're

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
fact that it's a two hander so we're

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.719 
fact that it's a two hander so we're
going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.530> ahead<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.800> focus<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.460> three

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
going to go ahead and focus on three

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.549 
going to go ahead and focus on three
types<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> variables<00:01:03.360> now<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> first<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
types of variables now the first one is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
types of variables now the first one is
the<00:01:04.680> controlled<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.339> something<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.820> stays

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the controlled is something that stays

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.180 
the controlled is something that stays
the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:07.050> is<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.560> monster<00:01:07.860> we're

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
the same which is the monster we're

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.279 
the same which is the monster we're
killing<00:01:08.520> next<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.210> responding<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.050> is

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
killing next is the responding which is

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.380 
killing next is the responding which is
DPS<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> our<00:01:11.910> ability

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
DPS that we get out of our ability

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.930 
DPS that we get out of our ability
rotation<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.770> next<00:01:14.039> would<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.550> our

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
rotation on the next would be our

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.510 
rotation on the next would be our
manipulated<00:01:15.690> variable<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.590> stuff<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
manipulated variable which is stuff that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.900 
manipulated variable which is stuff that
we<00:01:18.179> change<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.050> would<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.380> our<00:01:19.590> weapons<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
we change which would be our weapons so

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.190 
we change which would be our weapons so
let's<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.210> ahead<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.720> gear<00:01:22.080> we're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
let's go ahead and see what gear we're

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.120 
let's go ahead and see what gear we're
going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.470> wielding<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.039> these

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to be wielding for these

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
going to be wielding for these
experiments<00:01:23.789> um<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.600> course<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
experiments um so of course I'm going to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
experiments um so of course I'm going to
be<00:01:25.289> rocking<00:01:25.679> out<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.920> void<00:01:26.360> superior<00:01:27.360> elite

um my range is 99 I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.249 
um my range is 99 I'm gonna go ahead and
be<00:01:32.399> under<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> effect<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.450> overload<00:01:34.050> as

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
be under the effect of an overload as

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so let's go ahead and test these weapons

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
so let's go ahead and test these weapons
out<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.560> we're<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.950> using<00:01:43.979> three

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out now we're going to be using three

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.870 
out now we're going to be using three
types<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.420> combat<00:01:45.750> modes<00:01:46.170> legacy<00:01:47.100> revolution

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
types of combat modes legacy revolution

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
types of combat modes legacy revolution
and<00:01:48.090> abilities<00:01:48.540> now<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.110> spend<00:01:49.500> more<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.829> on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and abilities now we spend more time on

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.160 
and abilities now we spend more time on
abilities<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.659> most<00:01:51.840> likely

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
abilities because it's the most likely

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490 
abilities because it's the most likely
to<00:01:52.259> IM<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:53.009> against<00:01:53.399> bossing<00:01:54.290> legacy<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to IM to use against bossing legacy of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.609 
to IM to use against bossing legacy of
course<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> old-style<00:01:57.990> combat

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
course is which is the old-style combat

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.160 
course is which is the old-style combat
mode<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.100> revolution<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.270> similar<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
mode and revolution is similar to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
mode and revolution is similar to
abilities<00:02:01.619> except<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.460> abilities<00:02:02.969> are<00:02:03.090> done

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
abilities except the abilities are done

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
combat modes for 50 kills ok so we time

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.340 
combat modes for 50 kills ok so we time

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
starts and all three types of combat

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.310 
starts and all three types of combat
modes<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:33.000> killed<00:02:33.269> King<00:02:33.540> black<00:02:33.750> dragon<00:02:34.140> about

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
modes we killed King black dragon about

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560 
modes we killed King black dragon about
300<00:02:34.980> times<00:02:35.250> which<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> good<00:02:36.030> amount<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.329> time

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
300 times which is a good amount of time

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.150 
300 times which is a good amount of time
to<00:02:36.810> get<00:02:36.930> good<00:02:37.290> analysis<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> DPS<00:02:38.820> data<00:02:39.630> back

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
to get good analysis and DPS data back

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.150 
to get good analysis and DPS data back
now<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:43.079> tr90<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.769> course<00:02:44.010> is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
now I can see that the tr90 of course is

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.280 
now I can see that the tr90 of course is
going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.579> better<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:45.810> three<00:02:46.019> types

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
going to be better and all three types

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.250 
going to be better and all three types
combat

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
combat

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.620 
combat
but<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.380> was<00:02:48.650> kind<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.100> iffy<00:02:49.250> legacy<00:02:50.120> was<00:02:50.420> all

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
but it was kind of iffy legacy was all

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.540 
but it was kind of iffy legacy was all
over<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.870> place<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.350> got<00:02:51.620> kills<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.280> were<00:02:52.430> up

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
over the place I got kills that were up

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.730 
over the place I got kills that were up
to<00:02:52.640> 30<00:02:52.880> seconds<00:02:53.330> or<00:02:53.480> even<00:02:53.540> as<00:02:54.140> high<00:02:54.290> as<00:02:54.350> 55

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
seconds all over the place now

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.650

revolution it was consistent the kills
took<00:02:59.900> longer<00:03:00.290> than<00:03:00.620> with<00:03:00.830> manual<00:03:01.340> dpsing<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
took longer than with manual dpsing and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.140 
took longer than with manual dpsing and
abilities<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:04.070> could<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:04.790> use<00:03:04.970> my

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
came out on top with about a hundred and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.390 
came out on top with about a hundred and

than the death loaded starts so yes

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.600 
than the death loaded starts so yes
let's<00:03:15.800> go<00:03:15.890> ahead<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.100> give<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> round<00:03:16.490> of

applause and not just bow for winning

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.500 
applause and not just bow for winning
now<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.280> don't<00:03:19.610> want<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.790> stop<00:03:20.000> right<00:03:20.240> there

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
now I don't want to stop right there

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.050 
now I don't want to stop right there
since<00:03:21.050> King<00:03:21.320> Black<00:03:21.530> Dragon<00:03:22.010> has<00:03:22.190> very<00:03:22.850> low

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
since King Black Dragon has very low

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000 
since King Black Dragon has very low
defense<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.840> want<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.350> how<00:03:24.470> these<00:03:24.590> perform

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
defense I want to see how these perform

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.490 
defense I want to see how these perform
against<00:03:25.459> higher<00:03:25.640> level<00:03:26.090> bosses<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.320> went

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
against higher level bosses so I went

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.980 
against higher level bosses so I went
ahead<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.040> took<00:03:28.310> these<00:03:28.670> weapons<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.780> went

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
ahead and took these weapons and I went

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.530 
ahead and took these weapons and I went
over<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.290> virago<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.790> wanted<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.270> go<00:03:32.420> ahead

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
over to virago now I wanted to go ahead

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.990 
over to virago now I wanted to go ahead
and<00:03:32.840> conduct<00:03:33.050> this<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:34.280> same<00:03:34.700> type<00:03:34.970> of

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
and conduct this in a same type of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.330 
and conduct this in a same type of
manner<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.810> wanted<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.470> on<00:03:36.590> face<00:03:36.950> too

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
manner but I wanted to do it on face too

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.670 
manner but I wanted to do it on face too
now<00:03:37.730> phase<00:03:38.000> two<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.330> virago<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> time<00:03:39.320> phase

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
now phase two on virago is a time phase

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.800 
now phase two on virago is a time phase
which<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.220> very<00:03:40.580> good<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.910> means<00:03:41.270> it'll<00:03:41.510> try

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
which is very good that means it'll try

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.350 
which is very good that means it'll try
to<00:03:41.870> say<00:03:42.200> controlled<00:03:42.770> somewhat<00:03:43.310> I'll<00:03:44.090> go<00:03:44.240> ahead

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
to say controlled somewhat I'll go ahead

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.810 
to say controlled somewhat I'll go ahead
and<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.780> similar<00:03:45.290> ability<00:03:45.860> rotation<00:03:46.370> except

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
and do a similar ability rotation except
