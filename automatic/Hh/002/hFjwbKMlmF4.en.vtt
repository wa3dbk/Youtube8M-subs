00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.160
It's incredible, given you have this phenomenal
film career, that Fresh Price doesn't go away.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.420
Listen, every country in the world, that is
the thing that I am most known for.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.700
No matter how big the movies get, it's the
Fresh Prince everywhere.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.140
Does that bug you? Or does-

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.360
Listen man, long as they screaming
'Will' I'm cool.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.900
But, it's funny because Alfonso Ribero who
plays Carlton-

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.071
when we first started the show we were trying
to come up with names for the characters and

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.650
we were going through them and talking about
it and Alfonso pulled me aside, he said 'Man,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.020
let me tell you something.'

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.880
He said 'Whatever your characters name is,
people are gonna call you that for the rest

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880
of your life.'

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.859
He said 'make your character's name Will Smith.'

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.520
He was so right, you know, when we go out
together people are like 'Will, Will!

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.580
Carlton!'

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.580
In fairness, Carlton's better than Alfonso.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.000
That's what he was thinking.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.400
I can correct this.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.080
Famously, you performed the title rap.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.300
Which I happen to know everyone knows.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.260
Oh, goodness.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.020
Everyone knows.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.980
Including me.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.900
Oh!

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.160
Let me hand this over.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.720
Oh geez!

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.540
It's quite heavy.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.520
Ok, here you go Gary.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.080

but get ready my friend.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.760

I remember it.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640
You really remember it.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.440
You didn't hesitate for a second.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.940
It is so funny that that many people recognise
that theme song.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.150
There's something about TV that's different
than movies or music.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.900
There's something about television that it's
like, I mean you're in your underwear at the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.320
house- you know it's- you don't get dressed
up to go.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.180
It's like, if people come into your house
and television really attaches you to people

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.160
in a way that is extremely powerful.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.420
It's humbling.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.470
Thank you.
