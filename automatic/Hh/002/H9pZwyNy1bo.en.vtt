00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.650

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.050

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.800
 the music really never makes it 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.450
 but you see the success in the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.970
 Hands clap even if it's hard 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.739
 were not believed a success I was 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.090

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.220
 straight up and you the people 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.110
 there is still something of vorgaukelt 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.000

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.410
 wannabes plate produces only 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.540
 in order that no one wants to hear anymore 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
 Now I'm there to catch the people 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.329

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.400

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.640
 enough energy and wait out here 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.600
 I also conquer the difficult way 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.930
 with small steps 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.780

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 get good feedback from the people 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.729

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.860
