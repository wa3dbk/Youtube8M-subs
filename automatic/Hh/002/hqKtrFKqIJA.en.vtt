00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.520 

it's<00:00:08.160> interesting<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.790> think<00:00:08.820> about<00:00:09.530> leading

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
it's interesting to think about leading

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.710 
it's interesting to think about leading
Indian<00:00:10.860> modernists<00:00:11.640> really<00:00:12.150> having<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720 
Indian modernists really having the

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.690 
Indian modernists really having the
strong<00:00:13.020> focus<00:00:13.350> on<00:00:13.740> figuration

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
strong focus on figuration

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.759

I<00:00:14.730> totally<00:00:15.090> however<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.840> one<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> first

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
I totally however was one of the first

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.400 
I totally however was one of the first
painters<00:00:17.400> who<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:17.970> started<00:00:18.779> exploring<00:00:19.169> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
painters who really started exploring a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710 
painters who really started exploring a
different<00:00:19.829> format<00:00:20.519> well<00:00:21.300> there's<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> really

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different format well there's a really

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.019 
different format well there's a really
strong<00:00:21.869> heritage<00:00:22.589> of<00:00:22.800> figuration<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.640> Indian

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
strong heritage of figuration in Indian

strong heritage of figuration in Indian
art<00:00:24.210> both<00:00:24.419> because<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.900> traditional<00:00:25.499> South

art both because of traditional South
Asian<00:00:26.249> art<00:00:26.429> and<00:00:26.929> because<00:00:27.929> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.199> British

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679

Asian art and because of the British
being<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> India<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.699> most<00:00:30.089> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> leading

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
being in India so most of the leading

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
being in India so most of the leading
modernist<00:00:31.349> artists<00:00:31.829> in<00:00:31.890> India<00:00:32.189> actually

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
modernist artists in India actually

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
modernist artists in India actually
started<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.870> figurative<00:00:34.170> mode<00:00:34.590> even<00:00:35.010> if

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
started off in a figurative mode even if

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
started off in a figurative mode even if
they<00:00:35.340> later<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.940> veered<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.840> abstraction

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
they later on veered into abstraction

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.890 
they later on veered into abstraction
and<00:00:37.770> certainly<00:00:38.100> Gaitan<00:00:38.520> day<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.970> among<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
and certainly Gaitan day was among the

by 1959 he's begun to pare down

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.320 
by 1959 he's begun to pare down
representational<00:00:51.370> forms<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.970> their<00:00:52.090> very

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
representational forms to their very

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.810 
representational forms to their very
essence<00:00:52.840> especially<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.770> work<00:00:53.920> called<00:00:54.610> a

essence especially in a work called a

last<00:00:56.610> representational<00:00:57.610> work<00:00:57.850> by<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.480> early

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
last representational work by the early

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.470 
last representational work by the early
1960s<00:00:59.770> he's<00:01:00.340> really<00:01:00.670> beginning<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.300> think

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
1960s he's really beginning to think

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.170 
1960s he's really beginning to think
much<00:01:01.690> more<00:01:01.989> about<00:01:02.260> form<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.040> purity<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.030> we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
much more about form and purity so we

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.390 
much more about form and purity so we
really<00:01:04.479> see<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.170> early<00:01:05.500> 60s<00:01:06.040> as<00:01:06.220> this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
really see the early 60s as this

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.310 
really see the early 60s as this
inflection<00:01:06.820> point<00:01:07.390> in<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.960> number<00:01:08.290> of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
inflection point in the number of

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.230 
inflection point in the number of
modernist<00:01:08.979> at<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.400> time<00:01:09.640> but<00:01:09.850> particularly

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
modernist at that time but particularly

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.190 
modernist at that time but particularly
enjoyed<00:01:10.840> on<00:01:11.020> his<00:01:11.760> practice<00:01:12.780> Gandhi<00:01:13.780> developed

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
enjoyed on his practice Gandhi developed

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.400 
enjoyed on his practice Gandhi developed
his<00:01:14.410> first<00:01:14.710> series<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.540> dedicated<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
his first series that is dedicated to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.499 
his first series that is dedicated to
exploring<00:01:17.770> principles<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.640> abstraction<00:01:19.270> as

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
exploring principles of abstraction as

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.170 
exploring principles of abstraction as
again<00:01:20.320> he<00:01:20.530> liked<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.860> refer<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.180> non-objective

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
again he liked to refer to non-objective

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.030 
again he liked to refer to non-objective
painting<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:23.170> concept<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:23.800> he<00:01:23.920> would

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
painting a concept that he would

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
painting a concept that he would
actually<00:01:24.160> spend<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.700> rest<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:25.090> his<00:01:25.240> life

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
actually spend the rest of his life

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.050 
actually spend the rest of his life
continuing<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.410> refine<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:27.430> we're<00:01:27.850> really

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
continuing to refine so we're really

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.530 
continuing to refine so we're really
looking<00:01:28.360> at<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.810> 1960s<00:01:29.800> then<00:01:30.070> in<00:01:30.880> terms<00:01:31.240> of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
looking at the 1960s then in terms of

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.380 
looking at the 1960s then in terms of
his<00:01:31.810> move<00:01:32.170> into<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:33.490> would<00:01:33.970> we<00:01:34.210> would

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
his move into what would we would

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.630 
his move into what would we would
describe<00:01:34.690> as<00:01:34.960> abstraction<00:01:35.680> very<00:01:36.040> often<00:01:36.430> when

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
describe as abstraction very often when

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.180 
describe as abstraction very often when
people<00:01:37.300> look<00:01:37.509> at<00:01:37.600> Gaitan<00:01:37.990> day's<00:01:38.140> work<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.860> see

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
people look at Gaitan day's work and see

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.639 
people look at Gaitan day's work and see
how<00:01:39.700> singular<00:01:40.210> his<00:01:40.420> vision<00:01:40.750> was<00:01:40.869> they

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
how singular his vision was they

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.469 
how singular his vision was they
naturally<00:01:42.100> draw<00:01:42.310> connections<00:01:42.610> between<00:01:43.000> his

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
naturally draw connections between his

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.090 
naturally draw connections between his
painting<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.380> was<00:01:44.500> happening<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
painting and what was happening in the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.040 
painting and what was happening in the
West<00:01:45.280> but<00:01:45.640> actually<00:01:46.060> gaitán<00:01:46.479> day<00:01:46.630> develops

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
West but actually gaitán day develops

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.260 
West but actually gaitán day develops
these<00:01:47.259> forms<00:01:47.800> even<00:01:48.160> before<00:01:48.520> he<00:01:48.789> travels<00:01:49.209> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
these forms even before he travels to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.749 
these forms even before he travels to
New<00:01:49.509> York<00:01:49.690> for<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.959> first<00:01:50.170> time<00:01:50.440> in<00:01:50.619> 1964<00:01:51.550> on<00:01:51.729> a

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
New York for the first time in 1964 on a

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.580 
New York for the first time in 1964 on a
rockefeller<00:01:52.360> fellowship<00:01:52.929> and<00:01:53.110> what<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.500> think

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
rockefeller fellowship and what I think

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.790 
rockefeller fellowship and what I think
that<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:54.009> speaks<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.459> is<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.800> broader

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
that this speaks to is a broader

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.400 
that this speaks to is a broader
cultural<00:01:57.310> zeitgeist<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:58.090> which<00:01:58.300> he<00:01:58.479> was<00:01:58.660> he

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
cultural zeitgeist of which he was he

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.550 
cultural zeitgeist of which he was he
was<00:01:59.560> part<00:01:59.860> he<00:02:00.250> clearly<00:02:00.819> as<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.119> mentioned<00:02:01.750> was

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
was part he clearly as you mentioned was

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.040 
was part he clearly as you mentioned was
looking<00:02:03.039> at<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.880> abstract<00:02:04.240> expressionist

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
looking at the abstract expressionist

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.219 
looking at the abstract expressionist
movements<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.890> also<00:02:06.399> was<00:02:07.300> influenced<00:02:08.020> by<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229
