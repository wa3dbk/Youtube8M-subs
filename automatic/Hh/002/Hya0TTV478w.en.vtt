see that back to the trailer and what

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.310

they<00:06:22.530> say<00:06:22.610> showed<00:06:23.610> in<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.820> trailers

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
they say showed in the trailers

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.469 
they say showed in the trailers
it<00:06:26.280> was<00:06:26.430> either<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.940> was<00:06:27.030> really<00:06:27.300> geared

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
it was either it was really geared

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.030 
it was either it was really geared
towards<00:06:27.600> girls<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.380> was<00:06:28.440> either<00:06:28.590> really<00:06:28.800> too

geared<00:06:29.370> towards<00:06:29.639> boys<00:06:29.880> I<00:06:30.360> think<00:06:30.960> the<00:06:31.440> movie

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
geared towards boys I think the movie

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.189 
geared towards boys I think the movie
really<00:06:32.040> has<00:06:32.460> something<00:06:33.210> for<00:06:33.240> everyone<00:06:33.600> it<00:06:34.050> was

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
really has something for everyone it was

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.980 
really has something for everyone it was
it<00:06:34.830> was<00:06:35.010> like<00:06:35.250> good<00:06:35.910> enough<00:06:36.000> for<00:06:36.270> families<00:06:36.720> but

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
it was like good enough for families but

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.659 
it was like good enough for families but
it's<00:06:37.080> not<00:06:37.169> something<00:06:37.380> that<00:06:37.500> you<00:06:37.680> say<00:06:37.860> all<00:06:38.010> only

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
it's not something that you say all only

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.070 
it's not something that you say all only
see<00:06:39.000> it<00:06:39.090> if<00:06:39.150> you<00:06:39.240> have<00:06:39.360> kids<00:06:39.630> if<00:06:39.840> something

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
that adults could enjoy too because

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.090 
that adults could enjoy too because

there were story elements and emotions

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.710 
there were story elements and emotions
through<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.580> storytelling<00:06:45.180> that<00:06:45.479> would

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
through the storytelling that would

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.610 
through the storytelling that would
there's<00:06:47.389> a<00:06:48.389> lot<00:06:48.600> of<00:06:48.720> action<00:06:48.900> you<00:06:49.320> know<00:06:49.410> it's<00:06:49.590> a

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
there's a lot of action you know it's a

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.560 
there's a lot of action you know it's a
lot<00:06:49.740> of<00:06:49.770> good<00:06:49.889> action<00:06:50.280> which<00:06:51.210> would<00:06:51.360> appeal<00:06:51.539> to

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
lot of good action which would appeal to

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.110 
lot of good action which would appeal to
boys<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.260> another<00:06:53.160> thing<00:06:53.340> is<00:06:53.460> that<00:06:53.490> in<00:06:53.880> some

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
boys and another thing is that in some

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.029 
boys and another thing is that in some
movies<00:06:54.479> they<00:06:54.900> have<00:06:54.930> a<00:06:55.080> really<00:06:55.350> strong<00:06:55.410> female

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
movies they have a really strong female

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.580 
movies they have a really strong female
lead<00:06:56.430> and<00:06:56.639> it's<00:06:57.210> it's<00:06:57.419> obvious<00:06:57.870> a<00:06:57.990> girl<00:06:58.260> movie

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
lead and it's it's obvious a girl movie

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.110 
lead and it's it's obvious a girl movie
right<00:06:58.919> it's<00:06:59.160> all<00:06:59.310> other<00:06:59.490> movies<00:06:59.850> there's<00:07:00.060> a

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
right it's all other movies there's a

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.480 
right it's all other movies there's a
really<00:07:00.840> strong<00:07:01.080> male<00:07:01.560> D<00:07:01.800> but<00:07:02.039> I<00:07:02.070> think<00:07:02.310> it<00:07:02.370> was

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
really strong male D but I think it was

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.200 
really strong male D but I think it was
really<00:07:03.090> equal<00:07:03.630> in<00:07:03.750> this<00:07:03.900> movie<00:07:04.340> basic<00:07:05.340> good<00:07:05.550> it

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
really equal in this movie basic good it

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.360 
really equal in this movie basic good it
reminded<00:07:06.750> me<00:07:06.810> a<00:07:06.900> lot<00:07:07.139> like<00:07:07.590> a<00:07:07.620> good<00:07:07.830> balance<00:07:08.220> of

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
reminded me a lot like a good balance of

imaginary points we have for Disney's
Tangled<00:07:47.040> from<00:07:47.550> 3d<00:07:48.030> we<00:07:48.810> I<00:07:49.080> give<00:07:49.620> it<00:07:49.740> 5<00:07:49.920> out<00:07:50.040> of<00:07:50.130> 5

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
Tangled from 3d we I give it 5 out of 5

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.090 
Tangled from 3d we I give it 5 out of 5
what<00:07:50.760> would<00:07:50.850> you<00:07:50.970> give<00:07:51.090> it<00:07:53.570> I<00:07:54.570> give<00:07:55.080> it<00:07:55.200> I<00:07:55.410> give

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.100 
what would you give it I give it I give

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100 
what would you give it I give it I give
it<00:07:56.250> 5<00:07:56.490> out<00:07:56.520> of<00:07:56.820> 5<00:07:57.090> stars<00:07:57.450> as<00:07:57.660> well<00:07:57.810> so<00:07:57.960> I'm<00:07:58.020> gonna

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.110 
it 5 out of 5 stars as well so I'm gonna

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.900 
it 5 out of 5 stars as well so I'm gonna
a<00:07:58.290> verge<00:07:58.500> these<00:07:58.680> two<00:07:58.890> scores<00:07:59.190> and<00:07:59.520> I<00:07:59.670> think

00:07:59.900 --> 00:07:59.910 
a verge these two scores and I think

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.550 
a verge these two scores and I think
that's<00:08:00.060> 5<00:08:00.300> out<00:08:00.480> of<00:08:00.510> 5<00:08:00.720> I<00:08:01.080> don't<00:08:01.380> have<00:08:01.470> my

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 
that's 5 out of 5 I don't have my

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.380 
that's 5 out of 5 I don't have my
calculator<00:08:01.800> with<00:08:02.280> me<00:08:02.460> but<00:08:02.640> that's<00:08:02.760> 5<00:08:03.000> out<00:08:03.180> of<00:08:03.210> 5

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.390 
calculator with me but that's 5 out of 5

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.090 
calculator with me but that's 5 out of 5
