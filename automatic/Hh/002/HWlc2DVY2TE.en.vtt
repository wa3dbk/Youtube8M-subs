00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
other way off well you could put the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.880 
other way off well you could put the
Rockets<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.160> ground<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.699> fire<00:00:26.910> them<00:00:27.180> but

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
Rockets on the ground and fire them but

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.189 
Rockets on the ground and fire them but
that's<00:00:28.890> boring<00:00:29.689> why<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that's boring why would you do that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.910 
that's boring why would you do that
that's<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:33.140> all<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.829> we

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that's like all right so what are we

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
that's like all right so what are we
doing<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.579> doesn't<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:36.270> as

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
doing so this thing doesn't go off as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110 
doing so this thing doesn't go off as
we're<00:00:36.719> plugging<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.460> yeah<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.879> have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
we're plugging it in yeah so we have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
we're plugging it in yeah so we have
built-in<00:00:39.899> on/off<00:00:40.379> switch<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.920> can't<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
built-in on/off switch you can't see it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
built-in on/off switch you can't see it
because<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.879> inside<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
because it's inside here but we have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.240 
because it's inside here but we have
these<00:00:44.899> wires<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.289> running<00:00:46.649> along<00:00:46.770> which

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
these wires that are running along which

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
these wires that are running along which
are<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.239> connected<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.649> motor

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
are going to be connected to the motor

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
are going to be connected to the motor
the<00:00:50.370> engine<00:00:51.000> booster<00:00:51.420> rocket<00:00:52.079> single<00:00:52.469> stage

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the engine booster rocket single stage

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
the engine booster rocket single stage
stuff<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.949> when<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.309> ready<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.760> fire<00:00:57.000> all

stuff and when we are ready to fire all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
stuff and when we are ready to fire all
the<00:00:57.539> line<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.770> where

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.940 
there we're gonna have to check both
these<00:02:46.940> fields<00:02:50.230> hey<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.650> know<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
these fields hey just so you know you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.770 
these fields hey just so you know you
ski<00:02:52.430> your<00:02:52.700> streamers<00:02:53.150> or<00:02:53.510> pieces<00:02:53.720> of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.400 

so<00:03:00.620> one<00:03:00.890> small<00:03:01.010> problem<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.930> looking<00:03:02.930> for

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
so one small problem with looking for

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.090 
so one small problem with looking for
rockets<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.100> cornfield<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:06.100> every

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
rockets in a cornfield is that every

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.190 
rockets in a cornfield is that every
piece<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> corn<00:03:07.940> out<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.420> field<00:03:08.660> kind

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
piece of corn out here in the field kind

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.330 
piece of corn out here in the field kind
of<00:03:09.350> looks<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.770> rocket

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
