00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.280
 In the first crisis 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.089
 The man who penetrated the card stood up 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.149
 Once a week 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.490
 I can not reach it 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.489
 Began to get nervous 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.739
 Shinichi Mori 59 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.980
 1 card 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.820
 During a call 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.890
 There was nothing before or in people 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.240
 Create some difficult conditions 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.400
 More old 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.380
 Opposite 42 I would like to create a situation where the card never breaks 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 Sales of tax increases 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 I knew that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.130
 Betrayed my favorite rugby 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 2 big news 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.240
 The upper price is heavy but I understand 33 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.610
 I brought my card 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 And from now on using the card is a little funny 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.330
 I will show you Matic 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.590
 US chief of law 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 Instead of the father everywhere 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.100
 To stimulate 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.220
 With this card out for the drawing of the same two cards 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 I write my name largely 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.330
 Make this card easier to understand today 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 To the outside corner 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.710
 Take a talker in Rome almost like Takahama, a town torn in Rome 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.709
 Please 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 Please return during the period 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.499
 Because time runs out 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.009
 This hit even eight times 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.639
 I'm looking for a card I chose 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.419
 Too many 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.099
 I look for using a pump 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.499
 I took off here today 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.379
 With this card 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379
 I will expose your chosen card 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.649
 US presidential election 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.379
 Such during this season Western dispersal 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.149
 Please take a close look 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.149
 Please come to Japan again 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.459
 Old 1065 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.429
 What is the foreign capital regulation 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.019
 I got on the other side of the board 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.019
 Quite well done 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.209
 I do not know 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.260
 I can not see the new pearl white, so 13 on the other side 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.009
 There is 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.949
 So from now on 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.759
 Not just found 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.409
 But I will 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.260
 The enthusiasm to make the most of the atmosphere stuck to the school 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.559
 did 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:07.069
 Do you want to take 25 days 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.549
 26th 1132 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.099
 So this card 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.099
 But do 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.319
 2:55 pm 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.319
 Previous drop 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.449
 There is still more 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.159
 Only continue 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.449
 Arose in the rice napster
