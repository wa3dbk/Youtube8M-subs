water just regular water and a drop of

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.640 
water just regular water and a drop of
alcohol<00:04:25.260> for<00:04:26.260> airbrushing<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:28.110> yeah<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.380> just

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
alcohol for airbrushing but yeah I just

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.960 
alcohol for airbrushing but yeah I just
want<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.889> let<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.190> guys<00:04:30.310> know<00:04:30.550> where<00:04:30.760> I'm<00:04:30.820> at
