00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.370
 with youtube friends as they are 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.830
 welcome to a new video of micros 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
 pocket edition guys and in this case it's 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
 a new updated tutorial on how 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 enter the minecraft servers and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 to play mini-games like the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.130
 Hunger Games' skyworks splif and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.369
 soon the world so let's go 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.369
 there 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.879
 why 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.399
 That 's right guys since Michael Pitt 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.260
 updated to version 0 point 11.0 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.540
 many of the owners of the servers 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.550
 they started to update and in this 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.680
 have added new ways of 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.660
 game in addition to renovations in their 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.640
 lobbies including a universal lobby 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.059
 where you can enter all these games 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.129
 with only a good ip address 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.110
 not to be longer this video we are going to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.210
 start let me clarify that these 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.129
 servers are those of live what survival 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.350
 game so if you already have an account 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.330
 registered on these servers is not 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.970
 necessary to make a new one and you can 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.890
 skip that step if it's the first time 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.290
 that you enter these servers will be 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 necessary to create a new account and how 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 this account is created later what 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.860
 we will see first that nothing there is to know 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.049
 how to enter the server and for that the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.180
 first step is to enter minecraft pocket 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.150
 edition remember that they must be in the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.220
 most recent version the 0 point of 11.1 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.680
 so far if there are new 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.110
 versions like 0.11 point 2 and 11 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.939
 points 0.3 something like that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.590
 probably work the same as 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.690
 otherwise I will do a new tutorial 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.300
 so they can be updated and for what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.460
 can enter then guys because 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.100
 we open minecraft the first thing we're going to 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.990
 do is change the default name and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.970
 to do it we have to go to the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.340
 Minecraft settings found 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.620
 in the lower right we touch the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 settings button and there will be a 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.640
 option to change the name 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.770
 usually the name is like steve 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.290
 if you already changed it, it is not necessary 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.420
 change it but if it's steve you'll have it 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.010
 to change to one that you like since 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 that will be the username of your 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.179
 account then you change it and not what 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.400
 forget in case it was erased there was 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.380
 something else then once 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.270
 changed the name let's go back to the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.150
 home page and touch the button 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 play here guys let's play the button 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.590
 from the top right called 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.960
 again we played it and right next 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.050
 a new button with an arrow will appear 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.550
 and one more symbol we play again and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.950
 is here guys where are we going to place 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.900
 all the data and directions to be able 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.240
 enter the server in this case the new 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.160
 server has a universal server on 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.110
 universal server is where you can 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.030
 enter a world and you will see several 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.870
 portals that will take you to the different 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.090
 game modes 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.760
 that's why it's called universal can enter 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.209
 this server in the ip address box 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.170
 you must place the following play point 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.909
 l of sg dot net anyway what 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.530
 I will leave in the description or in this 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.750
 instantly it will appear on the screen 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.879
 so you can better notice what 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.709
 we wrote down and later in the box 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.329
 of the name we put the name that 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.670
 we want can be explain why 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.829
 we will leave it at the port 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.739
 is now only left to touch the 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.599
 Add server button and with this you can 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.280
 enter the universal server now 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.290
 he will simply return them to the menu 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.450
 of the worlds that you have and you add 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.220
 this data correctly you will see that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.410
 the server world is going to change and it's going 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.540
 to have some other colors so 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.209
 to enter we only play it 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.579
 let's load it a little and this guys 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.440
 this is the universal server as 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.120
 can see there are several portals that we 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.090
 will lead to the respective mini-games 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.030
 the hunger games' skyworks split and 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.340
 soon the words however not 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.919
 will let us enter the portals unless 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.389
 we start session so to speak if 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.319
 you already have an account of these servers 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.629

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.519

 diagonal register or good record is what 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.750
 and so we can start to create the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.819
 account to enter the mini-games to 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.250

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.379
 begin most will go through the chests 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.749
 that are in the center of the map 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:04.599
 which contain many things like 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:06.639
 food armor or swords the objective 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.589

 player is on a 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.509
 large platform in different ways 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.029
 it can be a cake, a pizza or 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.129
 simply a great path the goal 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.899
 the goal is to break the ground with 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.849
 tools that they give you so that 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:42.459
 opponents who pass by there are 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.830
 can fall, there are blocks that break them 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.899
 can give you effects for example you 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.999
 can do faster can they do that 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:51.009
 jump higher or you can even 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.839
 make invisible make sure you do 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.309
 several gaps and always keep 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.620
 running to prevent others 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:58.780
 they fit on you and they throw you 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.479
 skyworks the translation into spanish is 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.490
 aerial wars his name comes as in 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.830
 this game mode all the players 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.199
 will be on a small floating island that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.910
 contains several hidden chests 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.070
 the objective is similar to that of the games 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.560
 of hunger however here all the 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.729
 players are on floating islands by 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.740
 what to get to them 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.720
 You must build a bridge with the 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.639
 blocks that give you and you can defeat them 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.650
 on your own island you can also opt 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.360
 by going to the center of the map and take the 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.520
 as many objects 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.860
 they find in the chests there 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.330
 world this game mode is not yet 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.039
 available at the moment 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.050
 they will soon open it but for those who 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.910
 want to know what this is 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.370
 mini game players are divided 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.039
 in teams each team will be locked 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.870
 in one part of the map the map is as if 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.210
 out a normal survival map 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.550
 only that all the equipment will be 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.010
 divided by a large wall when the 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.350
 game start the team must gather the 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.539
 resources needed to be able to equip 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.130
 and make weapons to eliminate the equipment 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.229
 opposite when the numbers 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.360
 disappear to perform all this 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.760
 They should have some time before 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.380
 that the walls fall 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.510

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.310
 mini games just just enter 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.170
 the water portals to take them 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.960
 to the waiting room and they can enter 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.580
