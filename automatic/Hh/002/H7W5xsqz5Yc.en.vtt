00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.490
 a tricky case is the book of 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 17 year old helene hegemann axolotl 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 roadkill all talking about it now only 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.380
 have it all celebrated as the big one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.689
 generation of zero years book 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 now just came out that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 helene hegemann in the book blogger 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.030
 Berlin blogger scene in great detail 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.820
 quoted has quoted very literally 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 then it is spoken of plagiarism 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 why is it celebrated first? 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.600
 so it has the German 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.300
 literature criticism inspires my thesis 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.629
 this book is the 17 year old hegemann 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 is also a book for 40 to 50 for 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.010
 adult written 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 yet it is written in one 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.500
 youth slang in one in one 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.739
 wild jargon stick language 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.860
 her theme is the fate of a boy 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 Woman what probably well, you do not know 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 how largely congruent with hers 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
 own she grows up with a mother 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.420
 the welfare recipient is the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.460
 alcoholic is the quasi before her 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 eyes dies she says i was first 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.740
 socially neglected then I was 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.409
 prosperity then neglected then came 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.750
 her to her father's VolksbÃ¼hnen 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.729
 dramaturg carl hegemann and there she has 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 then she experiences the whole berlin scene 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.890
 really says she is in the quasi 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.280
 berliner folk stage in the in the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 Cafeteria has grown up there and me 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.579
 find 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.500
 from this aesthetic of this popular stage 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.229
 and also this generation 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 I call it time of this destruction cez 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.490
 tdk the book quite a lot 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.090
 she always speaks in the book of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.079
 her father as the back 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 assertive asshole and so on 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.140
 that and he is very angry with 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 I feel it around and drops 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.969
 she also thanks daddy very much that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 actually a young woman is the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.860
 her father and the like 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.600
 postmodern intellectual somehow 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 also very 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.490
 one wants it is her great sorry that 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 is really so after the bussche show 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.790
 your wound it is a single one yes 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.390
 junkie thomes is about drugs it's about 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.370
 sex is about I'm wrong I puke 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.160
 have dizzy spells I'm in one 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.130
 permanent delimitation in a permanent 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 half ecstasy and that word half that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.420
 that is quite a lot 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.030
 The book is very half and wants it too 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.790
 It is half real and it is just 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.920
 also half quote collage it is half in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.330
 a jargon written and half can 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.240
 it is also likely to be said 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.340
 really an authentic what suffering 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 from this it is half in one 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.170
 little seventies flower power and 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.420
 it is also very coquettish violence 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.340
 fantasy where i do not feel where i am 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.990
 Also the feeling from here will be real 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.040
 what is here foreign foreign material 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.110
 asleep and heiner mÃ¼ller said 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.090
 the whole world is material for example 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.310
 it does not cause me any difficulties 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.100
 watching it like a six-year-old 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.750
 in full consciousness at the same time with 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.450
 boiling sulfur the retina 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.550
 burned out and some cock in the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.920
 that's what I think 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.500
 I have to be incredibly coquettish anyway 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.280
 say it is a Hybrid this book 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.770
 hybrid in all its confusion 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.350
 can certainly touch but of course 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.070
 a book which one with mixed feelings 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.070
 read
