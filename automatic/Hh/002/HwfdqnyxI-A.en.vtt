00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.880
 hi friends good morning everyone e 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.410
 welcome to this new appointment of 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.630
 technical and maintenance 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.699
 we continue with the vein of the gods 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.080
 switching power supplies reversing bar e 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:22.810
 let's intervene with this sport 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.170
 I will show you a note for a moment 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.060
 inverter not from start to finish 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.680
 hand repair during there are 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.350
 some considerations 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.030
 scott to give you and I think it is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.410
 important and make them immediately enjoy the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.950
 filmed and then we do two 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.950
 considerations 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.989
 here is more than a video lesson 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:52.730
 integral wants to be a scoop 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.160
 flash is taken from a repair that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.030
 among other things it is not yet completed then 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.940
 this is an inverter first given 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.640
 the criticality of the conditions of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.819
 use of inverters often 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.549
 companies apply to the printed circuit board 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.899
 welded and finished a layer of paint 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.749
 this layer of paint though paul 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.590
 in fact deceive you by placing the 

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:23.450
 tips on tinned bands often not 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 they mark nothing precisely because instead of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 touching the pond you are performing la 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.919
 measurement on the on the layer of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.490
 flatting that clearly a material 

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:37.549
 insulating 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.919
 specifically in this inverter 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:49.279
 keep jumping and shows ok 

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:52.999
 exit muskets working I saw 

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:56.060
 that there are several false contacts in 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:59.299
 plus there was a short circuit in the middle 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.309
 here because by dint of stagnating the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.049
 tracks or with a previous one 

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:10.410
 repair not so lucky had 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.250
 made a tin bridge contact 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.450
 I recommend it when clearly not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.900
 will be at the first try however when the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.250
 defect becomes chronic and not continuous 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.310
 to make the displays stand out as well see 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.400
 that you are unable to deduce the cause 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.340
 of the problem went fishing because 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.530
 the problem is often in these 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.770
 tinned areas in these tinned areas 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.960
 which are made to increase the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.110
 current range of the individual tracks 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.870
 often the components inside yes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.370
 then heat up both bind the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.010
 components inside don't 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.310
 contact and therefore the track does not come 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.060
 absolutely served by energy 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.530
 so it is good practice at this point to do 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.740
 in this way as I did 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.890
 clearly always remember to do or 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.780
 a scan at 600 dpi 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.209
 of the whole area front back side 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.820
 component born welds or if not 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.570
 another of the photographs just because then 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.850
 when you go to dismount everything 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.140
 sure that eventually you will succeed in 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.620
 reassemble it and does not mean sometimes 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.440
 the experience has nothing to do with it 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.670
 wait and less times and distraction 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.270
 behind the corner 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.180
 so what do you have to do free with 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.420
 soldering station the tracks from everything 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.360
 the pond in the first place is way 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.160
 win any feet there that don't 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.120
 contact me in this tab I have 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.340
 found 3 4 and more especially when 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.670
 current currents come into play 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.250
 big and important currents here 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.720
 they cause this type of extra anomaly 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.940
 you will remove all the oxidized tracks from the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.280
 from the card in such a way as to be able to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.549
 be sure of a happy contact 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.079
 once you have put everything back in 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.590
 function that 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:27.389
 the inverter will return to this mode 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:32.330
 point you can extend with a spray of 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:36.120
 insulating paint again a mantle of 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.629
 insulation in fact ok ok 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.969
 Next good day to miss up 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:45.419
 here is just a few sparkling spots 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:50.819
 minutes but just enough to be 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.979
 prize for useful things for yours 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:56.610
 repairs I remind you in terms of 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.080
 contact whatsapp for short answers

 switching power supplies that fail 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.900
 to repair you can send them in 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:27.960
 repair to the address you have 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.120
 I will indicate via whatsapp instead for how much 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.860

 genius on www.amazon.com before sending 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.639
 the cards instead for the other type of 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.719
 I recommend first of all support 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:04.139
 to fix and repair them remember 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.110
 to take pictures or better still of the 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.690
 beautiful scans at 600 dpi of 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.060
 beyond the welding act and the component side 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.460
 maniata the keys a historian you have 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.360
 an image of how the card was before 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.699
 that someone put their hands in it is 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.979
 important is important because sometimes 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.289
 it happens that during a repair it jumps 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.560
 the component comes off the wire yes 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:31.980
 detach the cable rather than 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.230
 it burns and the integrated circuit e 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.150
 therefore it is no longer possible to and win 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:41.970
 the code with this this image 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.160
 saved at least we try to preserve ourselves 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.330
 from this type of risk considered 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.090
 that I do it too with mine 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.760
 experience I don't touch any card if 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.970
 before I have not photographed it so it is 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.169
 good practice to do this 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.930
 to avoid unpleasantness of anything because 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:06.020
 then if a card should come to me 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:09.720
 which it is impossible to infer 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.729
 at least even just a component is not 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.770
 can repair more then I have to postpone 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.520
 back unexplained then and it's ugly 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.880
 because often the schemes do not succeed 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.050
 to find on the net so I recommend it 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.760
 have this foresight 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.280
 such that it can be protected and succeeded 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.930
 however to finish the repair 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.640
 Having said this, I greet you and refer you to 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.260
 next appointments maximum not even 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.260
 have a nice day guys
