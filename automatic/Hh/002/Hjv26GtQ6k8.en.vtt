00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.740
 play the minecraft 1.7 point 2 online on 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.690
 line and the server is in two ways like 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.060
 You will see in the previous video I will 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.480

 You want this game go to my channel for the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.070
 previous video to this there you can

 find the minecraft ok well let's 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.470

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.470
 we will open in 8 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.329
 to open the game 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.659
 I remember that I remember that the version 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.239
 is 1.7 point 2 but you can play in the 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.690
 lunch in any version by editing the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.690
 profile 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.380
 very well 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.320

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.110
 let's go to a player 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.810
 if you want to play with a friend in your 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.090
 good world so if you give a player to 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.090
 your world play the selected world 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.770
 this assuming you have another friend 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.759
 with another pc 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.210
 we will go to the interface and open 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.210
 the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.900
 and this number that we see here below 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.580

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.240
 we have to give to our 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.240
 friend and him 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.900
 will have to go to multiplayer 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.590

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.820
 as I did here 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.080
 larger minecraft networks like the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.620
 400 that fit and well there is a connection 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.960

 you will not move anything in the direction of 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.830
 server based to copy the ips that I 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.270
 I'm going to leave you below this video and with 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 control 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.570
 I do not remember in snow I think it's seems to me 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.910
 you are going to paste the here and you will give ready 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.620
 immediately they will leave you going to 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.830
 come out something like this 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.000
 and by double clicking you will be able to enter and 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.040
 play online ok 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.110
 here the game is going to ask you to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.730
 register the only thing you're going to do that 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:18.860
 to do is press the letter t 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:23.330
 put this the diagonal login 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.700
 put a password for example lobito 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.490
 and again I repeated your password on 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 lobito give enter and it will be registered ok 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.120
 obviously the habit is not my password 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.130
 but well that's how I show it to you 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.860
 if you take a lot of percent you can not 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.130
 register and good try it 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.710
