00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
hi this is Gary boss from audio-technica

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.480 
hi this is Gary boss from audio-technica
explaining<00:00:13.200> some<00:00:13.469> microphone<00:00:13.980> techniques

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
explaining some microphone techniques

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.609 
explaining some microphone techniques
and<00:00:14.700> tips<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:15.150> pro<00:00:15.570> audio<00:00:15.780> land<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.500> right

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and tips with pro audio land and right

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.750 
and tips with pro audio land and right
now<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> talk<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> three

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
now we're going to talk about the three

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.810 
now we're going to talk about the three
to<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.090> rule<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> quite<00:00:19.500> simply<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.580> three

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to one rule and quite simply the three

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.900 
to one rule and quite simply the three
to<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.480> rule<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.410> basic<00:00:23.010> rule<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> thumb

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to one rule is a basic rule of thumb

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.269 
to one rule is a basic rule of thumb
when<00:00:24.119> using<00:00:24.359> multiple<00:00:24.930> mics<00:00:25.109> let's<00:00:25.859> say<00:00:26.070> we

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
when using multiple mics let's say we

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.480 
when using multiple mics let's say we
have<00:00:26.580> backup<00:00:27.539> singers<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> microphone

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
have backup singers we have a microphone

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.530 
have backup singers we have a microphone
here<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> microphone<00:00:31.410> over<00:00:31.769> here

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
here and we have a microphone over here

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
here and we have a microphone over here
okay<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:35.040> certain

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
okay what we want to do is make certain

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.250 
okay what we want to do is make certain
that<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> distance<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> second

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that the distance to the second

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.190 
that the distance to the second
microphone<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:39.120> times<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.020> distance

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
microphone is three times the distance

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.100 
microphone is three times the distance
to<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.800> singer<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.300> am<00:00:42.420> six<00:00:42.809> inches

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to this singer so if I am six inches

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
to this singer so if I am six inches
away<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.370> singer<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
away here for my first singer I have to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
away here for my first singer I have to
be<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.750> least<00:00:45.930> eighteen<00:00:46.710> inches<00:00:47.010> away<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
be at least eighteen inches away to this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
be at least eighteen inches away to this
microphone<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.079> gets<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.530> crazy

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
microphone now this gets really crazy

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
microphone now this gets really crazy
let's<00:00:50.309> say<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.640> singing<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> foot

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
let's say I'm singing back here a foot

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
let's say I'm singing back here a foot
away<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.219> three<00:00:53.579> feet<00:00:53.820> away

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
away now I have to be three feet away

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
away now I have to be three feet away
okay<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.410> comes<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.860> play<00:00:55.949> also

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
okay this really comes into play also

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
okay this really comes into play also
when<00:00:56.640> miking<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> choir<00:00:57.449> again<00:00:58.079> oh<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
when miking a choir again oh the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
when miking a choir again oh the
tendency<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> put<00:00:59.969> more<00:01:00.239> microphones<00:01:00.600> up

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
tendency is to put more microphones up

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450 
tendency is to put more microphones up
so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.530> coverage<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.280> just

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so you get more coverage and that just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
so you get more coverage and that just
causes<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.210> kinds<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> problems<00:01:03.870> from

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
causes you all kinds of problems from

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
causes you all kinds of problems from
phaz<00:01:04.799> problems<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.260> essentially<00:01:07.260> if<00:01:07.409> you're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
phaz problems so essentially if you're

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
phaz problems so essentially if you're
making<00:01:07.710> acquired<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.369> lot<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> times<00:01:08.760> people

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
making acquired a lot of times people

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
making acquired a lot of times people
hang<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> microphones<00:01:10.110> over<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> choir<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hang the microphones over the choir and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
hang the microphones over the choir and
you're<00:01:11.520> maybe<00:01:11.640> three<00:01:12.150> feet<00:01:12.390> away<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you're maybe three feet away from the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
you're maybe three feet away from the
closest<00:01:13.890> singer<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> choir<00:01:14.670> group<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.930> want

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
closest singer in a choir group you want

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.499 
closest singer in a choir group you want
to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.259> nine<00:01:16.650> feet<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> next<00:01:17.970> microphone

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to be nine feet to the next microphone

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
to be nine feet to the next microphone
the<00:01:19.110> reason<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.700> phased

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the reason for this is is phased

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
the reason for this is is phased
problems<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:21.930> gonna<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> little

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
problems and we're gonna do a little

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.039 
problems and we're gonna do a little
demo<00:01:22.770> four-phase<00:01:23.369> problem<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:24.840> so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
demo four-phase problem right now so

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
demo four-phase problem right now so
we're<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.259> switch<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.130> two

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
we're gonna switch to these two

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
we're gonna switch to these two
microphones<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.329> two<00:01:30.570> microphones

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
microphones so these two microphones

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
microphones so these two microphones
should<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
should be on now what I'm gonna do is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
should be on now what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.060> make<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> noise<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.920> kind

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I'm gonna make a noise that's just kind

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.120 
I'm gonna make a noise that's just kind
of<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> steady<00:01:36.030> droning<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.009> gonna

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
of a steady droning and you're gonna

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.039 
of a steady droning and you're gonna
hear<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> difference<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> audio<00:01:39.750> quality

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
hear a difference in the audio quality

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
hear a difference in the audio quality
and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.770> why<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> do

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and this is why you don't want to do

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.460 
and this is why you don't want to do
this<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.240> microphones

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.510 

we'll<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.590> again<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.950> other<00:01:50.040> way

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.560 

essentially<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:56.970> example<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
essentially that's an example of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.369 
essentially that's an example of
acoustic<00:01:58.020> phase<00:01:58.200> interference<00:01:58.710> Thanks
