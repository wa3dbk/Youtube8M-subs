00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:42.280 

over<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.979> massive<00:01:20.580> stages

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.700 

then<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.410> went<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.650> after<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.190> way<00:01:44.340> yes

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
then we went out after this in way yes

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
then we went out after this in way yes
we<00:01:46.710> were<00:01:46.860> supposed<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.600> idea<00:01:48.900> was<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.080> we

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
we were supposed to the idea was that we

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480 
we were supposed to the idea was that we
would<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> couple<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.980> days<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.400> really

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
would take a couple of days and really

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
would take a couple of days and really
kind<00:01:50.760> of<00:01:50.910> focus<00:01:51.690> on<00:01:51.870> these<00:01:52.020> shows<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.490> take<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
kind of focus on these shows and take it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.220 
kind of focus on these shows and take it
easy<00:01:53.730> because<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.300> on<00:01:54.480> tour<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.870> long

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
easy because we are on tour for a long

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.100 
easy because we are on tour for a long
time<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.180> do<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.390> keep<00:01:57.510> sup<00:01:57.750> healthy

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
time and do you have to keep sup healthy

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.040 
time and do you have to keep sup healthy
so<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.740> idea<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.160> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.670> not<00:02:00.510> really

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
so the idea was kind of just not really

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.350 
so the idea was kind of just not really
like<00:02:01.530> drink<00:02:01.830> too<00:02:01.980> much<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.340> piety<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
like drink too much or piety hard and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.510 
like drink too much or piety hard and
just<00:02:03.480> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> take<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.200> easy<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.710> don't<00:02:05.430> have

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
just kind of take it easy I don't have

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.999
