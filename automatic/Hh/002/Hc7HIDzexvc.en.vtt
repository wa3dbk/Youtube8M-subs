00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
so here we have the code keyboard in all

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.450 
so here we have the code keyboard in all
of<00:02:05.960> its<00:02:06.110> glory<00:02:06.380> I'll<00:02:06.590> just<00:02:06.740> position<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.310> the

I<00:02:17.560> ordered<00:02:18.560> some<00:02:18.709> bonus<00:02:19.220> keys<00:02:19.820> as<00:02:20.209> well

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.750

replacement system keys and audio keys
I'll<00:02:26.420> just<00:02:26.600> zoom<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> little<00:02:27.260> bit<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.680> you

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
I'll just zoom in a little bit so you

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.580 
I'll just zoom in a little bit so you
can<00:02:27.920> see<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.160> key<00:02:28.459> font<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.209> close<00:02:29.540> my<00:02:30.170> camera

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:40.140 
can see the key font up close my camera
will<00:02:30.739> refocus<00:02:36.010> nope<00:02:37.010> doesn't<00:02:37.250> want<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.550> you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.180 

know<00:02:41.150> put<00:02:41.390> some<00:02:41.420> casing<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.140> bit<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
know put some casing here a bit so the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.320 
know put some casing here a bit so the
action<00:02:46.489> feels<00:02:48.130> reasonably<00:02:49.130> bouncy<00:02:49.670> I'm<00:02:50.090> not

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
action feels reasonably bouncy I'm not

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.229 
action feels reasonably bouncy I'm not
exactly<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.750> keyboard<00:02:51.230> nerd<00:02:51.500> but<00:02:52.000> they<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.060> feel

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
exactly a keyboard nerd but they do feel

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.660 
exactly a keyboard nerd but they do feel
pretty<00:02:53.510> good

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
pretty good

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.130 
pretty good
it's<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.880> reason<00:02:56.180> with<00:02:56.450> lab<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> wouldn't

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
it's the reason with lab that I wouldn't

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.360 
it's the reason with lab that I wouldn't
say<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.440> like<00:02:59.049> you<00:03:00.049> know<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.950> scare

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
you an idea of thickness that's how

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:19.440 
you an idea of thickness that's how
thick<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.900> rear<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.739> keyboard<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
thick is the rear of the keyboard and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.580 
thick is the rear of the keyboard and
got<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.570> feet<00:03:25.239> also<00:03:26.239> here<00:03:26.720> are<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> switches

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
got your feet also here are the switches

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.350 
got your feet also here are the switches
um<00:03:28.489> just<00:03:29.150> let<00:03:29.450> me<00:03:29.600> see<00:03:29.810> if<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.989> can<00:03:30.200> zoom<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:32.180> a

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
um just let me see if I can zoom in a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:42.960 
um just let me see if I can zoom in a
little<00:03:32.570> bit

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.340 

I<00:03:47.970> don't<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.030> how<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.180> do<00:03:49.360> manual<00:03:49.840> zooming

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
I don't know how to do manual zooming

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.070 
I don't know how to do manual zooming
apparently<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.450> did<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> switches<00:03:52.870> where<00:03:53.020> I

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
apparently I did the switches where I

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.490 
apparently I did the switches where I
think<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.470> can<00:03:53.620> change<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:54.130> example<00:03:55.500> whether

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
think you can change for example whether

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.320 
think you can change for example whether
you<00:03:56.590> want<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.800> use<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.400> command<00:03:58.030> key<00:03:58.300> on

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
you want to use like the command key on

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.410 
you want to use like the command key on
a<00:03:58.510> Mac<00:03:58.810> or<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.140> control<00:03:59.650> key<00:03:59.860> on<00:03:59.920> Windows

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
a Mac or the control key on Windows

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.340 
a Mac or the control key on Windows
which<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> instruction<00:04:02.170> booklet

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
which is the instruction booklet

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.470 
which is the instruction booklet
referred<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:05.100> there's<00:04:06.100> my<00:04:06.250> cat<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:07.360> can

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
referred to and there's my cat you can

get out of the wing yes so that's the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.190 
get out of the wing yes so that's the
code<00:04:12.010> keyboard<00:04:12.780> unboxed<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.930> know<00:04:14.020> all<00:04:14.110> of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
code keyboard unboxed you know all of

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.320 
code keyboard unboxed you know all of
its<00:04:14.290> glory

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
its glory

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:30.420 
its glory
yeah<00:04:16.330> that's<00:04:17.290> kind<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.010> guess<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:30.130> just

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
yeah that's kind of it I guess so just

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
to give you an idea of what the code

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.240 
to give you an idea of what the code
keyboard<00:04:32.830> looks<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.280> with<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:34.120> desk<00:04:34.390> set<00:04:34.690> up

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
keyboard looks like with a desk set up

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.040 
keyboard looks like with a desk set up
here<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.340> is

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
here it is

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.150 
here it is
it<00:04:38.050> was<00:04:38.170> my<00:04:38.350> 27-inch<00:04:39.250> Dell<00:04:39.970> IPS<00:04:40.450> monitor<00:04:41.160> now

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
it was my 27-inch Dell IPS monitor now

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.900 
it was my 27-inch Dell IPS monitor now
as<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.400> can<00:04:42.460> see<00:04:42.520> it's<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.790> wired<00:04:43.150> keyboard

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
as you can see it's a wired keyboard

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.220 
as you can see it's a wired keyboard
it's<00:04:45.910> not<00:04:46.030> really<00:04:46.210> ideal<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.750> don't<00:04:46.990> think<00:04:47.169> I

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
it's not really ideal I don't think I

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.600 
it's not really ideal I don't think I
would<00:04:47.350> prefer<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.620> wireless<00:04:48.100> version<00:04:48.250> but

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
would prefer a wireless version but

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.890 
would prefer a wireless version but
obviously<00:04:48.880> that's<00:04:49.150> not<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.330> priority<00:04:49.780> for

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
obviously that's not a priority for

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.370 
obviously that's not a priority for
these<00:04:50.020> mechanical<00:04:50.560> keyboard<00:04:51.070> manufacturers

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
these mechanical keyboard manufacturers

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.370 
these mechanical keyboard manufacturers
this<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.590> with<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.770> backlight<00:04:54.430> on<00:04:55.140> you<00:04:56.140> can

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
this is it with the backlight on you can

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.960 
this is it with the backlight on you can
adjust<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:58.630> backlight<00:04:59.140> as<00:04:59.350> well<00:04:59.730> using<00:05:00.730> the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
adjust the backlight as well using the

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.730 
adjust the backlight as well using the
function<00:05:01.540> keys<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:05.140> if<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:05.320> want<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.530> turn

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
function keys and so if you want to turn

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.610 
function keys and so if you want to turn
up<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.100> backlight<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:07.110> think<00:05:08.110> I'm<00:05:08.290> afraid<00:05:08.500> we

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
up the backlight I think I'm afraid we

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.870 
up the backlight I think I'm afraid we
can<00:05:08.710> see<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.040> coming<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.400> run<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.640> camera

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
can see that coming to run the camera

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880 
can see that coming to run the camera
but<00:05:10.470> there<00:05:11.470> are<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.560> bunch<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:11.830> different

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
but there are a bunch of different

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.890 
but there are a bunch of different
backlight<00:05:12.490> settings<00:05:12.850> one<00:05:13.300> thing<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.570> note<00:05:13.750> is

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
backlight settings one thing to note is

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.380 
backlight settings one thing to note is
that<00:05:14.070> apparently<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.430> backlight<00:05:15.910> doesn't

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
that apparently the backlight doesn't

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.070 
that apparently the backlight doesn't
work<00:05:17.669> on<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.820> media<00:05:19.030> keys<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.600> can<00:05:19.690> see<00:05:19.870> below

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
work on the media keys you can see below

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.790 
work on the media keys you can see below
the<00:05:20.440> home<00:05:21.070> page<00:05:21.430> up<00:05:21.669> page<00:05:22.540> down<00:05:22.600> and<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.650> those

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
the home page up page down and all those

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.870 
the home page up page down and all those
kids<00:05:23.980> would<00:05:24.100> have<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:24.280> have<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:24.490> call<00:05:24.730> them

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
kids would have you have to call them

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.290 
kids would have you have to call them
there<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.690> also<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.140> a<00:05:29.310> series<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.400> miyuki<00:05:30.880> icons

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
there is also a a series of miyuki icons

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.560 
there is also a a series of miyuki icons
which<00:05:31.540> work<00:05:31.780> but<00:05:32.380> they<00:05:32.680> are<00:05:32.710> not<00:05:32.830> backlit

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
which work but they are not backlit

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.720 
which work but they are not backlit
which<00:05:34.570> is<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.840> shame<00:05:36.510> but<00:05:37.510> there<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.260> is

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
which is a shame but there it is

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.900 
which is a shame but there it is
switched<00:05:39.730> on<00:05:40.560> looks<00:05:41.560> quite<00:05:41.919> neat<00:05:44.580> yeah<00:05:45.580> so

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
switched on looks quite neat yeah so

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.640 
switched on looks quite neat yeah so
that's<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.450> code<00:05:46.660> keyboard<00:05:49.140> I've<00:05:50.140> tested<00:05:50.590> out

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
that's the code keyboard I've tested out

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.440 
that's the code keyboard I've tested out
for<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:50.950> while<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.160> see<00:05:51.430> what<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.120> think<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.360> it

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
for a while to see what I think of it

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.390 
for a while to see what I think of it
but<00:05:52.660> certainly<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.680> does<00:05:53.830> look<00:05:53.979> very<00:05:54.010> needs

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
but certainly it does look very needs

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.270 
but certainly it does look very needs
very<00:05:54.640> nice<00:05:54.820> very<00:05:55.090> clean

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
very nice very clean

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.620 
very nice very clean
and<00:05:57.830> certainly<00:05:58.830> on<00:05:59.100> my<00:05:59.340> first<00:05:59.670> glance<00:06:00.300> it

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
and certainly on my first glance it

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.590 
and certainly on my first glance it
looks<00:06:00.840> pretty<00:06:01.380> good
