 welcome to the message 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.770
 Japan won sprinkler heads at the court case and I have 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.690
 always 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.919
 picking up 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.919
 for example your mother can 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.650
 it sounds like that 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.759
 Yes 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.169
 is right 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.939
 There are 4 open text 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.830
 ms 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.830
 already 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
 I have to be too 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 Amsterdam 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 again last year 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 3 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 from boxtel 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 well i'm going to work this coming week 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 are 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.930
 it just depends on what belief you have 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 always needed 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.200
 2 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 also turn 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 answer that you make the ride out of wooden as much as possible 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.390
 you start scraping 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.010
 it is indeed a spear of clercq 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.330
 but well preserved 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
 makes it fun 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.190
 usually or you are going to pass a child it's time to grab hands 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.469
 it may take days how do you finish 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.900
 the other parties rose on Thursday 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
 no matter how well your hands fit 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.759
 I'm going to be a strong man from assen 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.779
 apply the scraping 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.189
 I see each one up
