00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.260
 alternates 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.190
 at the beginning my withme with a touch up 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.680
 of a trick so I put the concealer 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.880
 where needed after agricultural studio fix 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:30.020
 of the mucke with the foundation sponge 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.419
 that I love and I apply it 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.800
 also on the mobile eyelids that in short 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.300
 during the day be a little bit 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.410
 polished to have a base 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 homogeneous 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.480
 then he went to his eyebrows then 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.520
 after combing them I go to fill them 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.710
 with the eyebrow pencil of the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.429
 well what i'm good enough with 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.429
 well 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.870
 now switch to eye makeup and I take 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.160
 a black pencil always of the good cons 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.829
 and I really recommend this too 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.840
 I got it on the site here is green and I go 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.790
 to put a little on the eyelid 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.740
 mobile while remaining attached to the line 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.009
 of the eyelashes and after that go to fade it 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.810
 with a small brush and try to do a little 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.610
 the external tongue as if it were a 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 eyeliner so as to lengthen the look 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.090
 with my favorite nike palette 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.250
 I take the color is the second color 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.810
 now I don't remember the name and that 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.120
 just a shimmering bomber I go to 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.700
 create light points under the lights 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.190
 eyebrows and inside corner 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.960
 eye 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.660
 I always prefer to use more 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.020
 fingers than brushes I am not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.640
 better 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.130
 then I go to get the first one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.040
 color of the naked which is always the same 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.270
 a light color but less shimmer and lo 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.210
 I'm going to apply over the entire eyelid 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.280
 movable so as to fade out a little bit in 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.530
 black in this case I do not go to 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.420
 apply mascara because I made one 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.060
 semi-lengthening of the eyelashes then 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.890
 they are already long, but then curved 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.780
 to complete eye make-up with 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 a black pencil inside the eyes 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.830
 always that of goodness so 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.310
 true to apply of the earth I know 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.110
 that does not 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.650
 he replies so but I apply it on the whole 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.150
 face because I like to have an effect 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.280
 homogeneous on the whole face in the bars or if 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.550
 in the most little after that I go to 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 put the blush of the chrism givenchy 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:43.880
 because precisely this our rosÃ© 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:46.370
 on the cheeks then moving on to 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.220
 lips after carefully hydrating them with 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.110
 this lip balm of Rilastil give to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.170
 create the lip contour with this 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.750
 pencil sucking nov of the essence that me 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.090
 really like it a lot and applying first 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.819
 the lip balm is very thick 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.560
 easier also because besides doing the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.569
 burgundy I am going to fill even the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.690
 lips so that my lipstick lasts 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.690
 more 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.920
 obviously this color goes a little bit 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.659
 the lipstick that is the pink floyd of the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.180
 mucke that I bought from 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.610
 however the effect is very little 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.840
 it lasted much longer also because I was 7 mar 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.329
 and therefore the duration is assured 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.689
 result therefore a pink tending a little 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.329
 make-up is complicated and mauve 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.760
 so now I take care of the hair bar or 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.120
 simply combing them with your hands 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.489
 so as not to flatten them too much e 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.079
 precisely on the swollen finish a little 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.079
 on glues with hands always 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.380
 the street I'm about to show you a 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.150
 outfit that was created for a 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.460
 aperitif in particular wanted 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.860
 wear this sweater dressed in wool 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.720
 which I am worshiping to the madness of 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.280
 this beautiful dark blue covered 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.320
 fully of the brand 's sequins 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.860
 my wish as well as being very effective 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.300
 and also very very hot indeed it is one 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.760
 of the sweaters that brought me also to 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.440
 new york and the color drives me crazy then 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.590
 all these sequins confer a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.420
 lot of light to the total look in the part 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.310
 lower put these fake woods 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.040
 faux leather a little python skin of 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.450
 last season's calzedonia 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.800
 finally my feet completed it all 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 with my usual biker boots 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.020
 the look there are these earrings by 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.270
 joy that with the technique on touch that 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.270
 they are very bright and luminous 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.470
 next time a big kiss hello
