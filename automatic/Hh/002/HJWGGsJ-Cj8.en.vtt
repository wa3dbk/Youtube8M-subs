00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the right hand so we have this with this

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:00.810 
the right hand so we have this with this
chord<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.770> AED<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.150> be

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.130 

then<00:03:01.820> we<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.510> go<00:03:02.630> up<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.960> an<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.470> an<00:03:03.800> addy<00:03:04.840> so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.260 

and<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.520> just<00:03:10.670> play<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.970> chord

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
and then you just play this chord

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:19.710 
and then you just play this chord
separately<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:11.960> this<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.270> F<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.890> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.980 

so

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.710 

and<00:03:26.200> for<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.430> higher<00:03:27.880> octave<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.390> still<00:03:28.600> play

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
and for the higher octave you still play

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:39.620 
and for the higher octave you still play
the<00:03:28.840> same<00:03:29.020> thing<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:37.270> then<00:03:37.840> when<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.440> go<00:03:38.650> to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the same thing and then when you go to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.430 
the same thing and then when you go to
you<00:03:40.630> go<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.650> e<00:03:42.280> energy<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.790> go<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.440> sharp

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
you go to a e energy and go to a sharp

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:59.259 
you go to a e energy and go to a sharp
ergy<00:03:48.400> sharp<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.790> think<00:03:49.110> so

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:10.220 

and<00:04:00.269> then<00:04:00.510> what<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.830> do<00:04:01.950> after

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.849 

and<00:04:11.230> then<00:04:11.409> you<00:04:11.890> go<00:04:12.040> back<00:04:12.069> to<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.700> chord<00:04:13.859> the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
and then you go back to this chord the

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:30.150 
and then you go back to this chord the
sudden<00:04:15.159> you<00:04:15.189> do<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.900> then<00:04:29.289> you<00:04:29.919> want<00:04:30.009> to

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
sudden you do that and then you want to

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:57.570 
sudden you do that and then you want to
go<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.729> this<00:04:31.000> this<00:04:31.660> right<00:04:31.870> here<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:57.130> it's

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
go like this this right here so so it's

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:07.370 
go like this this right here so so it's
pretty<00:04:57.729> much<00:04:57.849> simple

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.909 

you

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.099 

there<00:05:12.919> it<00:05:13.009> is
