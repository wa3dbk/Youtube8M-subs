is known and this is how you craft this
in<00:01:18.330> fact<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.990> might<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.770> Sam<00:01:20.580> stone

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.469 
in fact it might even be Sam stone
instead<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.939> yeah<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.210> it's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
instead of thing yeah there we go it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
instead of thing yeah there we go it's
sandstone<00:01:24.960> baby<00:01:25.920> pardon<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> there's<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
sandstone baby pardon and there's the
