00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.160
 single health system began to perform surgeries for the reduction of 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.329
 stomach in 2001 in these eight years the country registered an increase of over 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.599
 500 percent in performing the procedure that radically changes the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.459
 life of the patient 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.300
 but even with this increase in total demand for operated patients it is still 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 very small when compared to the number of obese people in the country 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.400
 it's not just a matter of aesthetics, the name itself says 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.319
 morbid obesity is a serious disease that can kill 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.390
 oftentimes 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 the only way out is to reduce the size of the stomach by means of a surgery one 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.190
 of the most used techniques is the placement of a kind of ring in 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.060
 back of the stomach 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.429
 in dividing the organ 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.749
 leaving a very small part to receive the race from 2001 to here 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.960
 surgeries performed through the 

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:57.269
 increased by 542 per cent from the redetv 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.320
 in Brazil but worldwide 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.290
 and we had a recession of access also in Brazil here we got 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.040
 fortunately the day in the last two years is unquestionably knowledge 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560
 very good 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.630
 but we're still in a very small world 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 operators of two thousand and 500 patients for a year by sus is whimsy I know 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 than the number of patients with morbid obesity and need to be operated on for 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 do the surgery it is necessary to undergo a rigorous evaluation 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.609
 besides having the weight considered dangerous 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.649
 or serious diseases related to obesity 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.020
 the patient must exist to lose weight 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 by means of diets medicines that physical exercises only when nothing gives 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.050
 Yes, surgery is allowed. 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.509
 and Ana did the operation with a private physician ' 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.520
 he who had a heart attack 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.100
 she had hypertension after surgery and debated the assets in 4 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 months 3 weeks and 18 kilos in two months I think the programs all years 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.000
 That i had 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850
 after pressure 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.830
 reopened 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.240
 were cut 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.700
 in a way think of leaving the house pink according to the cnt should after 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.529
 thinking about doing the surgery just is not enough 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.260
 the doctors say that for the right treatment 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 it is necessary to adopt healthier habits and follow up 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.200
 surveillance specialists 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.489
 with the clinician 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.549
 or for administrative use also with the psychologist is very important this 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.540
 to wait 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.439
 potentiates and optimizes the use of surgery 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.769
 if the patient is lucky, there may be 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.590
 and plays its own process 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.379
 and there are people coming
