00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.410
 how about everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.530
 explain well I will not explain myself 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.760
 I always say I will explain such a thing 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:15.100
 I'm going to talk about him 3 x 3 x 4 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.760
 you will not give us that is enough 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 little one will be able to observe my hands and it is 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.509
 quite small 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.180
 because because this is a minimum cube 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.150
 apart from that it's a mini cube I did 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.129
 a modification had already spoken in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.040
 another video that was going to show my other 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:38.879
 modifications and then this is the moment 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.629
 to prove the no I 'm going to make a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.210
 video of each modification for example 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.280
 double the three times four times five 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.720
 a video of three by four or five 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.699
 I have a three by three by four 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.860
 modified can speak three by three 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.750
 for four I will talk about other 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 modifications ones that I liked 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.720
 some that I did not like and then things 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 I really liked that stress for 4 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 by 5 because here we can see if 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 tour super well here it was super good and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.960
 here it does not turn because it does not turn because I 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.369
 I took the blue cape 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.369
 this is a layer 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.350
 then I took all the blue cloak and the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.840
 I hit bone I took the whole layer of a cube 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.970
 if this is a normal cube I took a layer 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.810
 and I glued on top of another layer 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.210
 and that's the way it turns blue usually because I 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.760
 I like blue and it's not my color 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 preferred but I like blue 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.770
 and here we can observe the modification 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 of the approach 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.140
 love focus 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.140
 and here we can observe 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.680
 and here we can observe the in the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.990
 slight scratches here we can observe 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.100
 that this was once an edge here 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.730
 we can observe these these edges here 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 that are as strange as these were 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.160
 corners 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.220
 and they serve and that's the way it is for everyone 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.910
 only this layer 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.910
 let's do this trick here 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.830
 I'm here 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.830
 let's do it in this cube 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.500
 it's a little complicated to do so 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 it would not be left in a pretty way 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.209
 rare then I really liked this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.250
 modification and good 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.310
 they will be saying good and what are you waiting for 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.400
 to undo it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.069
 want pretty good 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.959
 and we are going to undo what we are going to do 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.959
 twists so yes 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.909
 this course is deformed I love it when 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.909
 the cubes at the beginning are normal and 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.879
 that one after a modification 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:28.540
 have the power to train them not because it is 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:33.660
 one is quite curious that one the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.850
 uniform bench although totally deformed 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.850
 and so it remains in its undone form 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.310
 will be that I solve it if we go we are going to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.190
 solve it then first I start by 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.840
 the for the longest piece as I already 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.970
 had explained in 3 by 4 by 5 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.800
 we start with the piece that stands out 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.770
 is this we are going to make the cross 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.770
 then so according to the cross 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.400
 something that I forgot to comment on 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.900
 previous videos or if you already know 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:15.010
 I did not apply the beginners method 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.320
 I know not all advanced methods 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.710
 but silver 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.090
 I am golden and my friend best friend of 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:27.430
 silver he knows more cases and then I 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.340
 I said good because you know what 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.540
 know then you should also 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.640
 participate in the videos the cause for the 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.150
 which he not to him 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.980
 the casino makes videos is because good not 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.740
 has made videos only the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.680
 presentation that he has appeared and is 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.080
 for him it is why he he is very busy 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.940
 and well it is then you 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.400
 then you do not do anything not like that 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.330
 I also have things to do but not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.720
 so many things to do as he 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.729
 then that's why he almost did not 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.699
 appears in the videos does not appear 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.740
 practically and I'm good because I have more 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.479
 time apart from that I am the one 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.060
 I have the camera and all that then 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.969
 clear if he is going to make some video him 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.610
 have to come to my house we do the 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.210
 we edit it and then upload it to 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.460
 Youtube 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.280
 and well and this is how the cube is solved 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.419
 like putting together a 3 by 3 cube is 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.510
 totally identical but if this layer 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.520
 come to spin 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.130
 they would have to learn more movements 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.310
 three for three for four , I hope 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.170
 you liked the video and as always 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.170
 we are until the next hasta luego
