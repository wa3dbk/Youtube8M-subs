00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
of units because they were just so hard

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.440 
of units because they were just so hard
to<00:03:49.799> frickin<00:03:50.190> fine<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.000> guys<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.389> the

playstation 4 is hard to find the

playstation 4 is hard to find the
playstation<00:03:54.660> 2<00:03:54.870> at<00:03:55.170> launch<00:03:55.590> was<00:03:56.400> near

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
playstation 2 at launch was near

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.550 
playstation 2 at launch was near
impossible<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:58.290> find<00:03:59.419> on<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.660> other<00:04:00.780> hand<00:04:01.049> we

impossible to find on the other hand we

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.430 
impossible to find on the other hand we
got<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.579> wii<00:04:02.760> u<00:04:03.030> with<00:04:03.569> competition<00:04:04.260> from<00:04:04.349> the

got the wii u with competition from the
xbox<00:04:04.709> one<00:04:05.190> which<00:04:05.669> is<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.940> easiest<00:04:06.299> system<00:04:06.569> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
xbox one which is the easiest system the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.530 
xbox one which is the easiest system the
fine<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.380> all<00:04:07.650> time<00:04:07.919> and<00:04:08.280> then<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.269> got<00:04:09.419> the

fine of all time and then we got the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.289 
fine of all time and then we got the
playstation<00:04:10.109> 4<00:04:10.349> which<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.950> kind<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.670> hard<00:04:12.000> to

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
playstation 4 which is kind of hard to

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.820 
playstation 4 which is kind of hard to
find<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.140> try<00:04:13.349> you're<00:04:13.980> fine<00:04:14.220> see

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
find but if you try you're fine see

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.770 
find but if you try you're fine see
not<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.010> same<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.489> perhaps<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.570> most

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
not the same and perhaps the most

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.319 
not the same and perhaps the most
important<00:04:18.590> reason<00:04:18.709> why<00:04:18.890> this<00:04:19.070> comparison<00:04:20.000> is

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
important reason why this comparison is

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.860 
important reason why this comparison is
retarded<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:22.490> fact<00:04:22.730> that<00:04:22.850> these<00:04:23.540> dudes

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
retarded is the fact that these dudes

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.540 
retarded is the fact that these dudes
apparently<00:04:24.560> don't<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.770> dreamcast
