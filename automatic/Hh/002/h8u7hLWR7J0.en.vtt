00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.420
 the reception of tv3 high differential yo 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.130
 I think it is already unquestionable 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.689
 simply the cinema that the audience and 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.450
 mainly because it consolidates the diffusion 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.740
 of a television pedal in Catalan to 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.480
 all my list 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.210
 he thinks it's important I'm in tv3 at 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.850
 country valencià no but I voted for the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.920
 reasons for entry anticipate that I think 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.860
 do not put a ban do not be in a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 epoch with censorship follows a weapon 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.229
 used constantly while the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.769
 society is evolving and I think that 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:46.129
 he throws us career and tornadoes in dealers 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.420
 and so many things because I do not know 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.399
 explanations yes 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.460
 I do not say to enter the new house 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.469
 very armed friends and focuses on me I'm 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.159
 It is somehow 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.159
 country valencià 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.860
 german chains moroccan is would be of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.680
 tot arreu sure because you're not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.990
 well of the second time that the country 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.570
 Valencià encourages you 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 comes to the government against the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.240
 tv3 reception the first time he goes to 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.450
 be the government of the brother and the psoe 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 since this second arrival where is the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.920
 govern of the pp that you a few elections 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 imminent and good in some way the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 what happens to valencia 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.869
 PD3 always opens you in the juncture 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.240
 electoral and both the interests of the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.330
 parties and not in the interests of the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.289
 society the interest of society 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.560
 logically it is to have a vehicle of 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.259
 linguistic normalization as it is tv3 and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 that's why thousands of Valencians go 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.590
 commit to talking about arnet 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.149
 tickets and do everything to be able 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.130
 buy the repeaters that now 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.799
 we have repeaters are from the pub you 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.500
 lost some way and in surprise at 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.860
 government politicians that this is a 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 it's a barbarity in the world 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.690
 globalized in that we are now well 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.390
 I will also make it clear that it allows 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.240
 my state a barbarity the opportunity 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.610
 that tv3 has lost having a 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.770
 potential Valencian audience that in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.140
 that moment could manifest itself 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.160
 civically against the decision of the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.570
 pp and if it were not because tv3 either 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.430
 I consider that affect the 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.280
 Valencian interests because in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.380
 the contents reflective mail us the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.520
 valencià reality of the country has seen 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.520
 corners to the country valencià
