just<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.019> drag<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.590> left<00:02:24.769> of

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
just going to drag that to the left of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.710 
just going to drag that to the left of
it<00:02:25.989> ok<00:02:27.640> now<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.700> want<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> object<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.570> be<00:02:29.630> able

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it ok now we want the object to be able

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720 
it ok now we want the object to be able
to<00:02:29.840> turn<00:02:30.049> where<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.470> hold<00:02:30.650> left<00:02:30.920> button<00:02:31.250> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
to turn where we hold left button so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.840 
to turn where we hold left button so
type<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.030> Direction<00:02:32.769> plus<00:02:33.769> equals<00:02:34.220> let's<00:02:34.610> say

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
type in Direction plus equals let's say

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.150 
type in Direction plus equals let's say
five<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:36.350> type<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.709> image<00:02:37.040> angle<00:02:37.370> ah<00:02:42.160> equals

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
five now type in image angle ah equals

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.670 
five now type in image angle ah equals
direction<00:02:43.730> well<00:02:44.329> what<00:02:44.510> did<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.720> do<00:02:45.049> first

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
direction well what did I just do first

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.800 
direction well what did I just do first
of<00:02:45.859> all<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.130> set<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.549> objects<00:02:46.850> direction<00:02:47.420> that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
of all I set the objects direction that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.759 
of all I set the objects direction that
that<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.350> object<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.709> going<00:02:49.310> towards

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that the object is going towards

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.610 
that the object is going towards
increase<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:52.010> by<00:02:52.250> five<00:02:52.700> now<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:54.170> want<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
increase that by five now and I want the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.789 
increase that by five now and I want the
object<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.459> face<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.510> way<00:02:56.690> it's<00:02:56.930> going<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.410> sent

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
object to face the way it's going I sent

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.470 
object to face the way it's going I sent
the<00:02:57.890> objects<00:02:58.190> image<00:02:58.519> ankles<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.060> direction

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the objects image ankles to direction

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.900 
the objects image ankles to direction
but<00:03:00.320> what<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.620> image<00:03:00.829> angle<00:03:01.100> image<00:03:01.459> angle<00:03:01.760> is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
but what is image angle image angle is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.440 
but what is image angle image angle is
the<00:03:02.150> angle<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.989> sprite<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.680> facing<00:03:04.579> so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the angle that the sprite is facing so

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.470 
the angle that the sprite is facing so
when<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.660> said<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.560> direction<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.239> click

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
when I said that to direction so I click

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.280 
when I said that to direction so I click

now<00:03:17.490> at<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.150> keyboard<00:03:18.710> right<00:03:19.710> event<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:22.470> so

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
now at the keyboard right event now so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.400 
now at the keyboard right event now so
i'll<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.670> do<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.720> chained

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
i'll have to do that at now is chained

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.330 
i'll have to do that at now is chained

nandi player into the room it's going to

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.710 
nandi player into the room it's going to
test<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.080> game<00:03:43.670> okay<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.150> now<00:03:45.300> as<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.540> see

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
test the game okay and now as you see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.780 
test the game okay and now as you see
the<00:03:45.810> player<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.170> turn<00:03:46.320> left<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.860> right<00:03:47.100> but

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the player can turn left and right but

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.570 
the player can turn left and right but
he<00:03:48.090> can't<00:03:48.360> go<00:03:48.480> forward<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:48.990> reverse<00:03:49.580> now

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
he can't go forward and reverse now

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.950 
he can't go forward and reverse now
let's<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.000> make<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> player<00:03:51.360> go<00:03:51.570> forward

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
let's going to make a player go forward

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960 
let's going to make a player go forward
and<00:03:52.080> reverse<00:03:52.320> psych<00:03:53.160> player<00:03:53.400> go<00:03:53.550> forward

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
and reverse psych player go forward

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.330 
and reverse psych player go forward
first<00:03:54.540> we<00:03:54.870> need<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.110> set<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.350> friction<00:03:55.740> what

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
first we need to set the friction what

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.100 
first we need to set the friction what
is<00:03:56.460> friction<00:03:56.940> friction<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.750> what<00:03:57.900> makes<00:03:58.020> the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
is friction friction is what makes the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.230 
is friction friction is what makes the
player<00:03:58.320> come<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> slow<00:03:58.920> steady<00:03:59.130> stop<00:03:59.460> so<00:04:00.090> I'd

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
player come to a slow steady stop so I'd

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.910 
player come to a slow steady stop so I'd
friction<00:04:00.780> then<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> player<00:04:01.440> will<00:04:01.620> keep<00:04:01.800> on

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
friction then the player will keep on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.890 
friction then the player will keep on
going<00:04:02.220> at<00:04:02.370> one<00:04:02.520> straight<00:04:02.850> or<00:04:03.090> one<00:04:03.480> direction

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
going at one straight or one direction

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750 
going at one straight or one direction
without<00:04:04.050> stopping<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.310> we're<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.580> add<00:04:05.730> a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
without stopping so we're going to add a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.080 
without stopping so we're going to add a
vent<00:04:06.200> create<00:04:07.200> let's<00:04:08.070> go<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.580> create<00:04:08.790> event

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
vent create let's go to the create event

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.980 
vent create let's go to the create event
type<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.080> friction<00:04:10.560> equals<00:04:13.280> 0.5<00:04:14.390> 0.5<00:04:15.390> is

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
type in friction equals 0.5 0.5 is

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.960 
type in friction equals 0.5 0.5 is
actually<00:04:16.230> what<00:04:16.350> i<00:04:16.380> recommend<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:17.730> click<00:04:17.880> the
