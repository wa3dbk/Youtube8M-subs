00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello here is klaus schinke again 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.849
 astro navigation just after the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 last stormed at the height of one 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.690
 went over the horizon and which 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 We want to make corrections necessary 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.890
 Today we will look at what we are with the height 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 can start at all 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.769
 I have to necessarily mine 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 favorite picture strongly do not show me 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 as a star trek fan it always remembers 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 Immediately to the tactical screen 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.980
 the pink ship as the enterprise 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.000
 attacked the absolute madness 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.020
 then the whole thing is here too 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.640
 three-dimensional and without glasses 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.660
 by the way, this ball is here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.500
 heaven's ball 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 yes heard correctly 500 years after the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 We always have the end of the Middle Ages 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 another ball over us at the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
 hang stars 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.149
 you probably think all that now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.829
 no one really understands this 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.899
 well the astronomers use such 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 Models for all possible movements of the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.109
 to calculate frames for example 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.109
 to predict gloominess 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 Astronomical navigation has something to do with it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.740
 astronomy we have to do well in there 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.600
 bite the sour apple or now I 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 say astro navigation has above all 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.700
 something to do with navigation 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.259
 and that comes from navigare the seafaring 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.390
 and that is well known on ours 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 mother earth instead 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 So we bring only times our feet 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.979
 from the infinite far back again 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 on the ground 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.119
 That means in our case 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.939
 maybe even better the banks of one 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.060
 ship in between so serve honest 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.340
 that here under my feet quite far 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.950
 removes a virtual point on one 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.009
 virtual ball itella is called you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 is not very exciting for me 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.270
 because even if there was something as long as the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 Earth becomes opaque then I will 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 never looked back so back from 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.270
 space on the earth 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.180
 if we assume that in this direction 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.100
 The concern is then you know from 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 Last time that the sun is already so far 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.900
 it is removed that there is no parallax 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.840
 is missing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.820
 that means no matter where you are on the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.150
 earth you see the sun always 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.550
 in the same direction 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.440
 what do you think you might see? 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.010
 The sun does not shine from everywhere 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.570
 earth in the same direction now it 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.350
 Does not really matter where you are 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.500
 but stand as you are German here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.190
 For example, you can see the sun exactly 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.770
 over you 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 It is therefore perpendicular to your zenith 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 above the horizon the point on the earth 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.170
 above which the sun stands in the zenith 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.640
 by the way, the picture point of the sun 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.430
 pelÃ© wants it abbreviated if you but 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.650
 Here you stand then you see the sun 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.050
 no longer perpendicular to it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 in this example 42 degrees above the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.520
 horizon 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.340
 maybe you can just stand here 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.350
 why the male with his feet on the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.060
 the sun is shining and not with the eyes 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.820
 Well, it's strong, of course 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.140
 oversimplified but think 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.180
 would be correct even if it were correct 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.470
 Dimension must be the eye cavities error 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.200
 be corrected keyword camp deep 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.640
 So this 42 degrees further here is called 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.860
 the cover of the sun 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.110
 she can be very accurate with the sextant 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.340
 be measured 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.530
 Actually we are interested 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.950
 another angle namely that of the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.650
 sun to our zenith the so-called 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 zenith distance does not use this winter 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.550
 so easy to measure then in the zenith 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.280
 yes no sharp edge again horizon 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.920
 but it turns out easy 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.470
 the height calculated that the rest to 90 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.500
 degree in our case is the teeth 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.750
 distance thus 90 - 42 thus 48 degrees 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.640
 Now comes the exciting the cenit 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.570
 distance is equal to the angle but in 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.540
 the drawing here 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.880
 if you do not enjoy mathematics, you have to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.320
 either look twice 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.530
 Minister of labor and pa are absolute 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.170
 right now and beware there is that 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.640
 distance from you to bild.de sun 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.100
 if you are the height and serve 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.630
 because distanz know then you know how 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.060
 far from the point of view of the sun 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.100
 you're gone if you say well now 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.170
 good but distance you are but in ten 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.490
 sometimes not even in the grave then I 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.020
 a nice message 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.210
 which has since been 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.210
 sport boat license see not changed 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.490
 a mile is one minute so one 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.660
 60 degrees 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.330
 This is not just true for the rain 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.950
 but for all large circles so circles 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.010
 around the earth the center of the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.010
 Earth's center is in our example 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.620
 So we are 48 degrees times 60 times 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.040
 2880 nautical miles from the picture point of 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.590
 sun away now is also clear 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.320
 why is that so often at altitude 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.320
 accuracy arrive relationship you 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.660
 Accuracy is trumps for every minute 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.030
 every 60 degrees 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.400
 that you are doing the height measurement 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.890
 Do you lie a mile with yours? 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.690
 result next to it 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.580
 For example, if you raise your eyesight 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.530
 his sailing yacht so the child deep 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.200
 not taken into account then you make 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.180
 an error of about one twentieth 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.669
 grad that is already 30 times as far 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.530
 so good that you know how far you are from 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.510
 picture point of the sun are used 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.630
 you of course only something if you too 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.040
 Travel where the picture is and for that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.750
 There are such books here 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.850
 here arises for each time in the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.740
 year where the picture point of the sun and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.530
 also that of the other relevant stars 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.360
 strictly speaking, here stands the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.430
 position of the rock on our 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.870
 but it is heavenly ball 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.190
 identical to the position of the 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.140
 picture it on the earth 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.450
 Here you will also find all the information 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.580
 you need the corrections for 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.289
 the conti drops the refraction and 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.810
 to make the parallax error but 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.970
 more books this year 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.330
 it was that other time for today 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.630
 first bye and until the next 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.630
 times
