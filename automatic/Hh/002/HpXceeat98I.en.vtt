00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
was still new days I guess that the law

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.470 
was still new days I guess that the law
changed<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.630> 2000<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.130> hangover<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

the<00:01:53.340> first<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.790> my<00:01:53.880> life<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.350> said

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the first time in my life that I said

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
the first time in my life that I said
that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> was<00:01:55.799> gay<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> people<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.820> I'd<00:01:57.119> been

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that I was gay to people so I'd been

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
that I was gay to people so I'd been
servant<00:01:57.659> by<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.020> 18<00:01:58.290> mom<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.979> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
servant by then 18 mom so that's when I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.499 
servant by then 18 mom so that's when I
came<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.399> did<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.030> make<00:02:00.270> any<00:02:00.479> difference

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
came out did it make any difference

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
came out did it make any difference
being<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> closet<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:02.130> coming<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.579> in

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
being in the closet or coming out in

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.280 
being in the closet or coming out in
terms<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.329> relationships<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.259> your

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
terms of your relationships with your

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
terms of your relationships with your
comrades<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.520> guess<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> did<00:02:06.420> come<00:02:06.509> out

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
comrades I guess when I did come out

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869 
comrades I guess when I did come out
things<00:02:06.840> changed<00:02:07.200> only<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:08.759> were

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
things changed only because people were

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.059 
things changed only because people were
very<00:02:09.149> curious<00:02:09.420> about<00:02:09.750> who<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.379> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
very curious about who I was and this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
very curious about who I was and this
this<00:02:11.340> background<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.180> mine<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this background of mine so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
this background of mine so
there<00:02:13.739> was<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.130> sort<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:15.230> questions

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
there was a lot of sort of questions

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
there was a lot of sort of questions
from<00:02:16.380> other<00:02:16.530> soldiers<00:02:16.950> are<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> gay<00:02:17.819> one

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
from other soldiers are you the gay one

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.970 
from other soldiers are you the gay one
or<00:02:18.150> whatever<00:02:18.420> things<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.770> in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
or whatever things like that but in

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
or whatever things like that but in
terms<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> my<00:02:20.430> professional<00:02:20.910> relationships<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
terms of my professional relationships I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.250 
terms of my professional relationships I
think<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.980> was<00:02:23.099> not<00:02:23.250> much<00:02:23.400> change<00:02:23.700> actually

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
think there was not much change actually

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
think there was not much change actually

a<00:03:00.150> situation<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.049> was<00:03:01.200> heading

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
a situation I think I was heading

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.380 
a situation I think I was heading
towards<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.130> bit<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> homophobic<00:03:02.940> beaten<00:03:03.299> at

towards a bit of a homophobic beaten at

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.710 
towards a bit of a homophobic beaten at
one<00:03:03.510> point<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.140> he<00:03:04.940> diffused<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> situation

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
one point and he diffused that situation

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.820 
one point and he diffused that situation
completely<00:03:07.019> unreal

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
completely unreal

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.410 
completely unreal
really<00:03:08.190> sorted<00:03:08.489> things<00:03:08.610> out<00:03:08.819> how<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.269> you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
really sorted things out how do you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.990 
really sorted things out how do you
think<00:03:09.630> he<00:03:10.349> would<00:03:10.500> react<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.580> writing

about<00:03:12.239> him<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> book<00:03:12.900> because<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.650> suppose

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
about him in the book because I suppose

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
about him in the book because I suppose
some<00:03:14.459> soldiers<00:03:14.880> might<00:03:15.060> not<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.569> fact

some soldiers might not like the fact
that<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.989> give<00:03:16.170> details<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:16.920> went<00:03:17.099> on<00:03:17.250> on

openly<00:03:45.930> out<00:03:46.139> mmm<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
openly out mmm is that it's a really

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.020 
openly out mmm is that it's a really
good<00:03:49.109> question<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.680> have<00:03:49.829> some<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.280> explore

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
good question and I have some I explore

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.460 
good question and I have some I explore
that<00:03:51.209> at<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.420> end<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.690> my<00:03:51.780> book<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.139> I<00:03:52.410> do

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
that at the end of my book and I do

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.840 
that at the end of my book and I do
think<00:03:52.889> we're<00:03:53.040> selling<00:03:53.310> ourselves<00:03:53.430> down

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
think we're selling ourselves down

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.509 
think we're selling ourselves down
slightly<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.480> look<00:03:54.600> at<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> diversity

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
slightly when you look at the diversity

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.650 
slightly when you look at the diversity
amongst<00:03:56.519> our<00:03:56.760> generals<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.359> doesn't

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
amongst our generals it doesn't

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.690 
amongst our generals it doesn't
represent<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.560> diversity<00:03:58.920> further<00:03:59.340> down<00:03:59.549> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
represent the diversity further down the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.559 
represent the diversity further down the
ranks<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.359> know<00:04:01.400> 2013<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:02.910> should<00:04:03.450> be

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
ranks and you know 2013 we should be

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.539

having<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:04.019> general<00:04:04.560> who's<00:04:04.829> not<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.370> white

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
having a general who's not just a white
