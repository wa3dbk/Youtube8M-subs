00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
one's more of a gentle kind of spoon
shape<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.640> much<00:00:47.879> smaller<00:00:48.360> wand<00:00:48.750> than

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
shape and it's a much smaller wand than

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.880 
shape and it's a much smaller wand than
the<00:00:49.590> normal<00:00:49.980> covergirl<00:00:51.170> mascaras<00:00:52.170> normally<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the normal covergirl mascaras normally I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.020 
the normal covergirl mascaras normally I
will<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.899> inserting<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> somewhere<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:56.399> video

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
will be inserting in somewhere a video

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
will be inserting in somewhere a video
clip<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.870> did<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.320> me<00:00:58.469> actually<00:00:58.620> applying

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
clip that I did of me actually applying

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.970 
clip that I did of me actually applying
the<00:00:59.129> mascara<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.620> from<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> can

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the mascara and from what you can

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850 
the mascara and from what you can
probably<00:01:02.129> tell<00:01:02.309> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> clip<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.860> um

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
probably tell from the clip I have um

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.080 
probably tell from the clip I have um
pretty<00:01:05.610> noticeable<00:01:06.330> eyelashes<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> my<00:01:07.560> own

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
pretty noticeable eyelashes on my own

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
pretty noticeable eyelashes on my own
they're<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.299> fun<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:09.930> pretty

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
they're pretty fun and they're pretty

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.060 
they're pretty fun and they're pretty
short<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.200> mascara<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
short so I really like a good mascara to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.420 
short so I really like a good mascara to
bulk<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.430> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
bulk them up a little bit and this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
bulk them up a little bit and this
mascara<00:01:17.880> definitely<00:01:18.450> does<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
mascara definitely does that it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.039 
mascara definitely does that it
definitely<00:01:19.950> makes<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.310> noticeable

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
definitely makes them more noticeable

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.590 
definitely makes them more noticeable
it's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.530> nice<00:01:22.890> black<00:01:23.369> formula<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's a very nice black formula and it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.490 
it's a very nice black formula and it
really<00:01:24.780> makes<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.290> eyelashes<00:01:25.710> stand<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.330> and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
really makes my eyelashes stand out and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
really makes my eyelashes stand out and
like<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> name<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> packaging

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
like the name and some of the packaging

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
like the name and some of the packaging
and<00:01:30.810> suggesting<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.100> at

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and suggesting it's a very good at

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
and suggesting it's a very good at
building<00:01:32.369> volume<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.560> definitely

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
building volume so it's definitely

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.090 
building volume so it's definitely
bulking<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.520> eyelashes<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.740> typically<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bulking up my eyelashes and typically I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.600 
bulking up my eyelashes and typically I
will<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.119> coats<00:01:39.390> first<00:01:39.960> coat<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.610> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
will do two coats first coat is a you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039

in your face eyelashes the one coat

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.749

it's<00:01:50.880> easy<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.329> build<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it's easy to build up a little bit of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's easy to build up a little bit of
volume<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.280> run<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> door<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.970> an

a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.810> length<00:02:01.049> there's<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a little bit more length there's a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
a little bit more length there's a
second<00:02:01.710> coat<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> would<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.030> say<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
second coat but I would not say this is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.679 
second coat but I would not say this is
a<00:02:03.659> lengthening<00:02:04.200> mascara<00:02:04.880> but<00:02:05.880> volume<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
a lengthening mascara but volume it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
a lengthening mascara but volume it
definitely<00:02:07.110> gave<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.259> volume<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.220> think

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
definitely gave me volume and I think

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.940 
definitely gave me volume and I think
you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.849> pretty<00:02:09.060> well<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.259> before

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you can see pretty well from the before

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.330 
you can see pretty well from the before
and<00:02:11.099> after

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and after

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.520 
and after
images<00:02:12.879> that<00:02:13.299> it<00:02:13.810> definitely<00:02:14.109> makes<00:02:14.409> a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
images that it definitely makes a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.589 
images that it definitely makes a
difference<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.359> will<00:02:16.359> say<00:02:16.569> though<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.280> my

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
difference I will say though that my

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.080 
difference I will say though that my
Alma<00:02:19.599> mascaras<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:21.310> triple<00:02:21.640> effect<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.030> they

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
Alma mascaras the triple effect and they

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.199 
Alma mascaras the triple effect and they
get<00:02:22.209> up<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.420> grow<00:02:22.569> both<00:02:23.109> have<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:24.489> similar

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
get up and grow both have a similar

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.750 
get up and grow both have a similar
effect<00:02:25.359> I<00:02:25.719> have<00:02:25.930> such<00:02:26.170> fine<00:02:26.799> short<00:02:27.189> eyelashes

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
effect I have such fine short eyelashes

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.240 
effect I have such fine short eyelashes
that<00:02:27.849> it's<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.269> not<00:02:29.139> that<00:02:29.319> difficult<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:30.040> get

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
that it's it's not that difficult to get

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.429 
that it's it's not that difficult to get
a<00:02:30.280> pretty<00:02:30.579> significant<00:02:31.269> before<00:02:32.079> and<00:02:32.200> after

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
a pretty significant before and after

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.080 
a pretty significant before and after
picture<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.859> because<00:02:33.010> there's<00:02:33.189> a<00:02:33.280> lot<00:02:33.459> there

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
picture just because there's a lot there

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.179 
picture just because there's a lot there
in<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.480> beginning<00:02:34.599> overall<00:02:35.439> but<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> would<00:02:36.010> say

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
in the beginning overall but I would say

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.869 
in the beginning overall but I would say
is<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.189> impossible<00:02:39.819> to

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
is I don't think it's impossible to

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.569 
is I don't think it's impossible to
clump<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.269> mascara<00:02:40.719> I<00:02:41.200> felt<00:02:41.950> like<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.280> didn't

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
clump this mascara I felt like I didn't

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.330 
clump this mascara I felt like I didn't
do<00:02:42.790> my<00:02:43.239> left<00:02:43.480> eye<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:43.750> camera<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:45.129> if<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
do my left eye on camera and on if you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.800 
do my left eye on camera and on if you
can<00:02:45.430> see<00:02:45.609> but<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.239> little<00:02:46.599> bit<00:02:46.689> more

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
can see but it is a little bit more

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.839 
can see but it is a little bit more
clumpy<00:02:47.230> than<00:02:47.409> I<00:02:47.439> would<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.709> maybe<00:02:48.700> it's

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
clumpy than I would like maybe it's

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.679 
clumpy than I would like maybe it's
something<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.209> right<00:02:49.359> word<00:02:49.480> but<00:02:49.629> just

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
something that the right word but just

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.550 
something that the right word but just
more<00:02:51.540> thick<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.840> some<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.200> points<00:02:53.500> I've

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
more thick like some of the points I've

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.409 
more thick like some of the points I've
been<00:02:53.650> kind<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.889> pulled<00:02:54.099> together<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:55.299> a

sometimes you have mascaras that are

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.449 
sometimes you have mascaras that are
very<00:03:18.940> crunchy<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.419> your<00:03:19.510> eyelashes<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.280> this

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
overall I think it definitely is a good

volumizing<00:03:26.290> mascara<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.949> really<00:03:27.609> appreciate

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
volumizing mascara I really appreciate

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.750 
volumizing mascara I really appreciate
with<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.479> one<00:03:28.689> that<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.500> wand<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.979> smaller<00:03:30.340> I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
with this one that the wand is smaller I

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240 
with this one that the wand is smaller I
have<00:03:31.090> some<00:03:31.239> kind<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.419> smaller<00:03:31.689> eyes<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.680> with

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
have some kind of smaller eyes and with

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.830 
have some kind of smaller eyes and with
the<00:03:33.340> covergirl<00:03:33.609> mascaras<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.180> always<00:03:34.569> felt

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
the covergirl mascaras I always felt

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.699 
the covergirl mascaras I always felt
like<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.319> would<00:03:36.129> get<00:03:36.840> mascara<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:38.139> my<00:03:38.290> eyelid

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
like I would get mascara on my eyelid

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.580 
like I would get mascara on my eyelid
and<00:03:39.329> around<00:03:40.329> my<00:03:40.479> eye<00:03:40.509> because<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.259> WHA<00:03:41.409> was

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and around my eye because the WHA was

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
and around my eye because the WHA was
just<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:41.949> big<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.579> just<00:03:42.790> couldn't<00:03:43.060> really

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
just so big I just couldn't really

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.539 
just so big I just couldn't really
maneuver<00:03:43.689> around<00:03:43.750> my<00:03:43.989> eye<00:03:44.019> without<00:03:44.889> making<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
maneuver around my eye without making a

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.409 
maneuver around my eye without making a
huge<00:03:45.790> mess<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.689> this<00:03:47.049> one<00:03:47.229> I<00:03:47.530> think<00:03:47.739> just<00:03:48.009> by

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
huge mess and this one I think just by

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.689 
huge mess and this one I think just by
virtue<00:03:49.419> of<00:03:49.659> having<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:50.079> smaller<00:03:50.319> wand<00:03:50.650> makes<00:03:51.579> a

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
virtue of having a smaller wand makes a

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.899 
virtue of having a smaller wand makes a
lot<00:03:51.879> easier<00:03:52.269> I'm<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.780> curved<00:03:53.019> shape<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.909> guess

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
lot easier I'm the curved shape I guess

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.099 
lot easier I'm the curved shape I guess
it's<00:03:55.120> kind<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.359> nice<00:03:55.479> I<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:55.900> feel<00:03:56.799> like<00:03:56.979> it

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
it's kind of nice I don't feel like it

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.599 
it's kind of nice I don't feel like it
makes<00:03:59.109> her<00:03:59.319> break<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.009> really<00:04:00.310> don't<00:04:00.489> think

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
makes her break it I really don't think

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.990 
makes her break it I really don't think
I<00:04:01.000> mean<00:04:01.780> sometimes<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.229> use<00:04:02.439> it<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:03.340> know<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.819> C

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
I mean sometimes I use it you know the C

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.490 
I mean sometimes I use it you know the C
shape<00:04:04.209> toward<00:04:04.509> my<00:04:04.629> eyes<00:04:04.810> sometimes<00:04:05.259> you<00:04:05.379> get

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
shape toward my eyes sometimes you get

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.920 
shape toward my eyes sometimes you get
the<00:04:05.620> curve<00:04:05.829> away<00:04:06.129> so<00:04:06.189> I<00:04:06.400> didn't<00:04:06.909> I<00:04:07.150> don't<00:04:07.810> know

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
the curve away so I didn't I don't know

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.939 
the curve away so I didn't I don't know
if<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.109> really<00:04:08.319> feel<00:04:08.470> like<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.650> makes<00:04:08.829> a

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
if I really feel like that makes a

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.780 
if I really feel like that makes a
difference<00:04:09.250> um<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:11.919> think<00:04:12.310> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
difference um but if you I think you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.309 
difference um but if you I think you
would<00:04:12.939> like<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.329> more<00:04:13.569> if<00:04:13.689> you<00:04:13.810> have<00:04:14.019> longer

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
would like this more if you have longer

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.379 
would like this more if you have longer
lashes<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.919> are<00:04:15.159> going<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.459> be<00:04:15.519> thin<00:04:15.849> cuz

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
lashes that are going to be thin cuz

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.709 
lashes that are going to be thin cuz
since<00:04:16.900> mine<00:04:17.139> are<00:04:17.409> thin<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.099> short<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.669> prefer<00:04:19.389> a

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:19.719 
since mine are thin and short I prefer a

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.529 
since mine are thin and short I prefer a
little<00:04:20.079> bit<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.529> thicker<00:04:21.300> formula<00:04:22.300> this

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
little bit of a thicker formula this

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.600 
little bit of a thicker formula this
would<00:04:23.110> not<00:04:23.260> be<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.500> watery<00:04:23.889> formula<00:04:24.279> I<00:04:24.340> would

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
would not be a watery formula I would

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.249 
would not be a watery formula I would
saying<00:04:24.789> but<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.419> not<00:04:25.539> as<00:04:25.659> thick<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.110> owl

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
saying but it's not as thick as the owl

my<00:04:26.439> mascaras<00:04:27.039> and<00:04:27.069> those<00:04:27.400> are<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.580> ones<00:04:27.669> that

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
my mascaras and those are the ones that

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.100 
my mascaras and those are the ones that
can<00:04:28.000> really<00:04:28.030> build<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.419> lot<00:04:28.569> of<00:04:28.719> volume<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
can really build a lot of volume and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.749 
can really build a lot of volume and
length<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:30.250> it's<00:04:30.400> pretty<00:04:30.520> much<00:04:30.699> just

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
length and as it's pretty much just

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.379 
length and as it's pretty much just
volume<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.580> Alma<00:04:33.879> ones<00:04:34.060> are<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> little

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
volume so if the Alma ones are a little

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.429 
volume so if the Alma ones are a little
bit<00:04:34.479> too<00:04:34.569> thick<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.169> might<00:04:35.319> really

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
bit too thick for you you might really

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.170 
bit too thick for you you might really
like<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.639> just<00:04:36.849> want<00:04:36.969> like<00:04:37.060> a
