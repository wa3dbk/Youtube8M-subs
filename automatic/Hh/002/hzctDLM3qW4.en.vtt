00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 three together here is babble me 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.890
 Welcome you from Hanover from Maschsee 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.450
 pond here is pretty cold but it is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 still nice and today I have one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.639
 nice topic for you adapter for canon 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.639
 objective and sony alpha cameras 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.820
 many of you asked me babbel 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.170
 we do not have any objective now 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.030
 We are very happy with these objectives 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.220
 satisfied but we want anyway 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.790
 Try that with his camera 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.200
 go and I have that for you now 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.270
 made so I have such an adapter 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.580
 borrowed this is an adapter of 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.750
 company more taboo and I want to now 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.920
 the objective 24 to 70 28 of connoisseurs 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.170
 at the Sony Alpha 7 Market 2 test before 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.559
 do not say anything before so that's it 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.390
 of course, a conversion and be clear 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.450
 adapter is not completely without but allowed 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.820
 because it costs around 400 450 euro in 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.729
 some shop even 500 euro is not 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.890
 irrelevant and adapter supported 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.920
 autofocus that of course very cool though 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.979
 I would like to test now if such a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 autofocus is really okay i have 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.900
 Now turn on the camera and take 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 equal to the focal length 70 mm and 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.030
 take photos with autofocus like this 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 and it looks like it takes a lot 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.090
 long until it has focused so me 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.800
 now have about one and a half to two 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.080
 seconds needed to focus that 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 is of course not optimal because 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.980
 Especially for shooting of moving 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 objects such as bunnies 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.140
 monkey puppy dog ​​and so on athlete 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 burning cars motorcycles and so on 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.190
 is not that satisfactory 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.500
 that means we can do such a car 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.630
 do not use focusing in principle 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.520
 that it is not so nice i have now 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.740
 tried again the bag too 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.289
 take photos that did not want to run away 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.700
 and that lasts now is of course one 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.010
 absolute scandal in the people with the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.530
 autofocus works say okay we want 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.540
 not yes but I want you the following 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.330
 tell it looks like this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.150
 so a car focus clear by the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.739
 adapter on lens that takes everything 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 but have you ever tried one again 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.090
 to focus no then I can you 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 betrayed a tip and that the following 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 here is the first option live 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.230
 view and live view we can 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.550
 detail in the picture enlarge and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.590
 focus manually 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.909
 That's all very nice, but it takes 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.650
 for a long time, for example 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.550
 flowers photograph that that no 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.130
 theme there we can 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.690
 Focus very fast and that 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.060
 works well with the magnification 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.730
 but there is still a cool one here 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.040
 function which is also available in alpha 6000 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.880
 I already have users alpha 7 11 7 11 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.620
 7 market 2 focus picking focus beijing 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.650
 does not hear that yet 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.240
 it virtually highlight of edge at 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.910
 the focus and become for example 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.710
 this is how we photograph a person today 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.050
 in front of the forest we can for example 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.700
 focus on the person or on the person 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.730
 forest and that works very well 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.200
 works only with manual 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.090
 Focus when the camera is on manually 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 have adjusted then everything fits 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.950
 wonderful and I want bolger now 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.590
 Take a picture of how she feels freezing 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.490
 me just fine and I have now 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.500
 quite fast 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.270
 olga is focused and if i am not all 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.980
 focus does not want to take pictures 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.080
 want then I shoot for 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.360
 example trees and it works too 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.120
 back then so the trees will be heart and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.590
 just search with red color 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.520
 and of course the same is true 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.780
 Also for taking pictures with the display 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.760
 i can now grass, for example 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.440
 take pictures or take pictures 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.290
 or end so here are a few 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.790
 ducks are probably whole 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.500
 but frozen in something completely different 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.040
 as people do not notice that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.040
 fast 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.200
 and if I should focus one way or the other 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.870
 this red mark in sheep 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.239
 Score is really cool what else horny 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040
 we can do the blind here 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.900
 so I can adjust the aperture 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.970
 now for example here with the wheel 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.590
 just as with objective ones 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 built for sony 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.370
 it works just fine and so does it 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.530
 can I say okay now I have now 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.760
 For example, blind 8 and I want 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.010
 have the most beautiful 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.650
 that works wonderfully because I actually 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.440
 only focus on the objects 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.050
 that interest me and especially with 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.300
 I can use the film to synonymous to 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.600
 Example depth of field point too 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.580
 so shift cool history so yes 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.070
 that does not look bad the right way 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.280
 I also showed photos to you so 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.050
 the proven optics of canon ef also 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.760
 I would be especially objective now 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.560
 Of course not sell so me 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.940
 I work with adapters and where do I get these 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.669
 For example, you can use objective 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.139
 just a very nice macro hundreds 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.360
 28 light intensity 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.819
 with such an adapter that works 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.469
 very good and will definitely come soon 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.300
 commitment 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:06.520
 So much for that is the theme for this 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.689
 friday i hope i could get one or 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.539
 help others now 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.300
 in terms of lenses of canon or nikon 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.249
 By the way, there are nikon for the sony 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.599
 of course synonymous adapters have 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.860
 I have not discovered any yet 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.770
 autofocus work 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.389
 but since we have determined now 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.279
 that autofocus and this case pretty 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.430
 Slow then I would say 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:29.800
 Just do it with focus and then Beijing 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.740
 the matter is decided in principle 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.779
 so much I wish you all the best 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.430
 photographed diligently with different 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.810
 lenses with different cameras 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.550
 makes great pictures 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.509
 I'll see you next Friday I 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.509
 looking forward to you
