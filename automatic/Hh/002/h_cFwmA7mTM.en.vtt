00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
then get another gather of molten glass

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
then get another gather of molten glass
on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> end<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> cooler<00:00:51.059> glass<00:00:51.360> while

which is very important for shaping the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
which is very important for shaping the
glass<00:00:56.850> properly<00:00:57.600> later<00:00:57.960> on<00:01:00.320> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> next

earlier the glass blower then gives a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.179 
earlier the glass blower then gives a
puff<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> air<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> blowpipe<00:01:15.900> rod<00:01:16.409> which

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
puff of air into the blowpipe rod which

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
puff of air into the blowpipe rod which
will<00:01:17.430> help<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> plate<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> molten<00:01:18.509> mixture

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
will help and plate the molten mixture

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:30.540 
will help and plate the molten mixture
and<00:01:19.140> further<00:01:19.710> give<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> life

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
just for heating purposes he then places

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.280 
just for heating purposes he then places
