00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.820
 Let's go. It's the distance between two points in space coordinates. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.620
 It is simple to be here 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:16.790
 In such a space room 10 a 1 fa 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.920
 It is z coordinates x and y coordinates as there was coordinates Tteyuu 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:27.840
 It's in space Sir If there are 2 points of a and b like this on such space , that 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 The distance between ab and the length between ab is thus route x 9 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.000
 Damn 25+ y coordinate of the Sai - the wind called the square of the square + z mountain 4- z coordinates of tricks 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 It's just because you are asked 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.070
 And maybe I think it's okay but I'm writing this too officially but not at all 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.190
 It's not official or anything, I think it's already a memoir 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.430
 It is with the time of the plane The time of the plane is 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 I thought about the distance by the theorem of three squares 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.280
 For example, if there is a 9 ab feeling, the distance between this ab is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.579
 here 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.780
 And here we make a right triangle like this 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:11.270
 Its Once you and I Do not Bailly long saga a 2- here 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.750
 The length here is b charge Charlie 1-meeting is sorry I d 1-a 1 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.850
 When 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:22.430
 In length here is b 2-eh 2 and bets 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.870
 So stay up even if you say that the square of this is a ride of two of this by the three- square theorem 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.330
 I think I was 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:33.330
 It's the same in space 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.860
 Ne of the coordinates of the space in the previous space coordinates so that it is easy to write super studio diversification character 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 It I was doing Fu things say 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.500
 So the empty curtain is similar to thinking about a rectangular parallelepiped 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.230
 After all distance of Ellie mother 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.050
 I'm asking for the length here 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.480
 In space 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:57.770
 If you ask for the length here 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.770
 Ne this should have been the English daily at 3 in medium 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 It's look at the 9 right-angled triangle 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.130
 So first, when it is necessary to obtain the length of here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 The length here is 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.720
 I'm Are you still a right-angled triangle cat of the first here here x the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.470
 So 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:29.720
 Here is b b 1- meeting and here is b 2- a 2 and here is 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.490
 You're right out of it at more than 2 jyo b 1-peace squared + beats- rate 2 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.170
 Here and more 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:40.410
 I'm made in the wind that b 3- a 3 Ya because after all ok in this equation 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.560
 ok this is all 3 knowledge 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.060
 So it is easy to say the distance in space a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.560
 Well, the latter is that they and those who have low back want to remember this formula already 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.750
 The root will go x the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 In Kusano, Izaku will improve what mountain z-tax and squared coordinates and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.770
 In a word like 1 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:09.810
 When you ask for the origin and a certain distance, I think that the limitation is all 000 . 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:14.220
 So ap is 22-31 and cherry blossom is 000 000 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:18.120
 xf 上 上 上 バ イ ザ ー 座標 y 上 上 fake to the fake 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:24.450
 If it is calculated to z coordinate, it will stop 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 It's the same as the second one , so minus- Then let 's go to coordinates for a moment like -34-2 route 6 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.099
 It's the same way , even when it's confusing 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.909
 xa 9 2 square large number Weiser of of the the in numerous what beauty of the 4 z sheath 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.970
 Square and theft 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.420
 And by what consisting become Ruto 49 Previous 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.420
 is not it 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.500
 It is together even when you have to know the coordinates of two points like in the past after all 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.570
 In addition to the 2x zoom at the time of 1 click, etc., on monkey 20 z the secret coordinates 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 In mast will be such Fu 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:00.720
 is incredible simple because the distance between the two points here to say whether is ok 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.310
 Anyway this is this formula This formula is not a memorandum I like this house with a reason like this 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.310
 Let's understand the meaning well
