go to visibility quick so what we have

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
go to visibility quick so what we have
is<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.880> text<00:01:39.180> visibility<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> turn

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is the text visibility and we can turn

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.050 
is the text visibility and we can turn
that<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.670> our

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that off if we just want to have our

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
that off if we just want to have our
bevels<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> turn<00:01:43.560> off<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
bevels and we can turn off the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.850 
bevels and we can turn off the
individual<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.759> front<00:01:44.939> bevels<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
individual back or front bevels so just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.289 
individual back or front bevels so just
keep<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.159> mind<00:01:47.250> sometimes<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.090> having

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
keep that in mind sometimes just having

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
keep that in mind sometimes just having
one<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> bevels<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> actually<00:01:50.220> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
one of the bevels is actually kind of a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
one of the bevels is actually kind of a
cool<00:01:50.670> thing<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.009> all

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
cool thing so that is there and then all

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
cool thing so that is there and then all
of<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.549> Phong<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.479> subdivision

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
of your Phong and your subdivision

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.289 
of your Phong and your subdivision
settings<00:01:55.500> are<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.310> visibility<00:01:56.909> options

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
settings are in the visibility options

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.330 
settings are in the visibility options
tab<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> utility<00:01:58.560> tabs

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tab so that's kind of the utility tabs

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.700 
tab so that's kind of the utility tabs
right<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.090> cool<00:02:00.450> stuff<00:02:00.780> happens<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> bevel

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
right the cool stuff happens in bevel

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.399 
right the cool stuff happens in bevel
options<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.119> best<00:02:03.299> part<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
options and the best part is in this

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
options and the best part is in this
spline<00:02:04.710> preset<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.790> roll<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.329> we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
spline preset so if we roll this down we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
spline preset so if we roll this down we
have<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.469> different<00:02:07.860> options<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
have all these different options so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.580 
have all these different options so
let's<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.209> ahead<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.629> say<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> these

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
let's go ahead and put say one of these

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
let's go ahead and put say one of these
profile<00:02:11.039> ones<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.599> see

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
profile ones on here so then you can see

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.340 
profile ones on here so then you can see
that<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.860 
that it
it's<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.010> edge<00:02:14.190> effects<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:15.120> our<00:02:15.390> spline

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it's the edge effects with our spline

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630 
it's the edge effects with our spline
let's<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:16.500> ahead<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.710> try<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.890> other<00:02:17.100> ones<00:02:17.280> try

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
let's go ahead and try it other ones try

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.150 
let's go ahead and try it other ones try
some<00:02:17.940> crazy<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.690> flower<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:20.070> go

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
some crazy like the flower if we go

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.440 
some crazy like the flower if we go
ahead<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.400> look<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
ahead and look in here you can see that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.700 
ahead and look in here you can see that
we're<00:02:21.570> already<00:02:21.720> getting<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.200> pretty<00:02:22.410> crazy

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
we're already getting some pretty crazy

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.670 
we're already getting some pretty crazy
detail<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.900> right<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.170> besides

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
detail in this all right so besides

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.430 
detail in this all right so besides
picking<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.910> these<00:02:27.630> different<00:02:27.690> options

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
picking out all these different options

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.110 
picking out all these different options
which<00:02:28.740> could<00:02:29.010> take<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.610> quite<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.820> while<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
which could take you quite a while to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.570 
which could take you quite a while to
get<00:02:30.210> through<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.960> have<00:02:31.140> our<00:02:31.320> bevel<00:02:31.500> scale<00:02:32.070> so

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
get through we have our bevel scale so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.830 
get through we have our bevel scale so
you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.880> ahead<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.150> scale<00:02:33.540> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you can go ahead and just scale this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.430 
you can go ahead and just scale this
whole<00:02:34.050> guy<00:02:34.350> up<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:35.160> that's<00:02:35.400> what<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.940> and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
whole guy up if that's what you want and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.900 
whole guy up if that's what you want and
the<00:02:37.440> cool<00:02:37.620> thing<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.830> Z<00:02:38.070> scale<00:02:38.280> which<00:02:38.490> actually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the cool thing is Z scale which actually

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.990 
the cool thing is Z scale which actually
is<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.120> extrude<00:02:39.750> depth<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.740> can<00:02:41.000> extrude

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
is the extrude depth so you can extrude

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150 
is the extrude depth so you can extrude
it<00:02:42.090> quite<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> bit<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.660> what<00:02:43.500> would<00:02:43.650> happen<00:02:44.010> if

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
it quite a bit and what would happen if

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
it quite a bit and what would happen if
we<00:02:44.340> went<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.640> where<00:02:44.820> visibility<00:02:45.090> turned<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we went into where visibility turned the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720 
we went into where visibility turned the
back<00:02:45.960> bevel<00:02:46.350> off<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.800> then<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.490> can<00:02:47.610> also

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
back bevel off and then we can also

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.790 
back bevel off and then we can also
slide<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.600> position<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.320> guy<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.680> then

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
slide the position of this guy so then

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.130 
slide the position of this guy so then
we<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:49.980> just<00:02:50.040> maybe<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.240> bevel<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:51.960> can

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
we can just maybe have one bevel we can

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.670 
we can just maybe have one bevel we can
make<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.680> thick<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.720> maybe<00:02:54.720> place<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
make it really thick and maybe place it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.710 
make it really thick and maybe place it
sort<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.520> middle<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.090> guy<00:02:57.300> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
sort of in the middle of this guy and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.240 
sort of in the middle of this guy and
then<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.320> really<00:02:58.560> cool<00:02:58.710> effect

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
then we have this really cool effect

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.340 
then we have this really cool effect
where<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.940> all<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.210> extra<00:03:00.570> detail<00:03:00.930> on

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
where we have all this extra detail on

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.350 
where we have all this extra detail on
our<00:03:01.530> text<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.460> looks<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:02.850> really<00:03:03.150> nice

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
our text and it looks really really nice

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.960 
our text and it looks really really nice
and<00:03:03.710> then<00:03:04.710> another<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.220> cool<00:03:05.490> thing<00:03:05.790> is

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and then another really cool thing is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.880 
and then another really cool thing is
the<00:03:06.180> growth<00:03:06.480> which<00:03:07.140> means<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.770> actually

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the growth which means you can actually

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.330 
the growth which means you can actually
animate<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.630> bevel<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.650> let's<00:03:11.040> go<00:03:11.130> ahead<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
animate the bevel so let's go ahead and

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
animate the bevel so let's go ahead and
check<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.820> out<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.630> can<00:03:12.750> see<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.080> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
check this out as you can see that it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.950 
check this out as you can see that it's
sort<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.590> drawing<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.450> another<00:03:15.750> thing<00:03:15.840> that

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
sort of drawing on so another thing that

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.390 
sort of drawing on so another thing that
we<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.410> go<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.620> our<00:03:16.800> visibility

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
we can do is go to our visibility

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.850 
we can do is go to our visibility
options<00:03:17.850> turn<00:03:18.270> off<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.720> back<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.320> turn<00:03:19.740> off

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
options turn off the back and turn off

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.680 
options turn off the back and turn off
the<00:03:20.040> text<00:03:20.280> visibility<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.330> go<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> our

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the text visibility then go to our

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
the text visibility then go to our
options<00:03:21.960> for<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> growth<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.520> we<00:03:23.970> could

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
options for the growth and we could

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.930 
options for the growth and we could
actually<00:03:24.270> have<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.930> guy<00:03:25.140> growing<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.940> kind

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
actually have this guy growing on kind
