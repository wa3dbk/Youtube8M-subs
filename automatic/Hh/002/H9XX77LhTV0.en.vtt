other<00:02:53.430> fish<00:02:53.670> I've<00:02:53.849> put<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.180> tank<00:02:54.420> once<00:02:55.260> I

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
other fish I've put in the tank once I

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.830 
other fish I've put in the tank once I
put<00:02:55.620> them<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.639> know<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> few<00:02:57.329> days<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
put them in you know for a few days but

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.050 
put them in you know for a few days but
then<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.139> seems<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.530> kind<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.829> go<00:02:59.010> away<00:02:59.310> no

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
then it seems to kind of go away no

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
then it seems to kind of go away no
other<00:03:00.239> fish<00:03:00.569> are<00:03:00.750> showing<00:03:01.109> signs<00:03:01.409> or<00:03:01.769> spots<00:03:02.099> or

his a thin that was roughed up his since
grown<00:03:53.519> back<00:03:53.810> which<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.959> all<00:03:55.109> good<00:03:55.349> i<00:03:55.590> feel

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
grown back which is all good i feel

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.449 
grown back which is all good i feel
quite<00:03:56.040> quickly<00:03:57.229> the<00:03:58.229> other<00:03:58.439> two<00:03:58.739> fish<00:03:59.009> i<00:03:59.189> got

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
quite quickly the other two fish i got

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.640 
quite quickly the other two fish i got
which<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.269> in<00:04:00.389> hiding<00:04:00.689> I<00:04:01.109> don't<00:04:01.409> know<00:04:01.470> where

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
which are in hiding I don't know where

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.210 
which are in hiding I don't know where
they<00:04:01.799> are<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:02.189> a<00:04:02.250> foxface<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:04.530> mimic<00:04:04.949> tang

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
they are is a foxface and a mimic tang

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.879 
they are is a foxface and a mimic tang
or<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:06.030> guess<00:04:06.180> he'll<00:04:06.540> morph<00:04:06.870> into<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.290> chocolate

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
or I guess he'll morph into a chocolate

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.009 
or I guess he'll morph into a chocolate
hang<00:04:08.129> later<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.639> right<00:04:08.879> now<00:04:08.939> it's<00:04:09.299> mimicking<00:04:09.810> a

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
hang later on right now it's mimicking a

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.939 
hang later on right now it's mimicking a
pearl<00:04:10.829> scale<00:04:11.659> angelfish<00:04:12.659> when<00:04:13.139> he<00:04:13.349> comes<00:04:13.620> out

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
pearl scale angelfish when he comes out

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.279 
pearl scale angelfish when he comes out

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.460 
look kind of kind of bland right now
because<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.389> don't<00:05:00.450> have<00:05:00.720> any<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.169> actinic

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
because I don't have any of the actinic

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.320

sore<00:05:01.830> or<00:05:02.580> blue<00:05:03.000> LEDs<00:05:03.510> on<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:04.320> those<00:05:04.500> are<00:05:04.680> them

into<00:05:08.419> something<00:05:09.440> else<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.889> guess<00:05:11.729> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
into something else I guess the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.250 
into something else I guess the
chocolate<00:05:12.210> tank<00:05:12.450> who<00:05:12.630> looks<00:05:12.900> like<00:05:13.020> he's<00:05:13.139> got

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
chocolate tank who looks like he's got

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.930 
chocolate tank who looks like he's got
some<00:05:13.440> damage<00:05:13.830> on<00:05:13.950> his<00:05:14.130> fin<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.610> wonder<00:05:14.850> where

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
some damage on his fin I wonder where

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.780 
some damage on his fin I wonder where
that<00:05:14.970> came<00:05:15.210> from<00:05:15.270> maybe<00:05:15.630> he<00:05:16.370> maybe<00:05:17.370> he<00:05:17.610> went

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
that came from maybe he maybe he went

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.540 
that came from maybe he maybe he went
into<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.150> powerhead<00:05:18.630> accidentally<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:20.370> was
