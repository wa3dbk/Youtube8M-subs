hardly<00:00:36.600> seen<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.680> shark<00:00:37.950> skin<00:00:38.190> lines

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
hardly seen the shark skin lines

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
hardly seen the shark skin lines
sharkskin<00:00:39.899> lines<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> new<00:00:40.980> idea<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.579> 3m<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
sharkskin lines was a new idea by 3m and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.930 
sharkskin lines was a new idea by 3m and
it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.570> great<00:00:42.840> idea<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> concept<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's a great idea the concept was to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's a great idea the concept was to
make<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> line<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.899> instead<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.469> being<00:00:46.680> smooth

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
make a line that instead of being smooth

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
make a line that instead of being smooth
has<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> texture<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.600> does<00:00:48.930> for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
has a texture to it what this does for

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.639 
has a texture to it what this does for
you<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:50.700> creates<00:00:51.629> less<00:00:51.930> friction<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you is it creates less friction on your

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.350 
you is it creates less friction on your
guides<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.340> also<00:00:53.699> less<00:00:53.910> friction<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
guides and also less friction on the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
guides and also less friction on the
water<00:00:54.719> stint<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> surface<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:55.920> water

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
water stint on the surface for water

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
water stint on the surface for water
tension<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.059> easier<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> lift<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
tension so it's easier to lift the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.529 
tension so it's easier to lift the
lineup<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:58.590> its<00:00:58.800> greater<00:00:59.760> cast<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.210> distance

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
lineup also its greater cast in distance

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
lineup also its greater cast in distance
because<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> less<00:01:01.079> friction<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> line<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
because of less friction on the line the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.780 
because of less friction on the line the
problem<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.870> such<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.790> heavy

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
problem was that it was such a heavy

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
problem was that it was such a heavy
texture<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> shark<00:01:07.229> skin<00:01:07.409> line<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.340> int

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

texture on the shark skin line as an int
applies<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.229> some<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:10.979> complained

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
applies that it some people complained

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.520 
applies that it some people complained
about<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> noise<00:01:12.000> gundry<00:01:12.780> guides<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> also

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
about the noise gundry guides and also

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
about the noise gundry guides and also
some<00:01:13.770> people<00:01:13.979> complained<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.430> possible

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
some people complained about possible

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
some people complained about possible
abrasion<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> line<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.740> through<00:01:16.890> your

abrasion of line going through your

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.270 
abrasion of line going through your
hands<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> scientific<00:01:19.409> angler<00:01:19.710> came<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.100> with

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
hands so scientific angler came out with

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
hands so scientific angler came out with
just<00:01:20.880> their<00:01:21.030> standard<00:01:21.390> text<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.900> line<00:01:22.080> which

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
just their standard text your line which

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
just their standard text your line which
got<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> falls<00:01:23.100> halfway<00:01:23.490> between<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
got it falls halfway between the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630 
got it falls halfway between the
standard<00:01:24.180> mastery<00:01:24.570> line<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.430> shark<00:01:26.430> skin

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
standard mastery line and the shark skin

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
standard mastery line and the shark skin
line<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.479> quite<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.840> heavily<00:01:28.200> textured<00:01:28.590> as

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
line not quite as heavily textured as

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219 
line not quite as heavily textured as
the<00:01:28.920> shark<00:01:29.130> skin<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> has<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> same

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the shark skin but it has the same

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.490 
the shark skin but it has the same
advantages<00:01:33.200> basically<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.439> were

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
advantages basically what they were

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
advantages basically what they were

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
trying to do scientific anglers wanted

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
trying to do scientific anglers wanted
to<00:01:36.420> create<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> ultimate<00:01:36.750> dry<00:01:37.439> fly<00:01:37.680> line<00:01:37.950> for

to create the ultimate dry fly line for
spooky<00:01:38.700> trout<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.320> 90-foot<00:01:40.829> line<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.369> has

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
spooky trout it's a 90-foot line it has

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.170 
spooky trout it's a 90-foot line it has
a<00:01:42.299> compound<00:01:42.899> taper<00:01:43.369> it's<00:01:44.369> basically<00:01:44.700> designed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
a compound taper it's basically designed

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.859 
a compound taper it's basically designed
for<00:01:45.509> both<00:01:45.659> long<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> short<00:01:46.610> casts<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.869> mean

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
for both long and short casts I mean

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
for both long and short casts I mean
it's<00:01:49.020> great<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> line<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> costs<00:01:50.369> 90<00:01:50.820> feet

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's great of a line that costs 90 feet

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.749 
it's great of a line that costs 90 feet
but<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.350> when<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.040> talking<00:01:53.399> spooky

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
but for me when you're talking spooky

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.359 
but for me when you're talking spooky
trout<00:01:54.030> you're<00:01:54.630> usually<00:01:54.780> making<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.439> 30<00:01:55.770> 40<00:01:56.159> foot

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
trout you're usually making a 30 40 foot

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.389 
trout you're usually making a 30 40 foot
cast<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.360> needs<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> accurate<00:01:58.399> that's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
cast and it needs to be accurate that's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
cast and it needs to be accurate that's
what<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.700> line<00:01:59.939> does<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.719> again<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
what this line does but then again it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
what this line does but then again it
also<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> design<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.790> taper

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
also because the design and the taper

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.600 
also because the design and the taper
will<00:02:03.780> allow<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.590> 70<00:02:05.070> 80<00:02:05.250> feet<00:02:05.460> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
will allow you to put out 70 80 feet of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
will allow you to put out 70 80 feet of
line<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.119> need<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.719> still<00:02:06.990> put

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
line so if you need to you can still put

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
line so if you need to you can still put
out<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> distance<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> very

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
out the distance but it's a very

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.139 
out the distance but it's a very
accurate<00:02:08.849> line

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
accurate line

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.140 
accurate line
has<00:02:10.659> a<00:02:10.689> very<00:02:11.310> short<00:02:12.310> head<00:02:12.519> design<00:02:12.909> which

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
has a very short head design which

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 
has a very short head design which
optimizes<00:02:13.689> presentation<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:15.159> has<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> long

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
optimizes presentation it has a long

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.899 
optimizes presentation it has a long

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
belly the front taped of this line is 13

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.170 
belly the front taped of this line is 13
feet<00:02:18.939> long<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:20.319> overall<00:02:20.739> belly<00:02:21.489> front<00:02:22.030> end

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
feet long the overall belly front end

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.479 
feet long the overall belly front end
rear<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.659> 30<00:02:23.049> feet<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.409> then<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.799> rear<00:02:23.920> taper

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
rear is 30 feet and then the rear taper

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.970 
rear is 30 feet and then the rear taper
is<00:02:24.700> 25<00:02:25.239> feet<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.629> gives<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.900> 69<00:02:26.260> feet<00:02:26.709> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
is 25 feet that gives you 69 feet of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.890 
is 25 feet that gives you 69 feet of
total<00:02:27.489> taper<00:02:27.849> blind<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.329> is<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:28.720> that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
total taper blind this is because that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.380 
total taper blind this is because that
length<00:02:29.290> though<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.709> also<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:30.280> gives<00:02:30.609> you<00:02:30.790> some

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
length though it also now gives you some

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.819 
length though it also now gives you some
of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> advantages<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.560> very

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
of the advantages of it's very

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.380 
of the advantages of it's very
consistent<00:02:33.340> breaking<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.790> coming<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.180> off<00:02:34.239> the

consistent breaking it coming it off the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.020 
consistent breaking it coming it off the
water<00:02:34.540> also<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.680> allow<00:02:36.189> you<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.459> do<00:02:37.000> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
water also you can allow you to do a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.080 
water also you can allow you to do a
roll<00:02:37.780> cast<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.280> there<00:02:39.430> are<00:02:39.489> those<00:02:39.579> times<00:02:39.640> we've
