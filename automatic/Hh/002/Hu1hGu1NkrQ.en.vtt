00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Your hands are clean. Duster gets better than that. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 First of all, crashed ice into a large old fashioned dog glass (rock glass). 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 You may use a special scoop or spoon, etc. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Because the work is surprisingly dull (laughs) In our shop, we use a slightly modified version of the colander and put in at once. It is good to be drained. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 It is full of energy. Once you set it aside. It is to cool the glass. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Cut the lime in the meantime. Let's polish the skin well. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 In fine detail. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 When it is large, the pressure is applied to the skin more than necessary when crushing it, and the bitterness becomes strong. But you like this side. 8 00: 01: 12,000-&gt; 00: 01: 10,000 It is better to take the core. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Depending on the season, it may contain fine seeds, so if you cut it like this, you will get it quickly. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 This is also the way to squeeze the whole citrus juice, such as lemon, orange and grapefruit. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Go to the top of the tambour shaker. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Add sugar to it and crush well with pestle (pestol). 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Do not overwhelm it too much. It feels soft and stuffy. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Pour the cassava (pinga). It is hard to fade when frozen. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Transfer the crushed glass of rock glass (which is cold enough) to the body of the shaker. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I will drain the water. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Put the previous ingredients there and cover the top as it is. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And shake. Rhythmically. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Because the ice is fine, you don't need to shake it big and strong. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Use snaps to make them short and compact. It is enough to feel lightly stirred. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Remove the top and pour as it is. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Oh my wonder, a glass of crushed crushed ice was in it, but the liquor and half a whole lime was completely contained. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Prepare the lime dispersion and finish. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Serve with a straw. To be on the right. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 A variety of applications and arrangements of this "Caipirinha", advanced back-tech and commentary of the key point are separately in the cocktail course.
