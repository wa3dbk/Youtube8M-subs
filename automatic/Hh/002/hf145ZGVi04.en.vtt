00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.233
- Last week, we met a woman
in our audience

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:04.333
who was really excited
to smell me.

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.333
[cheers and laughter]

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.533
Take a look.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.700
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.666
My mom wants to know what
you smell like.

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.166
- How do I smell?
- You smell so good.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.400
- Oh, okay.
- Mom, she smells so good.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.033
- Yeah.
- She smells so good.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.433
[laughter]
Oh, my God!

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.000
- Cards, the deck of cards.
- They have to--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What they do in between
the games.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.333
- Shuffle.
- Yes!

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.300
Oh, you got it!
Okay.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.166
She's gonna have a really,
really good one.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.166
- Bachelorette party!
Wedding!

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.900
A wedding.
- No--yes, yes, yes!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.933
Yes!

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.800
- You're gonna go to Vegas!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.333
[cheers and applause]

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.366
Yes!

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.233
- [squeals]
- Playing slots, yes!

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.166
- Ellen!
- [imitates Lori screaming]

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.500
[laughter]
Lori, where are you?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.566
Come on down!

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.733
So--and you--
you teach second grade?

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.200
- I teach second grade.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.933
My town of Lacombe is about
10,000 people or so.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.166
We have a really small school,

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.966
and I've taught there
for eight years.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.300
So I had all these kids coming
up to me from K to 9

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.233
and just so incredibly happy
for me.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.133
And they know, like,
I'm--I'm your girl, Ellen!

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.933
[laughter]
They know that about me!

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.133
[laughter and applause]

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.900
So they were so happy--
- You're my girl.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.433
- That I got to meet you--
they got to see me meet you,

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.133
and that is a lesson that--

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.733
- Well, it's--what's wonderful,
and we didn't even know this,

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.033
you incorporate my show
into your classes.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.233
- All the time.
I have--

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.500
I--to trick them into getting
back to class fast after recess,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.600
to put shoes on, get in,
I'll show an Ellen video.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.533
So they know that
I'm going to show a video.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.966
They don't want to miss it,
so it gets them--

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.366
[snaps fingers]
in the class in a hurry.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.000
- And then you have
Pay It Forward Wednesday.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.866
- I do, I have
the "Be kind to one another"

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.966
right outside my classroom.

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.533
We hang it in our home,
and then

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.433
my daughter and son
and my other daughter,

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.766
we started doing
Pay It Forward Wednesdays,

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.133
just totally--
[starting to cry]

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.133
totally based on what
you've taught me.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.733
- Aw.
- And yeah--

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.233
- You're so sweet.
- We just buy a coffee,

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:47.300
and bring it to somebody,
or we--

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.233
see--see somebody gardening,
and--

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.866
and often my daughter doesn't
say, like,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.900
"Mommy taught me that,"
she says "Ellen taught me that."

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.266
- Aw.
- I know!

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.266
- That's so sweet.
- And you get all the credit.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.700
I'm okay with that.
[laughter]

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.166
It's okay.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.900
Well, it's--it's really sweet
that you do that,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.966
and that you encourage kids
especially,

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.800
'cause that's when you need to
start, is,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.466
teaching them random acts of
kindness and pay it forward,

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:12.266
and since today is
Pay It Forward Wednesday,

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.300
I'm going to start
doing that myself.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.200
So it is Wednesday today,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.466
and I'm going to pay it forward
with you,

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:20.566
and you're--what I'm going to
give you--

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.266
- Oh, don't.
I don't know if we can do this.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.766
[laughter]

00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.833
I don't know if I can do this.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.166
[audience screams loudly]

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:37.266
[funky music]
[audience cheers]

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.533
[exclaiming indistinctly]

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:44.366
Oh, my gosh!

00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:46.000
- Look at this!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.766
- Oh, my God, Ellen!

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:49.966
- So...
- Oh, my God--

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:51.733
- Here's--here's the thing.

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:52.933
- Can I sit in it?
- Yeah, you can sit in it.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.000
- [squeals]

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.466
[laughter]

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.900
- So...

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.200
my friends at Ford heard
about you, and, uh,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.633
they love that you teach,
and that you want to--

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.400
your kids to pay it forward,
and you want--

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.266
They want you to make
a difference in the world,

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:08.300
and they want to give you--
and help you go further

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.700
with a brand new Ford Flex,
which is what this car is.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.900
It's a--
[cheers and applause]

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.000
- Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful!
I love it!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.166
- I know!

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.666
- It doesn't smell funny,
like my van!

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.566
- No, it doesn't.
I know.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.400
We'll talk about your car
when we come back.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.766
We'll be back.

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:28.833
[funky music]
[cheers and applause]

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.633
I didn't want you to think that
we were doing anything,

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.800
but tell everybody about your
car--what do you drive now?

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.066
- Well, we just--we have a van,
and we're frugal people,

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.466
and we just--

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:39.633
We have a van and it's great
and it fits our kids,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:41.666
and it's good but,
it just never felt like ours.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.266
It's kind of smelly?
- Mm-hmm.

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.566
- Now I feel like
I'm all about smells.

00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:45.933
That one smells good, like--
- Yeah.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.700
- It just feels like
it's not ours, and it--

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.300
- Lots of miles on it.
- It has lots of miles,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.700
- Lots, lots of miles.
- Yeah, we--

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.566
And we work really hard
to make those choices

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:58.833
for our family and our kids and,
that vehicle will just--

00:03:58.833 --> 00:03:59.833
- That's gonna be great.
- Make such a difference

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.000
in our lives.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.433
- It's gonna be great.
- It will.

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:04.133
- And what I love about you
also, your family is adorable.

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:06.500
And you know what they do,
when they sit down and watch

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.800
The 12 Days of Giveaways--

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.333
This is what they do,
I have a copy of it.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.433
- You don't.
- You--you actually--

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.566
write down
what we're giving away,

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:18.400
and you fantasize about who you
would give these things to.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.200
You write down who you'd give
something to.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.500
That's how much you
pay it forward.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.066
You actually would give those
things to somebody else,

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.033
and again,
that's just so amazing.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.300
So we want to give you
everything we've given away

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.700
on all of our 12 Days last--
- Oh, my God.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.866
- Last--last Christmas,
okay?

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:35.333
["It's The Most Wonderful Time
of the Year" plays]

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:36.766
[cheers and applause]

00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:38.066
- [screams]

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.233
Oh, my God!

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:47.266
You are crazy!

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:50.000
Oh, my God, you are crazy!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.033
Oh, my God!
