secret is made they start with various
basic<00:00:11.280> shapes<00:00:11.730> that's<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.869> key<00:00:13.199> to<00:00:13.409> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
basic shapes that's the key to the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.980 
basic shapes that's the key to the
construction<00:00:14.339> of<00:00:15.080> our<00:00:16.080> work<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.560> general<00:00:17.990> here

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

construction of our work in general here
we<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> mountain<00:00:21.050> now<00:00:22.050> I've<00:00:22.200> got<00:00:22.350> to

we have a mountain now I've got to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
we have a mountain now I've got to
determine<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> where<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.580> dragon<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
determine the where that dragon is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.130 
determine the where that dragon is
located<00:00:24.840> relative<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> mountain<00:00:27.140> once

again<00:00:28.350> we<00:00:29.039> employ<00:00:29.430> basic<00:00:30.120> shapes<00:00:32.719> here<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.870> can

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
again we employ basic shapes here we can

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.709 
again we employ basic shapes here we can
get<00:00:34.789> shaped<00:00:35.789> with<00:00:36.030> Dragons<00:00:36.539> neck<00:00:38.719> dragon's
