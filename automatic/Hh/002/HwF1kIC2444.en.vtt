20<00:01:51.360> extra<00:01:51.720> damage<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> turns<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.460> you're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
20 extra damage so it turns out you're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
20 extra damage so it turns out you're
better<00:01:54.659> off<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:55.350> using<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.979> jarate<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> begin

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
better off not using the jarate to begin

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.679 
better off not using the jarate to begin
with<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
with if you're going to do this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
with if you're going to do this
stipulation<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.350> course<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.219> let's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
stipulation of course because let's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
stipulation of course because let's
think<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> throw<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
think of it like this when you throw the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.920 
think of it like this when you throw the
jarate<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.500> takes<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:02.240> three<00:02:03.240> seconds<00:02:03.780> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
jarate it takes about three seconds for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.969 
jarate it takes about three seconds for
you<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> throw<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> jarate

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you to throw the jarate

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
you to throw the jarate
get<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.700> weapon<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.329> ready<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> shoot

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
get your weapon back up ready to shoot

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.839 
get your weapon back up ready to shoot
so<00:02:07.409> after<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.340> shoot<00:02:08.610> somebody

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
so after that when you shoot somebody

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.309 
so after that when you shoot somebody
let's<00:02:09.149> say<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.270> connect<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.780> someone<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
let's say you connect with someone it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
let's say you connect with someone it
does<00:02:10.560> 68<00:02:11.400> damage<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.450> fantastic

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
does 68 damage that's fantastic

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200 
does 68 damage that's fantastic
but<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.070> time<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.430> takes<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.730> pull<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
but in the time it takes to pull out the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.930 
but in the time it takes to pull out the
rifle<00:02:15.480> after<00:02:16.170> throwing<00:02:16.350> out<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> jarate<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
rifle after throwing out the jarate you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.730 
rifle after throwing out the jarate you
could<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.240> potentially<00:02:18.780> already<00:02:19.200> noscopes

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
could have potentially already noscopes

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.920 
could have potentially already noscopes
two<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:20.100> three<00:02:20.310> times<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.910> done<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.480> damage

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
two or three times and done more damage

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560 
two or three times and done more damage
than<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.590> jarate<00:02:23.010> shot<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.450> that

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
than that one jarate shot so with that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.180 
than that one jarate shot so with that
out<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> way<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.800> kind<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> goes

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
out of the way with that kind of goes

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.640 
out of the way with that kind of goes
over<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.550> whole<00:02:26.700> process<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.570> how<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.380> setup

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
over the whole process of how this setup

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
over the whole process of how this setup
works<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.370> told<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> that's<00:02:30.300> very<00:02:30.540> very

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
works I told you that's very very

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.870 
works I told you that's very very
difficult<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.800> hard<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
difficult this is so hard to do this I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.330 
difficult this is so hard to do this I
only<00:02:33.420> got<00:02:33.690> maybe<00:02:33.930> two<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:34.500> three<00:02:34.530> kills<00:02:35.070> in<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
only got maybe two or three kills in a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.710 
only got maybe two or three kills in a
row<00:02:35.520> before<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.970> would<00:02:36.209> get<00:02:36.300> killed<00:02:36.540> by

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
row before I would get killed by

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.230 
row before I would get killed by
somebody<00:02:36.990> it's<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.830> super<00:02:38.400> super<00:02:38.640> hard<00:02:39.000> and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
somebody it's just super super hard and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.120 
somebody it's just super super hard and
I<00:02:39.630> came<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.020> conclusion<00:02:40.110> while<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> was

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
I came to the conclusion while I was

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.610 
I came to the conclusion while I was
doing<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.670> I'm<00:02:41.940> pretty<00:02:42.900> much<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.140> gimped

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
doing this I'm pretty much a gimped

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.070 
doing this I'm pretty much a gimped
scout<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.160> here<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.240> explanation<00:02:45.660> for

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
scout and here is my explanation for

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.740 
scout and here is my explanation for
that<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.890> I'm<00:02:47.040> using<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.459> hip<00:02:47.730> firing<00:02:48.060> hitscan

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that so I'm using a hip firing hitscan

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.229 
that so I'm using a hip firing hitscan
weapon<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.950> only<00:02:49.980> other<00:02:50.489> classes<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> have

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
weapon the only other classes that have

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.750 
weapon the only other classes that have
hitscan<00:02:51.510> weapons<00:02:51.600> are<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.620> soldier<00:02:53.130> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
hitscan weapons are the soldier the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
hitscan weapons are the soldier the
scout<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> engineer<00:02:54.930> now<00:02:55.530> I'm<00:02:55.709> not<00:02:55.860> going

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
scout and the engineer now I'm not going

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.800 
scout and the engineer now I'm not going
to<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.220> count<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.580> pistol<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.060> much<00:02:57.420> or

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to really count the pistol that much or

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
to really count the pistol that much or
really<00:02:58.290> any<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> melee<00:02:59.130> items<00:02:59.489> because

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
really any of the melee items because

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.220 
really any of the melee items because
those<00:02:59.910> are<00:03:00.090> technically<00:03:00.420> hitscan<00:03:00.780> as<00:03:00.989> well

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
those are technically hitscan as well

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.820 
those are technically hitscan as well
I'm<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:02.040> talking<00:03:02.400> primary<00:03:02.910> or<00:03:03.090> secondary<00:03:03.830> so

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
I'm just talking primary or secondary so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.970 
I'm just talking primary or secondary so
I<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.489> scatter<00:03:06.030> gun<00:03:06.270> as<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.450> sniper

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
I have a scatter gun as the sniper

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.830 
I have a scatter gun as the sniper
except<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.130> shoots<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.520> whole<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.850> slower<00:03:09.150> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
except it shoots a whole lot slower it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.110 
except it shoots a whole lot slower it
does<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> hell<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.890> lot<00:03:11.040> less<00:03:11.250> damage<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
does a hell of a lot less damage and it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
does a hell of a lot less damage and it
only<00:03:12.239> shoots<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:13.230> pellet<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.480> run<00:03:15.780> slower

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
only shoots one pellet and I run slower

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.500 
only shoots one pellet and I run slower
I<00:03:16.440> don't<00:03:16.890> run<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.160> fast<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.610> scout<00:03:17.790> either<00:03:18.030> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
I don't run as fast as a scout either so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.410 
I don't run as fast as a scout either so
when<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.780> play<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.230> setup<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.980> sniper

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
when you play this setup as the sniper

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.490 
when you play this setup as the sniper
essentially<00:03:21.420> you're<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.600> taking<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.110> scout

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
essentially you're just taking the scout

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.680 
essentially you're just taking the scout
clubbing<00:03:23.459> him<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> head<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> bowling

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
clubbing him in the head with a bowling

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.720 
clubbing him in the head with a bowling
pin<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:25.590> letting<00:03:25.860> him<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.280> spawn

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
pin and then letting him out of spawn

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190 
pin and then letting him out of spawn
and<00:03:26.940> saying<00:03:27.150> okay<00:03:27.390> go<00:03:27.540> kill<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.840> red<00:03:27.959> team<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and saying okay go kill the red team and

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.449 
and saying okay go kill the red team and

he's like yo what time is it and it
really<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.790> no<00:03:33.090> surprise<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.630> when<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.200> go

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
really is no surprise that when you go

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.289 
really is no surprise that when you go
up<00:03:34.470> against<00:03:34.799> any<00:03:34.980> other<00:03:35.190> class<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:36.090> any

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
up against any other class really any

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.930 
up against any other class really any
other<00:03:36.660> class<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.830> very<00:03:38.190> hard<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.549> kill<00:03:38.790> them

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
other class it is very hard to kill them

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.940 
other class it is very hard to kill them
and<00:03:39.060> they<00:03:39.390> are<00:03:39.540> gonna<00:03:39.660> get<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.049> probably<00:03:40.560> 80%

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
and they are gonna get you probably 80%

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.819 
and they are gonna get you probably 80%
of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> time<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.720> does<00:03:43.049> not<00:03:43.079> mean<00:03:43.650> this

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
of the time but that does not mean this

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.250 
of the time but that does not mean this
is<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.160> fun<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.910> should<00:03:45.420> not<00:03:45.600> be<00:03:45.660> tried<00:03:46.110> at

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
is not fun and should not be tried at

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960 
is not fun and should not be tried at
least<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.590> couple<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:47.040> times<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.640> took<00:03:47.790> me

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
least a couple of times and it took me

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.640 
least a couple of times and it took me
like<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.269> said<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> while<00:03:48.780> before<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.230> got<00:03:49.440> this

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
like I said a while before I got this

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860 
like I said a while before I got this
down<00:03:49.950> before<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.640> got<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.970> actual<00:03:51.239> strategy

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
down before I got the actual strategy

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
down before I got the actual strategy
down<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.799> is<00:03:52.920> really<00:03:53.100> cool<00:03:53.400> when<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.760> kill

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
down but it is really cool when you kill

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.789 
down but it is really cool when you kill
one<00:03:54.269> or<00:03:54.299> two<00:03:54.420> people<00:03:54.690> like<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.350> it's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
one or two people like that it's it's

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.030 
one or two people like that it's it's
very<00:03:55.890> interesting<00:03:56.190> makes<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.790> feel<00:03:57.000> good<00:03:58.040> so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
very interesting makes you feel good so

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.650 
very interesting makes you feel good so
here<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.610> couple<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.940> examples<00:04:00.239> of

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
here are just a couple of examples of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.449 
here are just a couple of examples of
how<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.870> got<00:04:01.200> these<00:04:01.380> kills<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:02.100> you're<00:04:02.220> seeing

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
how I got these kills that you're seeing

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.340 
how I got these kills that you're seeing
so<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.120> soldier<00:04:03.480> hits<00:04:03.660> me<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.959> rocket<00:04:04.290> I

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
so this soldier hits me with a rocket I

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.900 
so this soldier hits me with a rocket I
know<00:04:04.410> for<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.860> fact<00:04:04.920> he's<00:04:05.370> coming<00:04:05.640> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.790> room

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
know for a fact he's coming in the room

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.340 
know for a fact he's coming in the room
and<00:04:06.060> sure<00:04:06.209> enough<00:04:06.239> there<00:04:06.630> he<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.780> right<00:04:07.140> in<00:04:07.290> his

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
and sure enough there he is right in his

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.800 
and sure enough there he is right in his
face<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.489> had<00:04:08.670> thrown<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.090> jarate<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.630> him

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
face if I had thrown the jarate at him

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.810 
face if I had thrown the jarate at him
when<00:04:10.170> he<00:04:10.260> came<00:04:10.440> into<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> room<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.040> probably

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
when he came into the room I probably

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.600 
when he came into the room I probably
would<00:04:12.269> have<00:04:12.390> died<00:04:12.630> he<00:04:13.560> turns<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.980> corner<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
would have died he turns that corner and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.180 
would have died he turns that corner and
shoots<00:04:14.880> one<00:04:15.269> rocket<00:04:15.780> at<00:04:15.900> me<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.229> will<00:04:16.500> explode

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
shoots one rocket at me I will explode

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.009 
shoots one rocket at me I will explode
all<00:04:17.489> over<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.850> walls<00:04:18.120> all<00:04:18.419> over<00:04:18.450> all<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> nice

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
all over the walls all over all the nice

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.960 
all over the walls all over all the nice
paintings<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.919> room<00:04:20.220> there<00:04:20.760> are<00:04:20.880> no

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
paintings in that room but you get the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.430 
paintings in that room but you get the
idea<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.979> would<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.430> instantly<00:04:23.849> died<00:04:24.440> so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
idea I would have instantly died so

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.960 
idea I would have instantly died so
killing<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.919> Scout<00:04:26.280> right<00:04:26.580> there<00:04:26.820> is<00:04:26.940> a

killing that Scout right there is a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.379 
killing that Scout right there is a
pretty

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
pretty

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.929 
pretty
of<00:04:28.080> knowing<00:04:28.530> when<00:04:28.740> somebody<00:04:29.189> is<00:04:29.400> trying<00:04:29.729> to

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:29.939 
of knowing when somebody is trying to

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.879 
of knowing when somebody is trying to
get<00:04:30.150> health<00:04:30.389> because<00:04:31.080> as<00:04:31.259> you<00:04:31.409> saw<00:04:31.590> he<00:04:31.740> was

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
get health because as you saw he was

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.649 
get health because as you saw he was
jumping<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.550> over<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.879> place<00:04:32.969> trying<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.509> get

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
jumping all over the place trying to get

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.260 
jumping all over the place trying to get
over<00:04:33.900> me<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.379> I<00:04:34.979> was<00:04:35.159> certain<00:04:35.490> if<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.699> put<00:04:35.939> one

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
over me and I was certain if I put one

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.820 
over me and I was certain if I put one
bullet<00:04:36.539> into<00:04:36.840> him<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.169> would<00:04:37.349> have<00:04:37.379> killed<00:04:37.710> him

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
bullet into him I would have killed him

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.369 
bullet into him I would have killed him
and<00:04:38.009> those<00:04:38.550> two<00:04:38.789> examples<00:04:38.969> know<00:04:39.659> jarate<00:04:40.139> was

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
and those two examples know jarate was

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.800 
and those two examples know jarate was
thrown<00:04:40.710> at<00:04:40.979> all<00:04:41.279> and<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.419> course<00:04:42.569> goes

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
thrown at all and that of course goes

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.929 
thrown at all and that of course goes
back<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.169> my<00:04:43.259> previous<00:04:43.469> point<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:44.219> me<00:04:44.729> not

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
back to my previous point of me not

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.369 
back to my previous point of me not
using<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.360> jarate<00:04:45.629> and<00:04:45.840> how<00:04:45.930> it's<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.199> little

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
using the jarate and how it's a little

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.249 
using the jarate and how it's a little
easier<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.860> not<00:04:47.189> throw<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.699> jarate<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:49.110> while

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
easier to not throw the jarate so while

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.050 
easier to not throw the jarate so while
this<00:04:49.439> commentary<00:04:49.830> comes<00:04:50.099> to<00:04:50.249> a<00:04:50.279> close<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:51.029> just
