00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.520
The hosts of next year's Te Matatini
are mediating a conflict

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.600
between a Northland kapa haka
and a Christchurch hotel.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.600
Hatea has been forced to look
for another place to stay

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880
during the five-day festival,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.680
after their initial booking
with the Redwood Hotel fell through

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.840
with claims the rejection
is race-based.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.640
The melodic sound of Hatea.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.800
A sound that could be missed
at next year's Te Matatini

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.440
because the team may not have
a place to stay in Christchurch.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920
Up until the weekend gone,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.840
this is where Northland
haka group Hatea believed

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.160
they were staying next March.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
But yesterday,
an informal complaint was made

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.480
by one of the group's leaders.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.400
Aside from the angry tone
the message carries,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000
it's this challenge
to the host committee

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.080
that's caught a lot of attention,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760
with many assuming the reason
behind the hotel rejecting the team

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.960
is race-based.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.520
And even though
it's an informal complaint,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.920
it still caught the eyes
of the South Island's leaders.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.560
But they're still waiting to hear
back from Hatea.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.440
Te Tai Tonga MP
is playing along to the same tune.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.400
Representatives from Hatea
weren't speaking to the media,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.440
leaving the matter instead
to social media.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.640
It's still hoped that Hatea will be
seen at Te Matatini next year.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.040
Oriini Tipene-Leach, Te Karere.
