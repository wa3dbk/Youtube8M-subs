00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
products let's hear the founder of the
company<00:00:22.289> explaining<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> conception<00:00:23.640> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
company explaining the conception of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:42.049 
company explaining the conception of
virtual<00:00:24.300> packet<00:00:39.110> size<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
virtual packet size so if you need to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.900 
virtual packet size so if you need to
deploy<00:00:42.360> 30<00:00:43.020> Network<00:00:43.379> before<00:00:44.129> City<00:00:44.730> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
deploy 30 Network before City for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.139 
deploy 30 Network before City for
example<00:00:45.170> it<00:00:46.170> spends<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.860> lot<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> money<00:00:47.730> for

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
example it spends a lot of money for

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.010 
example it spends a lot of money for
infrastructure

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
infrastructure

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.299 
infrastructure
this<00:00:49.410> means<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.160> need<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> spend<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> same

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
this means you need to spend the same

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
this means you need to spend the same
investment<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:54.030> each<00:00:54.270> CD<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.390> main<00:00:57.750> idea

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
investment to each CD so our main idea

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.880 
investment to each CD so our main idea
is<00:00:58.559> dividing<00:00:59.430> packets<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.649> two<00:01:01.649> different

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is dividing packets go to two different

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.539 
is dividing packets go to two different
parts<00:01:02.370> controller<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> data<00:01:03.719> plane<00:01:04.400> what<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
parts controller and data plane what is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.130 
parts controller and data plane what is
what's<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> benefit<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.430> can

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
what's the benefit of this so you can

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
what's the benefit of this so you can
implement<00:01:10.140> everything<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.520> easy<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.180> one

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
implement everything very easy from one

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.859 
implement everything very easy from one
cloud<00:01:13.640> for<00:01:14.640> example<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> need<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
cloud for example if you need to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.240 
cloud for example if you need to
implement<00:01:17.000> 30<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.869> city<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.100> need

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
implement 30 in for city we just need

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.130 
implement 30 in for city we just need
