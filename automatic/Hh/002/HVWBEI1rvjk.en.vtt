00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
this is the way all bicycle pedals are

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.840 
this is the way all bicycle pedals are
mounted<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:05.170> way<00:01:05.500> they<00:01:05.740> self<00:01:06.130> tighten<00:01:06.640> when

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
mounted that way they self tighten when

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.020 
mounted that way they self tighten when
about<00:01:07.180> when<00:01:07.420> fellow<00:01:07.840> with<00:01:08.020> writing<00:01:08.500> now<00:01:09.400> get

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
about when fellow with writing now get

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.000 
about when fellow with writing now get
the<00:01:10.150> chain<00:01:10.420> off<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.170> single-speed<00:01:11.620> chain

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
the chain off it's a single-speed chain

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.500 
the chain off it's a single-speed chain
it<00:01:12.190> happens<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.610> be<00:01:12.670> slack<00:01:12.970> enough<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.420> I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
it happens to be slack enough that I

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:26.210 
it happens to be slack enough that I
could<00:01:13.690> I<00:01:13.840> can<00:01:14.290> feed<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.740> off<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.300> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
could I can feed it off there we go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.710 
could I can feed it off there we go

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.770 
wrench and I was going ah ah which is
funny<00:02:12.200> making<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.680> tighter<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.820> let's<00:02:14.690> go

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
funny making it tighter so let's go

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.120 
funny making it tighter so let's go
ahead<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.260> doing<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> first

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.790 
ahead and I'm doing this for the first
time<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:16.880> did<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.720> once<00:02:17.990> before<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.410> my<00:02:18.620> old

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
time I did this once before on my old

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.590 
time I did this once before on my old
curry<00:02:19.130> bike<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.790> don't<00:02:20.090> believe<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.450> had<00:02:20.570> a

crank it's heavy but it's rock solid
it's<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.440> strongest<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.100> type<00:03:45.460> of<00:03:45.640> crank

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
it's the strongest like type of crank

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.790 
it's the strongest like type of crank
that<00:03:46.060> would<00:03:46.150> never<00:03:46.300> fatigue<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.380> break<00:03:47.590> on

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
you like sometimes aluminum cranks are

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.170 
you like sometimes aluminum cranks are
