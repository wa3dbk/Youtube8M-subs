00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
triangular section right up in here

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.690 
triangular section right up in here
taking<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.240> three<00:00:12.480> sections<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.700> starting

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
taking the three sections and starting

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.210 
taking the three sections and starting
it<00:00:14.820> like<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> regular<00:00:15.920> braid<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.980> ahead

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it like a regular braid and going ahead

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.609 
it like a regular braid and going ahead
and<00:00:23.369> grabbing<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.880> piece<00:00:24.269> from<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> top<00:00:24.619> like

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and grabbing a piece from the top like

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.929 
and grabbing a piece from the top like
you<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> French<00:00:26.369> braid<00:00:28.580> go<00:00:29.580> ahead<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you would as a French braid go ahead and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
you would as a French braid go ahead and
drop<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.300> bottom<00:00:30.630> piece<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.080> grab<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> piece

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
drop that bottom piece and grab a piece

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.930 
drop that bottom piece and grab a piece
equal<00:00:32.160> size<00:00:32.780> right<00:00:33.780> next<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:37.790> once<00:00:38.790> again

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
equal size right next to it once again

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.810 
equal size right next to it once again
repeat<00:00:39.210> grabbing<00:00:39.930> from<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> top<00:00:43.820> dropping

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
repeat grabbing from the top dropping

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:56.710 
repeat grabbing from the top dropping
and<00:00:45.120> grabbing<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> piece<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.050> next

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.030 

so<00:00:57.720> now<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.020> start<00:00:58.260> finishing<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
so now as we start finishing up the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.830 
so now as we start finishing up the
braid<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.700> ahead<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.060> braid<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.240> down<00:01:00.360> like<00:01:00.810> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
braid go ahead and braid it down like a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.770 
braid go ahead and braid it down like a
regular<00:01:01.260> braid<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.480> ahead<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
regular braid and we can go ahead and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
regular braid and we can go ahead and
clip<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.170> section<00:01:07.560> away<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:07.980> now<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> now

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
clip this section away right now so now

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.850 
clip this section away right now so now
that<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> waterfall<00:01:10.380> braid<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that we have the waterfall braid in

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
that we have the waterfall braid in
we're<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.370> start<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> variation

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
we're going to start the variation

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
we're going to start the variation
taking<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> pieces<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> dropped<00:01:14.160> go

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
taking the pieces that you dropped go

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
taking the pieces that you dropped go

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
ahead and braid them like a regular

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.990 
ahead and braid them like a regular
three<00:01:17.340> strand<00:01:17.370> braid

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
rub down the ends to keep them secure so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.090 
rub down the ends to keep them secure so
now<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.080> finished<00:01:30.380> braiding<00:01:30.740> all<00:01:30.979> the
