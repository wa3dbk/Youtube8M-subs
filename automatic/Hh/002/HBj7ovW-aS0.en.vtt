show<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.270> today<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.080> way<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.410> strumming

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
show you today is a way of strumming

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.500 
show you today is a way of strumming
with<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.430> plectrum<00:00:45.670> which<00:00:46.090> will<00:00:46.239> make<00:00:46.390> your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
with the plectrum which will make your

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.660 
with the plectrum which will make your
plane<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.020> much<00:00:47.230> more<00:00:47.470> interesting<00:00:48.129> because

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
plane so much more interesting because

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.939 
plane so much more interesting because
here's<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.120> thing<00:00:49.360> when<00:00:50.020> people<00:00:50.050> first<00:00:50.769> learn

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
here's the thing when people first learn

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.490 
here's the thing when people first learn
guitar<00:00:51.370> usually<00:00:51.729> they<00:00:52.510> just<00:00:52.540> strum<00:00:53.019> downwards

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
guitar usually they just strum downwards

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:04.030 
guitar usually they just strum downwards
with<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.769> plectrum<00:00:54.010> like<00:00:54.339> this

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.760 

and<00:01:04.670> that's<00:01:04.910> okay<00:01:05.300> but<00:01:05.510> after<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.840> while<00:01:06.080> you'll

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and that's okay but after a while you'll

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.140 
and that's okay but after a while you'll
find<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.340> starts<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.790> sound<00:01:07.940> quite

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
find that that starts to sound quite

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.180 
find that that starts to sound quite
boring<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.930> what<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:09.320> want<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.590> do<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.920> give<00:01:10.070> you

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
boring so what I want to do is give you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.950 
boring so what I want to do is give you
a<00:01:10.250> more<00:01:10.520> interest<00:01:10.970> in<00:01:11.120> strumming<00:01:11.570> pattern

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
a more interest in strumming pattern

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.080 
a more interest in strumming pattern
that<00:01:12.110> will<00:01:12.230> make<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.680> sound<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.460> know<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> lot

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
that will make it sound you know a lot

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.000 
that will make it sound you know a lot
more<00:01:14.270> alive<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.930> also<00:01:15.590> I'm<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.860> show

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
more alive and also I'm going to show

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.370 
more alive and also I'm going to show
you<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.160> new<00:01:16.370> chord<00:01:16.730> today<00:01:17.270> it's<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.720> G<00:01:18.080> chord

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
you a new chord today it's the G chord

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.310 
you a new chord today it's the G chord
and<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.850> strumming<00:01:20.150> pattern<00:01:20.660> is<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> Down

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
and so this strumming pattern is a Down

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.680 
and so this strumming pattern is a Down
stroke<00:01:22.000> an<00:01:23.000> upstroke<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:24.340> chop<00:01:25.340> I'll<00:01:26.300> explain

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
stroke an upstroke a chop I'll explain

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.560 
stroke an upstroke a chop I'll explain
that<00:01:26.870> in<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.080> minute<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.530> an<00:01:27.860> upstroke<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:29.420> when

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
that in a minute and an upstroke so when

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
that in a minute and an upstroke so when
we<00:01:29.660> put<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.020> together<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.560> sounds<00:01:30.710> like<00:01:30.860> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.690 

okay<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> gives<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
okay and you can see that it gives it a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
okay and you can see that it gives it a
more<00:01:47.880> interesting<00:01:48.329> sound<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> charm

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
more interesting sound because the charm

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
more interesting sound because the charm
is<00:01:50.340> quite<00:01:50.970> percussive<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.530> sounds<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
is quite percussive to me it sounds a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.170 
is quite percussive to me it sounds a
little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.430> drum<00:01:53.640> kit<00:01:53.880> when<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
little bit like a drum kit when the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
little bit like a drum kit when the
drummer<00:01:54.390> hits<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.840> snare<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.470> especially<00:01:56.430> if

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
drummer hits the snare and especially if
you're<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> sort<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.390> person<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:58.049> might<00:01:58.289> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you're the sort of person that might be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.649 
you're the sort of person that might be
you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.770> busking<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.640> own<00:01:59.789> or<00:02:00.149> playing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you know busking on your own or playing

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.960 
you know busking on your own or playing
acoustic<00:02:01.259> guitar<00:02:01.289> and<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.550 
acoustic guitar and it's really going to
be<00:02:03.030> useful<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:04.020> used<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.409> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
be useful for you to get used to this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.169 
be useful for you to get used to this
strumming<00:02:05.039> pattern<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.429> they<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:05.909> make

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
strumming pattern and they will make

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.639 
strumming pattern and they will make
your<00:02:06.299> plane<00:02:06.509> sound<00:02:06.869> much<00:02:07.259> better

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
your plane sound much better

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
your plane sound much better
okay<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.459> let's<00:02:08.849> begin<00:02:08.970> now<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.390> first<00:02:09.720> thing

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
okay so let's begin now the first thing

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
okay so let's begin now the first thing
I<00:02:10.019> want<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> show<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.890> new<00:02:11.130> core<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I want to show you is this new core of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.699 
I want to show you is this new core of
the<00:02:11.730> G<00:02:11.940> chord<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:13.260> you'll<00:02:13.380> find<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the G chord I think you'll find it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.290 
the G chord I think you'll find it
straightforward<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.819> middle<00:02:15.120> finger

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
straightforward it's the middle finger

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.320 
straightforward it's the middle finger
on<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.569> sixth<00:02:15.930> string<00:02:15.989> at<00:02:16.230> fret<00:02:16.260> 3<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:18.120> first

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
on the sixth string at fret 3 the first

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.870 
on the sixth string at fret 3 the first
finger<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.140> fifth<00:02:19.440> string<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:20.040> fret<00:02:20.310> 2<00:02:20.519> and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
finger on the fifth string of fret 2 and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.440 
finger on the fifth string of fret 2 and
then<00:02:21.420> these<00:02:21.569> two<00:02:21.840> fingers<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.239> third

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
then these two fingers the the third

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
then these two fingers the the third
finger<00:02:24.690> goes<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> second<00:02:25.590> string<00:02:25.739> at<00:02:25.890> fret

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
finger goes on the second string at fret

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
finger goes on the second string at fret
3<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.030> little<00:02:27.330> finger<00:02:27.510> goes<00:02:27.780> right<00:02:28.049> next

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
3 and the little finger goes right next

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
3 and the little finger goes right next
to<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.160> first<00:02:29.400> string<00:02:29.580> at<00:02:29.730> fret<00:02:29.760> 3<00:02:30.090> so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
to it on the first string at fret 3 so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.120 
to it on the first string at fret 3 so
if<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.049> just<00:02:31.200> want<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> look<00:02:31.620> at<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.830> chord

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
if you just want to look at that chord

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430 
if you just want to look at that chord
diagram<00:02:32.580> next<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> me<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.360> clarify<00:02:33.900> what

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
diagram next to me just to clarify what

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
diagram next to me just to clarify what
those<00:02:34.590> notes<00:02:34.860> are<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.910> use

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
those notes are and you're going to use

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.280 
those notes are and you're going to use
the<00:02:36.180> plectrum<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.750> strum<00:02:37.019> all<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.260> strings

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the plectrum to strum all the strings

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.350 
the plectrum to strum all the strings
now<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.950> should<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.579> by<00:02:40.819> now<00:02:40.849> if<00:02:41.239> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
now you should know by now if you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.729 
now you should know by now if you
remember<00:02:41.750> me<00:02:41.900> telling<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.439> the<00:02:42.560> last

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
remember me telling you in the last

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.709 
remember me telling you in the last
lesson<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.849> should<00:02:44.030> be<00:02:44.150> art<00:02:44.329> in<00:02:44.569> these

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
lesson that you should be art in these

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.420 
lesson that you should be art in these
fingers<00:02:45.170> up<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:45.739> should<00:02:45.890> be<00:02:45.920> plenty<00:02:46.219> of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
fingers up and there should be plenty of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 
fingers up and there should be plenty of
space<00:02:46.819> underneath<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:48.500> know<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.650> should

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
space underneath and you know you should

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.140 
space underneath and you know you should
be<00:02:48.920> holding<00:02:49.159> down<00:02:49.430> with<00:02:49.579> lots<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.879> pressure

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
be holding down with lots of pressure

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.479 
be holding down with lots of pressure
and<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.900> back<00:02:51.109> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.319> finger<00:02:51.859> shouldn't<00:02:52.340> be

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.520 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be
accidentally<00:02:53.329> touching<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.049> string<00:02:54.349> behind

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
accidentally touching the string behind

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.039 
accidentally touching the string behind
it<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.519> when<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.000> strum<00:02:56.390> all<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.599> all

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
it so that when you strum all the all

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.080 
it so that when you strum all the all
the<00:02:57.200> notes<00:02:57.409> it<00:02:57.769> should<00:02:57.980> sound<00:02:58.129> like<00:02:58.220> this

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.320 

nice<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.110> clean<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.680> clear<00:03:03.069> so<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.150> need

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
nice and clean and clear so if you need

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.790 
nice and clean and clear so if you need
to<00:03:04.360> practice<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:05.020> for<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.230> second<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.770> know

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
to practice that for a second you know

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.770 
to practice that for a second you know
by<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.220> means<00:03:06.430> pause<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.000> video<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.540> just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
by all means pause the video and just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.210 
by all means pause the video and just
make<00:03:08.140> sure<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.410> got<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.680> right

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
make sure you got that right

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.940 
make sure you got that right
so<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.970> strumming<00:03:10.450> pattern<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.739> we're<00:03:11.860> going

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
so this strumming pattern so we're going

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.500 
so this strumming pattern so we're going
to<00:03:12.010> strum<00:03:12.310> downwards<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.140> then<00:03:14.590> upwards<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to strum downwards and then upwards and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.720 
to strum downwards and then upwards and
then<00:03:16.690> we're<00:03:16.810> gonna<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.290> chop<00:03:17.650> right<00:03:18.519> so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
then we're gonna do this chop right so

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.580 
then we're gonna do this chop right so
let<00:03:18.880> me<00:03:19.000> explain<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.630> now<00:03:19.870> now<00:03:20.290> what<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
let me explain that now now what the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.190 
let me explain that now now what the
chop<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.099> is<00:03:21.370> we're<00:03:22.150> gonna<00:03:22.239> use<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.660> palm<00:03:22.959> of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
chop is is we're gonna use the palm of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.650 
chop is is we're gonna use the palm of
our<00:03:23.319> hand<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.190> touch<00:03:24.550> all<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.150> strings<00:03:25.480> like

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
our hand to touch all the strings like

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.920 
our hand to touch all the strings like
this<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.620> what<00:03:26.800> happens<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.459> our<00:03:27.760> hand<00:03:28.630> comes

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
this and what happens is our hand comes

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.930 
this and what happens is our hand comes
the<00:03:29.470> palm<00:03:29.680> touches<00:03:30.130> all<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.340> strings<00:03:30.640> and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
the palm touches all the strings and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.270 
the palm touches all the strings and
then<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.930> plectrum<00:03:32.140> follows<00:03:32.739> through

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
then the plectrum follows through

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.979 
then the plectrum follows through
but<00:03:33.430> because<00:03:34.060> we're<00:03:34.239> touching<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.660> strings

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
but because we're touching the strings

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.820 
but because we're touching the strings
all<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.410> notes<00:03:35.620> are<00:03:35.799> muted<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.830> now

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
all the notes are muted like that now

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.199 
all the notes are muted like that now
you<00:03:38.890> shouldn't<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.250> able<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.549> hear<00:03:39.730> any<00:03:39.910> notes

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.960 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes
at<00:03:40.450> all<00:03:40.630> if<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.989> can<00:03:41.019> hear<00:03:41.380> anything<00:03:41.970> like

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
at all if you can hear anything like

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.850 
at all if you can hear anything like
that<00:03:43.209> then<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.930> need<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.230> make<00:03:44.530> sure<00:03:44.680> you're

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
that then you need to make sure you're

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.500 
that then you need to make sure you're
holding<00:03:45.250> down<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.640> those<00:03:45.819> strings<00:03:46.180> with<00:03:46.360> more

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
holding down on those strings with more

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.930 
holding down on those strings with more
pressure<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.650> they<00:03:47.920> should<00:03:48.099> be<00:03:48.220> totally<00:03:48.670> dead

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.160 

so<00:03:51.940> that'll<00:03:52.299> take<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.510> little<00:03:52.750> bit<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.989> practice

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so that'll take a little bit of practice

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.830 
so that'll take a little bit of practice
and<00:03:53.769> eventually<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.239> bring<00:03:55.480> your<00:03:55.599> hand

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and eventually you can bring your hand

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.160 
and eventually you can bring your hand
down<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.880> chop<00:03:57.880> all<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.330> one<00:03:58.540> motion<00:03:58.720> like

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
down and chop all in one motion like

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.580 
down and chop all in one motion like
that<00:04:02.549> okay<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:04.090> just<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.510> clarify<00:04:04.750> I'll<00:04:05.350> tell

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.319 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell
you<00:04:05.680> again<00:04:05.890> make<00:04:06.250> sure<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.880> palm<00:04:07.180> of

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
you again make sure that the palm of

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.940 
you again make sure that the palm of
your<00:04:07.359> hand<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.840> laying<00:04:08.200> across<00:04:08.410> all<00:04:08.709> those

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
your hand is laying across all those

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.220 
your hand is laying across all those
strings<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> effectively<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.840> know<00:04:10.900> killing

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
strings and effectively you know killing

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
strings and effectively you know killing
the<00:04:11.470> notes<00:04:11.790> okay<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.299> what<00:04:13.450> happens<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.970> you're

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the notes okay so what happens is you're

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.729 
the notes okay so what happens is you're
gonna<00:04:16.090> practice<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.810> until<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.350> can<00:04:17.500> do<00:04:17.620> it

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
gonna practice it until you can do it

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.650 
gonna practice it until you can do it
like<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:18.039> nice<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.280> smooth<00:04:18.760> all<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.510> one

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
like that nice and smooth all in one

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.469 
like that nice and smooth all in one
motion<00:04:23.310> okay<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.370> that's<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.880> Chop<00:04:25.150> that's

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.219 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's
how<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.750> works

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
how it works

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.960 
how it works
so<00:04:26.620> when<00:04:26.800> we<00:04:26.919> put<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.250> into<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.580> strumming

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so when we put that into the strumming

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.830 
so when we put that into the strumming
pattern<00:04:28.000> we're<00:04:28.690> gonna<00:04:28.780> go<00:04:28.960> down

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:54.970 

chop<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.080> then<00:04:33.530> up<00:04:33.680> again<00:04:34.330> sound<00:04:35.330> like<00:04:35.480> this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.670 

okay<00:04:55.880> now<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.600> easier<00:04:56.990> said<00:04:57.260> than<00:04:57.410> done<00:04:57.470> I

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
okay now it's easier said than done I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.560 
okay now it's easier said than done I
expect<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.760> I'll<00:04:58.880> take<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.150> quite<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.390> bit<00:04:59.450> of

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.630 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of
time<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.990> practice<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.860> mean<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.340> know<00:05:01.400> it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
time to practice that I mean I know it

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.310 
time to practice that I mean I know it
takes<00:05:01.850> my<00:05:02.030> students<00:05:02.510> quite<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.720> while<00:05:03.020> before

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
takes my students quite a while before

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.840 
takes my students quite a while before
they<00:05:03.590> really<00:05:03.980> get<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.220> hang<00:05:04.400> of<00:05:04.520> it

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
they really get the hang of it

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.340 
they really get the hang of it
so<00:05:05.090> that's<00:05:05.270> brilliant<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:05.810> go<00:05:05.990> easy<00:05:06.020> on

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
so that's brilliant so go easy on

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.930 
so that's brilliant so go easy on
yourself<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:06.920> you<00:05:07.160> know<00:05:07.280> don't<00:05:07.550> don't<00:05:07.730> give
