00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
mityvac they'd have e-brake stop bled

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.179

them<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> old-fashioned<00:02:03.689> way<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.189> somebody

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
them the old-fashioned way with somebody

them the old-fashioned way with somebody
pushing<00:02:05.639> on<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.529> brake<00:02:07.529> pedal<00:02:07.829> than<00:02:08.190> me

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
pushing on the brake pedal than me

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
pushing on the brake pedal than me
working<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> bleeder<00:02:10.140> screw<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.950> getting

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
working the bleeder screw and getting

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.420 
working the bleeder screw and getting
all<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.490> air<00:02:11.610> out<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.480> worked<00:02:12.720> fine<00:02:13.019> so

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
all the air out then they worked fine so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.930 
all the air out then they worked fine so
another<00:02:14.430> old<00:02:14.640> trick<00:02:14.970> is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940

it's<00:02:55.550> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.790> go<00:02:55.880> up<00:02:56.060> through<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.510> brake

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it's going to go up through the brake

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.280 
it's going to go up through the brake
fluid<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.270> when<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.780> release<00:03:00.110> your

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
fluid and when it when you release your

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.380 
fluid and when it when you release your
pedal<00:03:00.740> it's<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:01.010> gonna<00:03:01.130> suck<00:03:01.460> fluid<00:03:01.910> back<00:03:02.120> in

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390

it's<00:03:02.540> not<00:03:02.660> gonna<00:03:02.840> be<00:03:02.930> sucking<00:03:03.320> air<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.810> that's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
it's not gonna be sucking air so that's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.220 
it's not gonna be sucking air so that's

from<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.610> brake<00:04:36.880> cylinder<00:04:37.480> no<00:04:38.080> laughs

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
from the brake cylinder no laughs

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.040 
from the brake cylinder no laughs
cylinder<00:04:39.010> through<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.610> will<00:04:40.390> cylinder<00:04:40.900> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
cylinder through that will cylinder and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.930 
cylinder through that will cylinder and
then<00:04:41.170> back<00:04:41.350> across<00:04:41.620> here<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:43.450> will<00:04:43.660> slowly

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
then back across here this will slowly

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.350 
then back across here this will slowly
and<00:04:45.940> it's<00:04:46.090> pushing<00:04:46.480> air<00:04:46.690> out<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:48.360> suppose

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
and it's pushing air out so I suppose

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.920 
and it's pushing air out so I suppose
you<00:04:49.630> could<00:04:49.870> leave<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.080> there<00:04:50.410> for<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.650> long<00:04:50.800> time

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
you could leave it there for a long time

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.100 
you could leave it there for a long time
and<00:04:52.930> we'll<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:53.770> something<00:04:54.220> done<00:04:54.400> but<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.930> I

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
and we'll get something done but if I

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.030 
and we'll get something done but if I
can<00:04:56.290> set<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.620> up<00:04:58.050> where<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.230> can<00:04:59.410> see<00:04:59.800> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
can set you up where you can see the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:51.510 
can set you up where you can see the
bubbles
