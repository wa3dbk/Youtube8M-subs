in<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.410> want<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.800> explain<00:00:02.190> the

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
in this video I want to explain the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.150 
in this video I want to explain the
different<00:00:02.760> types<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.179> genetic<00:00:03.689> engineering

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
different types of genetic engineering

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.590 
different types of genetic engineering
because<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.400> next<00:00:05.730> video<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.089> want<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> look

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
because in the next video I want to look

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080 
because in the next video I want to look
at<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.020> ethical<00:00:07.620> responses<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.580> these<00:00:08.730> types

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
at the ethical responses to these types

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
at the ethical responses to these types
of<00:00:09.300> genetic<00:00:09.750> engineering<00:00:10.230> well<00:00:11.160> let's<00:00:11.370> start

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of genetic engineering well let's start

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.390 
of genetic engineering well let's start
with<00:00:11.880> somatic<00:00:12.450> cell<00:00:12.929> gene<00:00:13.259> therapy<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
with somatic cell gene therapy this is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
with somatic cell gene therapy this is
probably<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.849> most<00:00:14.969> basic<00:00:15.599> form<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.990> genetic

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
probably the most basic form of genetic

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.590 
probably the most basic form of genetic
engineering<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.699> where<00:00:17.910> salads<00:00:18.420> are

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
engineering this is where salads are

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650 
engineering this is where salads are
modified<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.529> order<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.550> rectify<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:21.150> sort

is that the sort of long-term effects of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
is that the sort of long-term effects of
these<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:45.030> still<00:00:45.300> unknown<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.020> still<00:00:46.320> don't

such as down syndrome Huntington's
disease<00:01:02.780> haemophilia<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:05.250> basically

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
disease haemophilia so that's basically

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
disease haemophilia so that's basically
what<00:01:05.850> happens<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:06.900> more

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
what happens this is much more

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.130 
what happens this is much more
controversial<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.450> affecting

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
controversial because as it's affecting

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
controversial because as it's affecting
future<00:01:10.530> generations<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.610> mistake<00:01:12.170> could

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
future generations one mistake could

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
future generations one mistake could
lead<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:14.010> disaster<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:15.030> could<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
lead to a big disaster it could be

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
lead to a big disaster it could be
terrible<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
terrible so this is more we have to be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
terrible so this is more we have to be
more<00:01:18.000> careful<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.590> more

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
more careful about and it's more

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.660 
more careful about and it's more
controversial<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.159> said<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
controversial and then it has said that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
controversial and then it has said that
what<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.970> should<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.900> should<00:01:25.229> first

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
what we should do is we should first

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
what we should do is we should first
analyze<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> long-term<00:01:26.790> indirect<00:01:27.390> effects<00:01:27.720> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
analyze a long-term indirect effects of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
analyze a long-term indirect effects of
somatic<00:01:28.470> cell<00:01:28.710> gene<00:01:29.040> therapy<00:01:29.729> once<00:01:30.420> you've

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
somatic cell gene therapy once you've

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
somatic cell gene therapy once you've
done<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.900> test<00:01:31.470> germline<00:01:32.189> gene<00:01:32.610> therapy

done that test germline gene therapy

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.749 
done that test germline gene therapy
animals<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.740> once<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.340> public

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

animals and then once we have public
approval<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.509> well<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.439> should<00:01:37.500> use<00:01:37.890> on

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
approval as well then we should use on

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
approval as well then we should use on
humans<00:01:38.180> because<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.450> such<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> major<00:01:40.140> type

also a controversial statement to make
because<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.329> leads<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> things<00:01:57.930> like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
because it this leads to things like

IVF clinics and this has come about

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.410 
IVF clinics and this has come about
their<00:02:20.140> ninety<00:02:21.140> percent<00:02:21.260> oh<00:02:21.770> I'm<00:02:22.730> sorry<00:02:23.120> and

for<00:02:23.870> some<00:02:24.020> plus<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.470> babies<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.090> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
for some plus of babies and that I have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.720 
for some plus of babies and that I have
been<00:02:26.600> dropped<00:02:27.080> or<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.890> spare<00:02:28.130> embryos<00:02:28.490> are

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
been dropped or the spare embryos are

been dropped or the spare embryos are
female<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.360> sex<00:02:30.020> selection<00:02:30.380> has<00:02:30.560> led<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.069> a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
female and sex selection has led to a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.990 
female and sex selection has led to a
decrease<00:02:31.819> in<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.239> amount<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.800> females<00:02:34.000> born

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
decrease in that amount of females born

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.020 
decrease in that amount of females born
so<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:36.020> have<00:02:36.319> major<00:02:36.680> major<00:02:37.069> problems<00:02:37.730> like

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so it can have major major problems like

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.540 
so it can have major major problems like
because<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:38.780> unnatural<00:02:39.230> we<00:02:40.130> still<00:02:40.370> don't

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
because it's unnatural we still don't

because it's unnatural we still don't

know what's going on I think that

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.930 
know what's going on I think that

enhancement genetic engineering is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.479 
enhancement genetic engineering is
really<00:02:44.780> bad<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.110> mean<00:02:45.290> humans<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.250> they<00:02:46.430> were

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
really bad I mean humans if they were

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.580 
really bad I mean humans if they were
allowed<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.940> choose<00:02:47.360> their<00:02:47.390> children<00:02:48.050> they

was change this could be seen as another
form<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.790> Hitler<00:03:23.120> tried<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.480> do

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
form of like what the Hitler tried to do

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.780 
form of like what the Hitler tried to do
create<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.140> better<00:03:24.590> race<00:03:24.920> but<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.519> know<00:03:25.640> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
create is a better race but you know the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.150 
create is a better race but you know the
some<00:03:26.030> more<00:03:26.269> sophisticated<00:03:26.989> technology<00:03:27.860> and

some more sophisticated technology and
it<00:03:28.730> also<00:03:28.910> means<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.390> if<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.720> add

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
it also means that if you add

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.470 
it also means that if you add
disabilities<00:03:30.890> or<00:03:31.160> if<00:03:31.280> you're<00:03:31.489> not<00:03:32.060> perfect

you'll<00:03:33.019> be<00:03:33.140> discriminated<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.160> much<00:03:34.519> because

engineering<00:03:43.190> has<00:03:43.430> been<00:03:43.640> quite<00:03:44.090> useful<00:03:44.120> but

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
engineering has been quite useful but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.539 
engineering has been quite useful but
there<00:03:44.900> are<00:03:44.959> problems<00:03:45.109> associated<00:03:45.620> for

engineered<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.859> be<00:03:48.980> fatter<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.970> they

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
engineered to be fatter so that they

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.810 
engineered to be fatter so that they

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
produce more yield the legs break off

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.920 
produce more yield the legs break off
because<00:03:53.000> he<00:03:53.090> can't<00:03:53.299> cope<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.690> body

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.289 
because he can't cope with the body
weight<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.350> also<00:03:55.280> these<00:03:55.430> are<00:03:55.640> things<00:03:55.910> like<00:03:56.090> I

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
weight and also these are things like I

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.810 
weight and also these are things like I
think<00:03:56.630> there<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.200> chemical<00:03:57.890> within<00:03:58.459> milk

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
think there is a chemical within milk

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.210 
think there is a chemical within milk
which<00:03:59.480> basically<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.380> think<00:04:00.680> alpha<00:04:01.040> 1

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
which basically I think alpha 1

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.849 
which basically I think alpha 1
something<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.850> helps<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:02.690> cystic<00:04:03.079> fibrosis

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
something it helps with cystic fibrosis

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.490 
something it helps with cystic fibrosis
so<00:04:04.549> by<00:04:04.760> doing<00:04:05.150> animal<00:04:05.720> genetic<00:04:06.079> engineering

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
so by doing animal genetic engineering

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.710 
so by doing animal genetic engineering
we<00:04:06.650> can<00:04:06.769> produce<00:04:07.010> more<00:04:07.459> of<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.120> help<00:04:08.150> more

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
we can produce more of that to help more

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.500 
we can produce more of that to help more
with<00:04:08.870> cystic<00:04:09.230> fibrosis<00:04:09.950> there<00:04:10.880> are<00:04:11.090> long-term

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
with cystic fibrosis there are long-term

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.360 
with cystic fibrosis there are long-term
things<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.320> don't<00:04:12.530> know<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:12.890> animals

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
things that we don't know with animals

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.090 
things that we don't know with animals
and<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.820> could<00:04:14.060> lead<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.329> for<00:04:14.720> example

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
and it could lead to for example

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.590 
and it could lead to for example
diseases<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.250> animals<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:16.820> coming<00:04:17.450> to

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
diseases that animals have coming to

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.529 
diseases that animals have coming to
humans<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:18.950> example<00:04:19.039> and<00:04:19.700> pigs<00:04:20.090> are<00:04:20.329> bred

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
humans so for example and pigs are bred

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.839 
humans so for example and pigs are bred
to<00:04:20.659> do<00:04:20.900> loads<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.530> kind<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.830> jobs<00:04:22.190> for<00:04:22.310> humans

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
to do loads of kind of jobs for humans

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.610 
to do loads of kind of jobs for humans
we<00:04:23.419> could<00:04:23.630> maybe<00:04:23.840> get<00:04:24.080> pig<00:04:24.409> related<00:04:24.830> diseases

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
we could maybe get pig related diseases

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.040 
we could maybe get pig related diseases
and<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:26.460> possible<00:04:27.000> because<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.419> believed<00:04:27.840> to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
and this possible because is believed to

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.120 
and this possible because is believed to
be<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.229> aids<00:04:28.650> has<00:04:29.040> come<00:04:29.370> from<00:04:29.580> monkeys<00:04:30.150> so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
be that aids has come from monkeys so

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.969 
be that aids has come from monkeys so
quite<00:04:32.130> interesting<00:04:32.639> fact<00:04:32.880> actually<00:04:33.470> GM<00:04:34.470> crops

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
quite interesting fact actually GM crops

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.250 
quite interesting fact actually GM crops
is<00:04:35.250> among<00:04:35.490> crops<00:04:35.910> are<00:04:36.120> genetically<00:04:36.570> modified

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
is among crops are genetically modified

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.100 
is among crops are genetically modified
in<00:04:37.530> order<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.460> produce<00:04:38.760> more<00:04:38.940> yield<00:04:39.540> this

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
in order to produce more yield this

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.700 
in order to produce more yield this
could<00:04:40.470> basically<00:04:41.389> increase<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.720> inequality

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
could basically increase the inequality

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.409 
could basically increase the inequality
because<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> rich<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.669> afford<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
because the rich can afford it and the

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.230 
because the rich can afford it and the
poor<00:04:45.720> can't<00:04:46.080> say<00:04:46.440> just<00:04:46.590> keep<00:04:46.860> singing

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
poor can't say just keep singing

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240 
poor can't say just keep singing
progressively<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:48.960> then<00:04:49.680> again<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.190> could

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
progressively but then again it could

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.610 
progressively but then again it could
sort<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.180> cure<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.660> whole<00:04:51.840> world<00:04:52.199> hunger

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
sort of cure the whole world hunger

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.920 
sort of cure the whole world hunger
which<00:04:53.250> would<00:04:53.460> be<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:54.060> greatest<00:04:54.300> good<00:04:54.600> and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
which would be the greatest good and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.350 
which would be the greatest good and
that<00:04:55.260> would<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.710> know<00:04:55.919> an<00:04:56.639> amazing<00:04:57.150> thing

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
that would be you know an amazing thing

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.680 
that would be you know an amazing thing
to<00:04:57.389> do<00:04:58.340> cloning<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.850> a<00:04:59.880> big<00:05:00.120> problem<00:05:00.330> it

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
to do cloning I have a big problem it

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.150 
to do cloning I have a big problem it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.610 
but there's three types and we're
reproductive<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.030> therapeutic<00:05:03.720> Embree

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
reproductive and therapeutic Embree

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.770 
reproductive and therapeutic Embree
including<00:05:05.100> is<00:05:05.190> when<00:05:05.310> embryos<00:05:05.789> are<00:05:06.060> clothed<00:05:06.570> in

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
including is when embryos are clothed in

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.000 
including is when embryos are clothed in
order<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:08.010> get<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.340> stem<00:05:08.610> cells<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:10.010> conduct

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.070 
their puter clone or not therapeutic to
you<00:05:14.400> know<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:14.760> through<00:05:15.479> genetic<00:05:15.960> engineering

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
you know so through genetic engineering

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.969 
you know so through genetic engineering
and<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.889> produce<00:05:17.460> those<00:05:17.880> organs<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:18.990> stuff<00:05:19.229> so

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
and to produce those organs and stuff so

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.070 
and to produce those organs and stuff so
that's<00:05:20.100> embryo<00:05:20.580> learning<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.330> sometimes

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
that's embryo learning and sometimes

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.320 
that's embryo learning and sometimes
it's<00:05:22.289> also<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.220> could<00:05:23.430> have<00:05:23.580> to

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
it's also you so that you could have to

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.260 
it's also you so that you could have to
the<00:05:24.570> same<00:05:24.810> children<00:05:25.139> or<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.830> know<00:05:25.979> have<00:05:26.460> one
