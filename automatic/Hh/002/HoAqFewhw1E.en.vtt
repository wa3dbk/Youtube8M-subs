heated that up and I pushed the sides

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.720 
heated that up and I pushed the sides
upward<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:52.980> it<00:01:53.100> makes<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.370> funnel

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
upward so you can see it makes a funnel

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.670 
upward so you can see it makes a funnel
effect<00:01:54.150> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.480> inside<00:01:54.930> let<00:01:55.380> me<00:01:55.440> show<00:01:55.620> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
effect on the inside let me show you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240 
effect on the inside let me show you
down<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> center<00:01:57.350> all<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.380> way<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:59.220> how

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
down in the center all the way see how

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.820 
down in the center all the way see how
it's<00:01:59.490> made<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> funnel<00:02:00.180> effect<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:01.650> now<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
it's made a funnel effect so now that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's made a funnel effect so now that
the<00:02:02.250> dirt<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.970> won't<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.480> run<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.020> straight

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the dirt it won't just run it straight

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.170 
the dirt it won't just run it straight
through<00:02:04.620> you'll<00:02:05.220> actually<00:02:05.400> have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> place

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
through you'll actually have a place

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
through you'll actually have a place
that<00:02:06.420> will<00:02:06.510> mount<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.960> around<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:08.190> roots<00:02:08.460> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
that will mount up around the roots of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.980 
that will mount up around the roots of
the<00:02:08.729> plant<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> roots<00:02:09.510> will<00:02:09.690> actually

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
the plant now the roots will actually

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.310 
the plant now the roots will actually
grow<00:02:10.170> upward<00:02:11.540> I'll<00:02:12.540> show<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.810> how<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.050> works

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
grow upward I'll show you how that works

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.650 
grow upward I'll show you how that works
so<00:02:13.590> dimension<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> plants<00:02:14.459> hanging<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so dimension the plants hanging down the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
so dimension the plants hanging down the
roots<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.260> actually<00:02:16.530> grow<00:02:16.709> upwards<00:02:17.130> towards

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
roots will actually grow upwards towards

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.850 
roots will actually grow upwards towards
the<00:02:17.580> top<00:02:17.850> opposite<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:18.930> we're<00:02:19.080> used<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the top opposite what we're used to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.610 
the top opposite what we're used to
seeing<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.459> roots<00:02:20.640> growing<00:02:20.910> down<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
seeing with the roots growing down and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.949 
seeing with the roots growing down and
it's<00:02:22.620> not<00:02:22.860> more<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.190> novelty<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:24.660> some

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it's not more of a novelty for some

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780 
it's not more of a novelty for some
people<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.130> very

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
people but for me it's actually very

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.140 
people but for me it's actually very
handy<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.020> huge<00:02:28.440> deck<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.150> I've

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
handy because I got a huge deck and I've

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.120 
handy because I got a huge deck and I've
got<00:02:30.330> all<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.660> hanging<00:02:30.959> room<00:02:31.350> underneath<00:02:31.770> my

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
got all this hanging room underneath my

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.210 
got all this hanging room underneath my
deck<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:32.850> plants<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.560> love<00:02:34.800> tomatoes

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
deck to put plants and I love tomatoes

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.300 
deck to put plants and I love tomatoes
and<00:02:35.490> peppers<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.720> make<00:02:37.290> salsa<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.950> make<00:02:38.130> all

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and peppers I make salsa I make all

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550 
and peppers I make salsa I make all
kinds<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.640> sauces<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.209> stuff<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.290> with

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
kinds of sauces and stuff so with

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.229 
kinds of sauces and stuff so with
tomatoes<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.130> peppers<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:42.090> grow

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
tomatoes and peppers if I just grow

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.170 
tomatoes and peppers if I just grow
those<00:02:42.450> all<00:02:42.600> season<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.940> can't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
those all season and I really just can't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.030 
those all season and I really just can't
have<00:02:45.330> enough<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.720> those<00:02:45.840> things<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.410> eat

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
have enough of those things I just eat

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.090 
have enough of those things I just eat
them<00:02:47.190> all<00:02:47.310> summer<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.500> how<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.920> do

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
them all summer and so this is how I do

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.720 
them all summer and so this is how I do
it<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.610> by<00:02:50.760> hanging<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.209> these<00:02:51.360> plants<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
it just by hanging up these plants and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.910 
it just by hanging up these plants and
maximizing<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> room<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:55.500> nobody<00:02:55.650> ever

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
maximizing the room that nobody ever

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.470 
maximizing the room that nobody ever
goes<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.430> anyways<00:02:56.790> that's<00:02:57.060> why<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.450> my

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
goes to anyways that's why I have my

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.449 
goes to anyways that's why I have my
composter<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.500> watch<00:02:58.680> my<00:02:58.890> other<00:02:58.920> videos

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
composter if you watch my other videos

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.729 
composter if you watch my other videos
for<00:02:59.489> my<00:02:59.790> black<00:03:00.120> soldier<00:03:00.540> fly<00:03:00.720> larvae<00:03:01.170> it's

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
for my black soldier fly larvae it's

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.720 
for my black soldier fly larvae it's
under<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> deck<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.810> know<00:03:03.900> relatively

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
under the deck it's you know relatively

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.009 
under the deck it's you know relatively
it<00:03:05.730> gets<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> lot<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> Sun<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> south

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
it gets a lot of Sun it's on the south

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.160 
it gets a lot of Sun it's on the south
side<00:03:07.320> it's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.910> relatively<00:03:08.910> wind<00:03:09.209> less<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:09.959> that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
side it's a relatively wind less on that

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.009 
side it's a relatively wind less on that
part<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.880> get<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> lot<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.330> wind<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.750> but

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
part we do get a lot of wind here but

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.990 
part we do get a lot of wind here but
see<00:03:13.590> how<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.160> south<00:03:14.370> side<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:14.850> not

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
see how it's on the south side it's not

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.240 
see how it's on the south side it's not
directly<00:03:15.390> facing<00:03:15.900> west<00:03:16.140> where<00:03:16.470> most<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.100> our

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
directly facing west where most of our

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.330 
directly facing west where most of our
wind<00:03:17.459> comes<00:03:17.700> from<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.160> said

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
wind comes from and it's like I said

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.160 
wind comes from and it's like I said
plenty<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.790> Sun<00:03:20.970> out<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.989> just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
plenty of Sun out there and it's just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.810 
plenty of Sun out there and it's just
wasted<00:03:22.620> space<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.100> that's<00:03:23.280> why<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> hang<00:03:23.700> it

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
wasted space so that's why I hang it

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.180 
wasted space so that's why I hang it
under<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> deck

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
under the deck

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.770 
under the deck
and<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.970> after<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.720> make<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:28.480> after<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> push

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and so after I make that after I push

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.960 
and so after I make that after I push
this<00:03:30.050> part<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.740> can<00:03:30.920> see<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.130> also<00:03:31.400> melt<00:03:31.820> the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
this part in you can see I also melt the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.910 
this part in you can see I also melt the
handle<00:03:32.330> down<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.510> little<00:03:32.900> bit<00:03:33.050> too<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.800> it

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
handle down a little bit too so that it

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.520 
handle down a little bit too so that it
fits<00:03:34.160> flat<00:03:34.460> kind<00:03:35.210> of<00:03:35.330> my<00:03:35.420> test<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.990> will<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.320> fit

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
fits flat kind of my test is will it fit

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.040 
fits flat kind of my test is will it fit
flat<00:03:36.830> on<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.130> surface<00:03:37.580> like<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.090> how

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
flat on the surface like this and how

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.600 
flat on the surface like this and how
kind<00:03:39.380> of<00:03:39.500> level<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.100> since<00:03:40.280> it's<00:03:40.430> hanging

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
kind of level is it since it's hanging

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.490 
kind of level is it since it's hanging
up<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:41.090> care<00:03:41.360> if<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.600> super<00:03:41.810> level<00:03:42.290> but

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
up we don't care if it's super level but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.430 
up we don't care if it's super level but
just<00:03:43.310> for<00:03:43.570> purposes<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.630> cutting<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.170> part

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
just for purposes of cutting this part

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.410 
just for purposes of cutting this part
out<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.800> like<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.190> kind<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:46.880> keep<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.180> part

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
out I like to kind of keep the part

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.330 
out I like to kind of keep the part
bottom<00:03:47.810> part<00:03:48.020> flat<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:48.710> it's<00:03:48.830> easier<00:03:49.130> for<00:03:49.190> me

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
bottom part flat so it's easier for me

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.820 
bottom part flat so it's easier for me
to<00:03:49.430> work<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> top<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:51.320> next<00:03:51.470> thing<00:03:51.710> I

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
to work on the top the next thing I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.560 
to work on the top the next thing I
would<00:03:51.980> do<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:53.120> imagine<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:56.510> is

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
would do I do is imagine that this is

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.750 
would do I do is imagine that this is
not<00:03:56.930> cut<00:03:57.260> yet<00:03:57.530> what<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:57.950> would<00:03:58.130> do<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.400> what<00:03:58.730> I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
not cut yet what I would do is what I

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.830 
not cut yet what I would do is what I
did<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.210> just<00:03:59.540> traced<00:04:00.260> around<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.920> little

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
did is just traced around a little

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.160 
did is just traced around a little
section<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:05.060> traced<00:04:05.450> out<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.840> bottom

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
section I just traced out the bottom

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.150 
section I just traced out the bottom
part<00:04:06.410> hopefully<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:07.100> will<00:04:07.190> hold<00:04:07.400> up<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:09.160> just

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
part hopefully that will hold up so just

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.740 
part hopefully that will hold up so just
imagine<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.640> was<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.000> piece<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.390> came<00:04:11.540> out

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
imagine this was the piece that came out

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.220 
imagine this was the piece that came out
of<00:04:11.780> here<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:13.970> did<00:04:14.240> is<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:14.540> traced<00:04:14.960> it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
of here what I did is I just traced it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.780 
of here what I did is I just traced it
around<00:04:15.440> with<00:04:15.620> my<00:04:15.770> black<00:04:15.950> sharpie<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.520> I<00:04:16.609> did

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
around with my black sharpie and I did

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.490 
around with my black sharpie and I did
it<00:04:16.910> by<00:04:17.030> hand<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.420> don't<00:04:17.480> I'm<00:04:18.049> not<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.380> don't

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
it by hand I don't I'm not you don't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.800 
it by hand I don't I'm not you don't
have<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.709> be<00:04:18.799> really<00:04:19.040> fancy<00:04:19.489> with<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.810> just

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
have to be really fancy with this just

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.510 
have to be really fancy with this just
trace<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.109> around<00:04:21.470> by<00:04:21.650> hand<00:04:21.920> make<00:04:22.220> sure<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
trace it around by hand make sure that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.430 
trace it around by hand make sure that
you<00:04:22.640> leave<00:04:22.820> room<00:04:23.030> for<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.300> tabs<00:04:23.600> you<00:04:23.960> can<00:04:24.140> see

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
you leave room for the tabs you can see

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.070 
you leave room for the tabs you can see
that<00:04:24.650> these<00:04:25.490> tabs<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:26.030> didn't<00:04:26.270> cut<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.600> straight

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
that these tabs I didn't cut it straight

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.869 
that these tabs I didn't cut it straight
around<00:04:27.590> here<00:04:27.920> I<00:04:28.040> cut<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:30.680> this

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
around here I cut it like this

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.239 
around here I cut it like this
so<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.569> have<00:04:33.809> little<00:04:34.020> ears<00:04:34.379> that<00:04:34.860> hang<00:04:35.039> off<00:04:35.189> of

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 
so I have little ears that hang off of

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:37.249 
so I have little ears that hang off of
each<00:04:35.550> side<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.179> what<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.539> do<00:04:36.629> with<00:04:36.869> the<00:04:36.990> ears

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
each side and what I do with the ears

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.859 
each side and what I do with the ears
then<00:04:37.610> after<00:04:38.610> I've<00:04:38.699> cut<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:39.119> bottom<00:04:39.449> piece<00:04:39.659> out

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:39.869 
then after I've cut the bottom piece out

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:43.399 
then after I've cut the bottom piece out
then<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.139> take<00:04:40.439> my<00:04:40.490> heat<00:04:41.490> gun<00:04:41.520> once<00:04:42.029> again<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.659> I

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
then I take my heat gun once again and I

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.219 
then I take my heat gun once again and I
melt<00:04:43.649> these<00:04:43.889> tabs<00:04:44.520> upward<00:04:45.240> these<00:04:45.629> dog<00:04:45.929> ears

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
melt these tabs upward these dog ears

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.489 
melt these tabs upward these dog ears
are<00:04:46.469> melted<00:04:47.129> upwards<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.909> now<00:04:48.349> when<00:04:49.349> you're

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:49.499 
are melted upwards and now when you're

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.019 
are melted upwards and now when you're
doing<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.009> when<00:04:50.339> you're<00:04:50.459> using<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.849> heat

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 
doing this when you're using the heat

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:52.549 
doing this when you're using the heat
gun<00:04:51.209> make<00:04:51.509> sure<00:04:51.659> you<00:04:51.869> use<00:04:52.080> your<00:04:52.110> gloves

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:52.559 
gun make sure you use your gloves

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.459 
gun make sure you use your gloves
because<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.219> does<00:04:53.399> get<00:04:53.639> really<00:04:53.759> hot<00:04:54.089> and

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
because it does get really hot and

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.540 
because it does get really hot and
sometimes<00:04:55.469> even<00:04:55.649> with<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.979> gloves<00:04:56.249> on<00:04:56.369> it's

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
sometimes even with the gloves on it's

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.850 
sometimes even with the gloves on it's
pretty<00:04:56.759> warm<00:04:57.119> so<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:57.719> a<00:04:57.959> lot<00:04:58.259> easier<00:04:58.439> to<00:04:58.619> work

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
pretty warm so it's a lot easier to work

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.359 
pretty warm so it's a lot easier to work
with<00:04:59.069> them<00:04:59.279> with<00:04:59.429> gloves<00:04:59.819> on<00:05:00.029> and<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.800> last

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:02.369 
with them with gloves on and the last

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.969 
with them with gloves on and the last
step<00:05:02.699> before<00:05:03.059> I<00:05:03.300> put<00:05:03.899> the<00:05:04.020> twine<00:05:04.289> together<00:05:04.679> is

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
step before I put the twine together is

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.439 
step before I put the twine together is
I<00:05:05.939> take<00:05:06.929> a<00:05:07.199> metal<00:05:07.789> screw<00:05:10.939> just<00:05:11.939> take<00:05:12.089> a<00:05:12.119> regular

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
I take a metal screw just take a regular

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.559 
I take a metal screw just take a regular
guy<00:05:13.439> this<00:05:13.499> one's<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.889> deck<00:05:14.129> screw<00:05:14.459> just<00:05:15.300> take<00:05:15.539> a

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
guy this one's a deck screw just take a

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.339 
guy this one's a deck screw just take a
screw<00:05:15.990> heat<00:05:16.529> it<00:05:16.679> up<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:16.979> your<00:05:17.129> heat<00:05:17.369> gun<00:05:18.349> make

don't measure anything out this is all
done<00:05:33.899> by<00:05:33.929> hand<00:05:34.110> because<00:05:34.709> when<00:05:35.669> you're<00:05:35.789> hanging

done by hand because when you're hanging

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:39.079 
done by hand because when you're hanging
it<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:37.319> twine<00:05:37.589> actually<00:05:38.069> kind<00:05:38.459> of<00:05:38.550> levels<00:05:38.909> its

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
it the twine actually kind of levels its

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.339 
it the twine actually kind of levels its
itself<00:05:39.839> out<00:05:40.079> the<00:05:40.979> last<00:05:41.189> step<00:05:41.459> is<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.819> take

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
itself out the last step is I take

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.189 
itself out the last step is I take
approximately<00:05:43.349> I<00:05:43.649> want<00:05:44.550> to<00:05:44.639> say<00:05:44.789> it's<00:05:44.939> about

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
approximately I want to say it's about

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.129 
approximately I want to say it's about
12<00:05:46.199> feet<00:05:46.529> of<00:05:46.589> string<00:05:47.519> and<00:05:47.789> you<00:05:48.689> can<00:05:48.839> adjust

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
12 feet of string and you can adjust

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.799 
12 feet of string and you can adjust
that<00:05:49.229> size<00:05:49.589> to<00:05:49.829> what<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.069> need<00:05:50.249> and<00:05:51.089> I<00:05:51.689> just

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:51.809 
that size to what you need and I just

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:55.279 
that size to what you need and I just
tie<00:05:52.229> it<00:05:52.289> up<00:05:52.529> I<00:05:52.709> put<00:05:53.099> I<00:05:53.569> just<00:05:54.569> take<00:05:54.869> one<00:05:54.899> long

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
tie it up I put I just take one long

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.170 
tie it up I put I just take one long
piece<00:05:55.559> and<00:05:55.829> I<00:05:55.889> thread<00:05:56.189> it<00:05:56.339> through<00:05:56.519> each<00:05:56.879> of

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
piece and I thread it through each of

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.719 
piece and I thread it through each of
these<00:05:57.269> holes<00:05:57.769> that<00:05:58.769> leaves<00:05:59.039> me<00:05:59.189> one<00:05:59.459> long

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
these holes that leaves me one long

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.299 
these holes that leaves me one long
piece<00:06:00.059> that<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:00.419> bring<00:06:00.689> out<00:06:00.809> to<00:06:01.079> the<00:06:01.110> end<00:06:01.349> then<00:06:02.219> I

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:02.309 
piece that I bring out to the end then I

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.730 
piece that I bring out to the end then I
tie<00:06:02.550> off<00:06:02.759> the<00:06:02.969> end<00:06:03.119> see<00:06:04.019> if<00:06:04.139> I<00:06:04.199> can<00:06:04.379> find<00:06:04.559> it

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
tie off the end see if I can find it

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.089 
tie off the end see if I can find it
like<00:06:04.919> this<00:06:06.499> it's<00:06:07.499> hard<00:06:07.679> to<00:06:07.800> do<00:06:07.949> this

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
like this it's hard to do this

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.999 
like this it's hard to do this
one-handed<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:10.050> then<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.289> tie<00:06:10.499> it<00:06:10.529> off<00:06:10.769> like

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
one-handed so then I tie it off like

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.999 
one-handed so then I tie it off like
this<00:06:11.039> at<00:06:11.429> the<00:06:11.550> end<00:06:11.579> it's<00:06:11.849> a<00:06:11.939> simple<00:06:12.329> regular

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
this at the end it's a simple regular

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.129 
this at the end it's a simple regular
knot

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
knot

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.339 
knot
it's<00:06:16.139> not<00:06:16.289> a<00:06:16.319> fancy<00:06:18.020> Slipknot<00:06:19.020> or<00:06:19.199> anything

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
it's not a fancy Slipknot or anything

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.020 
it's not a fancy Slipknot or anything
like<00:06:19.650> that<00:06:19.680> it's<00:06:19.979> just<00:06:20.129> a<00:06:20.219> regular<00:06:20.669> old<00:06:20.819> night

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
like that it's just a regular old night

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.659 
like that it's just a regular old night
and<00:06:21.300> then<00:06:22.139> I<00:06:22.259> take<00:06:22.500> each<00:06:22.680> of<00:06:22.860> these<00:06:22.949> sections

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
and then I take each of these sections

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.050 
and then I take each of these sections
here<00:06:23.969> and<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.270> pull<00:06:24.509> them<00:06:24.719> upward<00:06:25.699> of<00:06:26.699> course<00:06:26.909> I

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
here and I pull them upward of course I

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.240 
here and I pull them upward of course I
don't<00:06:27.150> have<00:06:27.270> my<00:06:27.539> other<00:06:28.259> hand<00:06:28.590> available<00:06:29.099> to

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
don't have my other hand available to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.619 
don't have my other hand available to
hold<00:06:29.430> it<00:06:29.580> down<00:06:29.699> but<00:06:30.000> I<00:06:30.030> would<00:06:30.240> pull<00:06:30.479> these

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
hold it down but I would pull these

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.510 
hold it down but I would pull these
upwards<00:06:31.229> and<00:06:31.530> make<00:06:32.490> it<00:06:32.639> self<00:06:32.909> centered<00:06:34.520> you

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
upwards and make it self centered you

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.249 
upwards and make it self centered you
know<00:06:35.550> self<00:06:35.909> centered<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:36.509> that<00:06:36.539> when<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:36.990> pick

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
know self centered so that when I pick

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.240 
know self centered so that when I pick
up<00:06:37.439> on<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.710> entire<00:06:37.979> unit<00:06:39.080> everything's<00:06:40.250> nice

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
up on the entire unit everything's nice

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.950 
up on the entire unit everything's nice
and<00:06:41.490> tight<00:06:41.669> these<00:06:42.060> hang<00:06:42.240> up<00:06:42.389> underneath<00:06:42.810> the

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
and tight these hang up underneath the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.610 
and tight these hang up underneath the
deck<00:06:43.310> like<00:06:44.310> I<00:06:44.430> said<00:06:44.669> and<00:06:45.210> it's<00:06:46.050> pretty<00:06:46.319> self

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
deck like I said and it's pretty self

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.499 
deck like I said and it's pretty self
level<00:06:47.039> now<00:06:47.159> there's<00:06:47.490> a<00:06:47.550> lot<00:06:47.639> of<00:06:47.789> extra<00:06:48.240> there

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
level now there's a lot of extra there

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.029 
level now there's a lot of extra there
because<00:06:48.840> I<00:06:48.900> didn't<00:06:49.139> grab<00:06:49.379> the<00:06:49.409> last<00:06:49.710> string

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
because I didn't grab the last string

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.369 
because I didn't grab the last string
but<00:06:50.909> hopefully<00:06:51.509> you<00:06:51.599> get<00:06:51.689> the<00:06:51.750> idea

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
but hopefully you get the idea

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.230 
but hopefully you get the idea
I<00:06:52.409> do<00:06:52.529> have<00:06:52.860> pictures<00:06:53.069> of<00:06:53.279> this<00:06:53.520> also<00:06:53.969> if<00:06:54.090> you

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
thing about this when you put your plant

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.360 
thing about this when you put your plant
in<00:07:02.150> what<00:07:03.150> you<00:07:03.300> do<00:07:03.449> is<00:07:03.659> you<00:07:03.840> thread<00:07:04.199> take<00:07:05.189> the

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
in what you do is you thread take the

in what you do is you thread take the
dirt<00:07:05.580> out<00:07:05.759> and<00:07:06.000> you<00:07:06.330> just<00:07:06.509> have<00:07:06.659> little<00:07:06.960> root

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
dirt out and you just have little root

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.700 
dirt out and you just have little root
structure<00:07:07.650> and<00:07:08.360> the<00:07:09.360> stem<00:07:09.599> and<00:07:09.779> you<00:07:09.840> stick<00:07:10.529> it

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
structure and the stem and you stick it

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.760 
structure and the stem and you stick it
through<00:07:10.740> here<00:07:11.430> and<00:07:12.020> what<00:07:13.020> I<00:07:13.050> do<00:07:13.169> is<00:07:13.379> I<00:07:13.469> put<00:07:13.650> my

finger through the there holding the
stem<00:07:15.719> and<00:07:15.990> I<00:07:16.289> fill<00:07:16.529> the<00:07:16.650> bottom<00:07:16.979> part<00:07:17.189> up<00:07:17.370> with

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
stem and I fill the bottom part up with

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.110 
stem and I fill the bottom part up with
dirt<00:07:17.849> and<00:07:18.259> then<00:07:19.259> at<00:07:19.560> the<00:07:20.250> very<00:07:20.279> end<00:07:20.669> if<00:07:20.969> you'd

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
dirt and then at the very end if you'd

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.200 
dirt and then at the very end if you'd
like<00:07:21.330> if<00:07:21.719> you<00:07:21.900> have<00:07:22.050> some<00:07:22.289> shallow<00:07:22.800> roots<00:07:23.250> like

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
like if you have some shallow roots like

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.079 
like if you have some shallow roots like
herbs<00:07:24.539> you<00:07:24.930> can<00:07:24.960> actually<00:07:25.259> grow<00:07:25.860> herbs<00:07:26.430> upward

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:27.089 
herbs you can actually grow herbs upward

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.019 
herbs you can actually grow herbs upward
so<00:07:27.779> they<00:07:28.020> you<00:07:28.680> can<00:07:28.830> have<00:07:28.979> the<00:07:29.190> tomatoes<00:07:29.639> or<00:07:29.879> the

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:30.029 
so they you can have the tomatoes or the

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:34.100 
so they you can have the tomatoes or the
peppers<00:07:30.479> aim<00:07:30.930> downward<00:07:31.940> and<00:07:32.940> herbs<00:07:33.659> or

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
peppers aim downward and herbs or

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.129 
peppers aim downward and herbs or
shallow<00:07:34.770> roots<00:07:35.449> plants<00:07:36.449> growing<00:07:36.659> upwards

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 
shallow roots plants growing upwards

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.209 
shallow roots plants growing upwards
from<00:07:37.289> there<00:07:37.440> so<00:07:37.560> you<00:07:37.650> actually<00:07:37.770> have<00:07:38.039> two

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219 
from there so you actually have two

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.909 
from there so you actually have two
plants<00:07:38.520> in<00:07:38.699> there<00:07:38.819> if<00:07:38.909> you<00:07:39.000> prefer<00:07:39.360> I<00:07:39.770> did<00:07:40.770> not

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
plants in there if you prefer I did not

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:45.079 
plants in there if you prefer I did not
do<00:07:41.159> that<00:07:41.190> this<00:07:41.909> particular<00:07:42.710> season<00:07:43.969> but<00:07:44.969> it

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:45.089 
do that this particular season but it

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.390 
do that this particular season but it
could<00:07:45.270> be<00:07:45.419> done<00:07:45.629> because<00:07:46.110> the<00:07:46.319> roots<00:07:46.529> you<00:07:46.800> know

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 
could be done because the roots you know

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.879 
could be done because the roots you know
the<00:07:47.610> roots<00:07:47.789> will<00:07:48.139> impact<00:07:49.139> inside<00:07:49.560> of<00:07:49.740> here

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:49.889 
the roots will impact inside of here

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:51.850 
the roots will impact inside of here
from<00:07:50.009> the<00:07:50.069> tomato<00:07:50.460> or<00:07:50.550> the<00:07:50.759> pepper<00:07:50.969> plant<00:07:51.389> and

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860 
from the tomato or the pepper plant and

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.290 
from the tomato or the pepper plant and
they'll<00:07:52.860> work<00:07:53.370> just<00:07:53.610> fine<00:07:53.789> with<00:07:54.000> the<00:07:54.029> herbs

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 
they'll work just fine with the herbs

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.959 
they'll work just fine with the herbs
that<00:07:54.479> are<00:07:54.629> very<00:07:54.870> short<00:07:55.169> rooted<00:07:55.500> anyways<00:07:55.969> okay

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:56.969 
that are very short rooted anyways okay

00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:58.550 
that are very short rooted anyways okay
so<00:07:57.029> that's<00:07:57.449> it<00:07:57.659> for<00:07:57.689> now<00:07:57.900> this<00:07:58.199> is<00:07:58.349> Scott

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
so that's it for now this is Scott

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.159 
so that's it for now this is Scott
