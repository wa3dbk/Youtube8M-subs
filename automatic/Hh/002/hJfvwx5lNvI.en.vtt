00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
rebound cycle again and again I mean as

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199 
rebound cycle again and again I mean as
you've<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.470> seen<00:03:37.859> when<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.459> drastically

you've just seen when you drastically

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.970 
you've just seen when you drastically
change<00:03:39.480> your<00:03:39.690> diet<00:03:39.900> you'll<00:03:40.440> make<00:03:40.650> fast

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
change your diet you'll make fast

change your diet you'll make fast
changes<00:03:41.579> in<00:03:41.730> body<00:03:41.940> composition<00:03:42.480> during<00:03:43.140> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
changes in body composition during the

first couple weeks after that your gains

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.440 
first couple weeks after that your gains
start<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.170> plateau<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.799> mean<00:03:47.700> our<00:03:47.880> body<00:03:48.180> is

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
start to plateau I mean our body is

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.479 
start to plateau I mean our body is
built<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:48.989> survival<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.070> can<00:03:50.250> quickly

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
built for survival so we can quickly

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.780 
built for survival so we can quickly
adapt<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.180> change<00:03:51.829> those<00:03:52.829> rapid<00:03:53.340> gains<00:03:53.549> that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
adapt to change those rapid gains that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.160 
adapt to change those rapid gains that
you're<00:03:53.910> making<00:03:54.060> whenever<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.750> switch<00:03:54.900> up

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
you're making whenever you switch up

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.770 
you're making whenever you switch up
your<00:03:55.290> diet<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.799> your<00:03:56.430> body<00:03:56.700> adapting<00:03:57.600> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
your diet is your body adapting and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.039 
your diet is your body adapting and
growing<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.380> response<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.100> changes<00:03:59.579> made

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
so how do we keep on making consistent
