this one's for 32-bit 32 bits way easier

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.180 
this one's for 32-bit 32 bits way easier
to<00:01:57.880> use<00:01:58.210> them<00:01:58.480> to<00:01:58.630> 64<00:01:59.230> bit<00:01:59.409> so<00:02:00.310> copy<00:02:01.030> paste<00:02:02.190> it's

yeah let's just use a 64-bit
add<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> steps<00:02:23.470> for<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.770> 64<00:02:24.280> bit<00:02:24.570> so

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
add to do the steps for the 64 bit so

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.410 
add to do the steps for the 64 bit so
these<00:02:25.990> are<00:02:26.050> both<00:02:26.290> direct<00:02:26.710> downloads
