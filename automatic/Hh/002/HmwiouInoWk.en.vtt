 today the path of gold and path 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.730
 only when passing by goats and alone 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.700
 local breeders are able 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 to find these ancient galleries a

 capo marrargiu very harsh territory 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.059
 they are now almost completely covered 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.039
 from vegetation to hide precisely 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.039
 a story for unity 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 but remains 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.420
 after a few hours of walking and having 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 passed passages exposed on rock 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 also with the help of strings of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 security prudently equipped by

 carmelo an entrance carved into the rock 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.930
 on a tiny terrace a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.320
 overlooking the sea it signals on arrival 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 to the mine 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.079
 along the navigation the bosana coast 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.149
 reveals all its wild beauty and 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.950
 its origins of volcanic nature to which 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.950
 we owe the many mineral riches 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.149
 barbara still doesn't know that vincenzo la 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.130
 is leading to live one of the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.890
 most incredible adventures of his life 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.659
 an unimaginable speleological journey 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.070
 to discover the most secluded places 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.990
 almost like the path of gold 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000
 boys commandos on the narco awards 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.929
 using small canes for 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.929
 carry the equipment 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 Carmelo climbs first to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 place fixed ropes that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.950
 allow everyone to get in 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 security with the help of handles 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.850
 self-locking 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.880
 an impressive cascade of calcite 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
 white drops over 30 meters from the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.950
 top of the cave leaving 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.930
 literally breathless 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.080
 and this is the maximum level of the drug 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.970
 over equal as clearly makes us 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.810
 remit is more able to contain the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.810
 equality 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.689
 no 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.250
 but despite the excitement of the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 discover the desire to dive 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.940
 finally in the water for exploration 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.370
 underwater submerged branch leaves alone 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.540
 time to regain the dinghy 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.310
 wear diving equipment e 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:16.040
 sink back into the cave of gods 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:18.200
 pelicans the cavity is very narrow and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.000
 elongated enough to remember one more 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 slit than a cave proper 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.550
 but its being so cramped to yield 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 if possible even more fascinating 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.730
 and then finally barbarous in his 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.290
 element that can let you go 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 exploring the caves 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.130
 submarines of a good initial purpose of the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.260
 his journey after a few meters the light that 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.000
 arrives from the outside disappears completely and 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.200
 we must completely rely on 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.200
 underwater illuminators 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.330
 the bottom is covered with the remains of 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.040
 dead leaves of Posidonia oceanica 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.210
 ready to stand up to the mini movement 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.580
 of water at about half the length 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.900
 of the barbarian cave carmel re-emerge 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 to admire them once 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.160
 vincenzo carmelo and barbarian of earn 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.160
 the exit 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.319
 the imposing mine that if not successful 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.240
 he knew all of them in detail 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.289
 burrows would be almost inevitable 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.289
 lose the way back 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.320
 affection 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.320
 We reached 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.650
 an almost unexplored area of ​​this 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.300
 mine through this tunnel 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.300
 really quite difficult 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.969
 near the ancient settlement 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.740
 Argentine tower mining were 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.560
 found the foundations of several 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.729
 pre Roman artifacts probably indeed 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.729
 almost with certainty 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.889
 these are structures used for the 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:54.069
 fusion of the metals, that is, of the ancient 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:59.259
 furnaces probably already dating back to 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:02.349
 Nuragic period around 1500 1800 years 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.569
 before christ by vincenzo 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.129
 they represent the testimony 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:10.349
 of the high mining value of the area 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:14.379
 from prehistoric times what you see 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:16.750
 only the oven base which 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.449
 was like saying realized under the 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.050
 ground in this case in the rock 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:25.479
 this pica dips to the archaeological site is 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.729
 really the last excursion and on 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.199
 adventures of barbara bosa drops a 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.199
 sunset of the color of gold
