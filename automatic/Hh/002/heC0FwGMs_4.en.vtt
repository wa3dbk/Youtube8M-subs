00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 you already have to share japan with you 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 and they are children there is projected tension I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 you only hear you and come and share a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 little waiting for the arrival of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 spring and the cold is a thing of the past 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.400
 And there is not much left to appreciate the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 beautiful cherry blossoms out there to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 end of March or beginning of April 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
 depending on where you live in japan is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 when you start to see the sakura and the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 April in Japanese as the year 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.570
 new 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.970
 for many since it is the new school year 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.250
 the new graduates begin their 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.380
 new jobs and so on at school 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.780
 where I teach classes at this time 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.790
 are preparing for the recordings in 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.760
 this month of March and many good 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.040
 students are taking tests to 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.500
 enter the new schools or 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.720
 graduating if you're thinking about going to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.239
 study to japan probably move 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.910
 in March to be ready and start 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.650
 classes there in April some have 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.830
 asked what is the best 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.009
 season to come to japan to work 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.630
 or find work in this aspect if 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.729
 I could comment from my own experience 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.280
 since early January is when 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.640
 Many companies start hiring 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.250
 people to work and from January 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.020
 I think it's the best season to be in 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.070
 Japan looking for work sending 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.290
 applications because it's when 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.810
 you will find more opportunities to 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.590
 work compared to other dates of the year 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.930
 in fact already for the month of March the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.460
 most of the positions are taken and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.150
 the labor examinations become 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.910
 plus 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.290
 houses videos about work that you have to 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.840
 study to find work and so on 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.300
 I have already done those who take time 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.690
 being a channel they will know if you are new to 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.240
 this channel and you want to know about the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.710
 topic or leave the links to the videos 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.690
 I have done on the subject of work 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.480
 below except for this video if 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.710
 you want to check them when I moved 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.500
 Japan I came at the end of the year 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.679
 to settle in and find an apartment 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.320
 get my internet phone line 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.840
 bank account and everything that is 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.910
 need because it takes time I think in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 my case comes something early for me 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 find work there were not many 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 posts out there in October and it was not 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 until December when the classifieds 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.550
 they began to fill with opportunity 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 February work is good date for 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 start sending your applications in March 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.450
 it's already late 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.360
 April is like the surge of hiring the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.670
 happens and many start their new 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.640
 I just started 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.849
 work for my company in an April and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.519
 good from October to April were six 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.519
 months without any income my 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.560
 recommendation is that they come here 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.049
 in January or February for interviews 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.030
 of work and so that they accommodate and they 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.640
 ready for April to be ready 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.439
 to start working or dependent on 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.260
 work that you find it is possible that 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.049
 start before April not all 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.620
 works begin in April 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.260
 but if you are a recent graduate or you already have 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.750
 time you finish your career April is 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.090
 the date the rookies start 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.920
 your jobs here in japan if 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.430
 you have as a student then you will be 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.980
 here in April or already from the month of 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.230
 march to be ready and start your 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.689
 classes and this is just something of 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.370
 information to take into account the 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.310
 make your plans for those who are 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.180
 thinking of coming to Japan either in plan or 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.219
 of student or 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.920
 I'm thinking about making a video more 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.439
 go ahead about my first job in 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.530
 Japan to share my experience with 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.319
 you will not take a while to edit it 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.659
 but to hoist it later ok that's 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.489
 all for this occasion the links to the 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.500
 social networks of the channel and the others
