a device that will work much better for
developing<00:01:53.009> countries<00:01:53.430> where<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.670> don't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
developing countries where you don't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.149 
developing countries where you don't
have<00:01:54.000> electricity<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:55.890> hand

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
have electricity and on the other hand

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
have electricity and on the other hand
is<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> first<00:01:57.119> love<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.780> another

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is one of the first love go with another

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:58.980 
is one of the first love go with another

so<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.979> marbella<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:01.600> invest<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.140> recently

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
so and marbella will invest it recently

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.730 
so and marbella will invest it recently
like<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.100> year<00:02:03.430> or<00:02:03.549> two<00:02:03.700> ago<00:02:03.820> again<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.659> lbc<00:02:05.200> yes

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
like a year or two ago again in lbc yes

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.920 
like a year or two ago again in lbc yes
and<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:06.939> are<00:02:07.060> interested<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.780> this

what is a one-to-one computing project
for<00:02:58.870> education<00:02:59.349> five<00:03:00.099> years<00:03:00.310> ago<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.670> was

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
for education five years ago it was

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.740 
for education five years ago it was
almost<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.680> well<00:03:03.160> nowadays<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.480> want

major<00:03:07.630> internationalization<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:09.280> next

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
major internationalization and this next

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.250 
major internationalization and this next
word<00:03:09.820> well<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> supercharger<00:03:10.810> started<00:03:11.200> this

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
word well a supercharger started this

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.949 
word well a supercharger started this
project<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:13.209> governments<00:03:13.660> are<00:03:13.750> still<00:03:13.900> the

project so the governments are still the
same<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.859> concept<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.489> somehow

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
same is just the concept that somehow

shifted<00:03:16.660> from<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.440> was<00:03:17.650> computer<00:03:18.100> labs<00:03:18.340> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
shifted from what was computer labs and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.479 
shifted from what was computer labs and
now<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.450> rear<00:03:19.570> ADM<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:20.140> warrant<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.799> what

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
now with the rear ADM a warrant one what

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.789 
now with the rear ADM a warrant one what
is<00:03:21.700> always<00:03:22.230> important<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.350> having<00:03:23.500> those

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
is always important is having those

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.800 
is always important is having those
governments<00:03:24.549> those<00:03:24.880> leaders<00:03:25.359> who<00:03:25.600> have<00:03:25.630> a

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
countries or to invest in laptops I will

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.060

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
tell them to invest in education because

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.969 
tell them to invest in education because
education<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.880> components<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:36.229> really

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
education is the components that really

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.860 
education is the components that really
make<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.400> difference<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:37.970> country<00:04:38.389> because

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
make the difference in a country because

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.270 
make the difference in a country because
you're<00:04:39.020> building<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.470> next<00:04:39.590> generation<00:04:39.710> of

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you're building the next generation of

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.879 
you're building the next generation of
the<00:04:41.120> country<00:04:41.539> by<00:04:41.840> investing<00:04:42.320> on<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> children

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
the country by investing on the children

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.100 
the country by investing on the children
so<00:04:43.460> when<00:04:43.940> you're<00:04:44.090> telling<00:04:44.509> it<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.900> leader

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
so when you're telling it to a leader

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
so when you're telling it to a leader
would<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:45.889> like<00:04:46.009> to<00:04:46.190> invest<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:47.199> X<00:04:48.199> amount<00:04:48.530> of

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
would you like to invest in X amount of

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.939 
would you like to invest in X amount of
opportunities<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.870> real<00:04:51.080> I'd<00:04:51.199> invest<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
opportunities of real I'd invest in the

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.129 
opportunities of real I'd invest in the
future<00:04:52.160> of<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.520> country<00:04:52.729> I<00:04:53.120> think<00:04:53.720> everybody

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
future of the country I think everybody

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.379 
future of the country I think everybody
gets<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.560> though<00:04:55.030> let's<00:04:56.030> say<00:04:56.180> for<00:04:56.360> example

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
gets it though let's say for example

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.839 
gets it though let's say for example
Denmark<00:04:57.020> wants<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:57.380> invest<00:04:57.680> should<00:04:58.220> they<00:04:58.370> do<00:04:58.820> a

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
Denmark wants to invest should they do a

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.150 
Denmark wants to invest should they do a
project<00:04:59.120> locally<00:04:59.870> or<00:05:00.110> they<00:05:00.590> just<00:05:00.620> provide

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
project locally or they just provide

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.370 
project locally or they just provide
money<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.759> do<00:05:01.880> it<00:05:02.000> far<00:05:02.240> away<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.990> actually

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
money and do it far away and actually

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.260 
money and do it far away and actually
they<00:05:04.039> should<00:05:04.220> do<00:05:04.310> both<00:05:04.430> left<00:05:04.910> for<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.090> world

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
they should do both left for the world

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.150 
they should do both left for the world
why<00:05:05.690> not<00:05:05.870> children's<00:05:06.500> our<00:05:06.650> children<00:05:07.009> in
