them to check off her makeup but not

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.060 
them to check off her makeup but not
just<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.870> take<00:03:57.050> off<00:03:57.170> nail<00:03:57.410> polish<00:03:57.739> because

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
just to take off nail polish because

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.440 
just to take off nail polish because
they're<00:03:58.220> expensive<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:58.820> think<00:03:58.850> they're<00:03:59.209> I

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
they're expensive I think they're I

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.110 
they're expensive I think they're I
don't<00:04:00.140> know<00:04:00.380> ten<00:04:00.830> fifteen<00:04:00.980> dollars<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.760> pack

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
don't know ten fifteen dollars a pack

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120 
don't know ten fifteen dollars a pack
and<00:04:02.540> more<00:04:03.140> than<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.500> would<00:04:03.769> have<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.950> order

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
and more than that I would have to order

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.479 
and more than that I would have to order
them

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
them

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.550 
them
I<00:04:04.519> guess<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.140> accessibility<00:04:06.140> is<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.290> big

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
I guess the accessibility is the big

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.880 
I guess the accessibility is the big
thing<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.519> was<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:08.090> CVS<00:04:08.780> yesterday<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.739> I

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
thing so I was in CVS yesterday and I

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.380

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
found these and I'm probably the last

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.699

person you guys are probably already

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.350

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.950 
kind that fall apart they're very
durable<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.090> used<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.390> last<00:04:32.540> night<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> take

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
off my makeup and they just did so good

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.300 
off my makeup and they just did so good

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
the ones the ones that have like the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.100 
the ones the ones that have like the
stripes<00:04:37.820> kind<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> base<00:04:38.570> seem<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.930> tear

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
stripes kind of on a base seem to tear

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.870 
stripes kind of on a base seem to tear
apart<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.740> then<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.520> going<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.730> sound

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
apart and then this is going to sound

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.610
