you

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.180 

okay<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.719> particular<00:00:12.869> job<00:00:13.469> requires<00:00:14.010> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
okay this particular job requires a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.269 
okay this particular job requires a
small<00:00:14.639> drop<00:00:15.209> in<00:00:15.240> sink<00:00:15.869> the<00:00:16.500> problem<00:00:16.950> we<00:00:17.070> have

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
small drop in sink the problem we have

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.600 
small drop in sink the problem we have
here<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.939> have<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> custom-made<00:00:19.039> brass<00:00:20.039> sink

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
here is we have a custom-made brass sink

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.880 
here is we have a custom-made brass sink
that<00:00:21.390> doesn't<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.079> template<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.740> have

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that doesn't have a template so we have

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
that doesn't have a template so we have
to<00:00:22.980> actually<00:00:23.099> make<00:00:23.520> our<00:00:24.180> own<00:00:24.240> template<00:00:24.840> here

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
to actually make our own template here

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.959 
to actually make our own template here
now<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.649> is<00:00:25.710> extremely<00:00:26.309> important<00:00:26.849> my

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:26.969 
now this is extremely important my

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.970 
now this is extremely important my
recommendation<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.930> try<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.770> get<00:00:28.950> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
recommendation would be try to get a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.109 
recommendation would be try to get a
template<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.489> you<00:00:29.579> don't<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:29.969> going<00:00:30.059> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
template if you don't you're going to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
template if you don't you're going to
have<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.390> construct<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.989> what<00:00:31.169> we<00:00:31.320> did<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:32.099> we

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have to construct one what we did is we

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.979 
have to construct one what we did is we
made<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.579> template<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
made this template and you can see the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
made this template and you can see the
template<00:00:34.290> fits<00:00:34.590> over<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> sink<00:00:35.399> itself<00:00:35.730> we

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
template fits over the sink itself we

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.850 
template fits over the sink itself we
wanted<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> make<00:00:36.960> sure<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> fits

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
wanted to make sure that it fits

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
wanted to make sure that it fits
securely<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.450> too<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.890> we

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
securely because if it's too big we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
securely because if it's too big we
can't<00:00:41.130> add<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> stone<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.570> want

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
can't add to the stone so we only want

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.270 
can't add to the stone so we only want
to<00:00:42.840> cut<00:00:43.050> once<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.500> measure<00:00:43.710> three<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.100> four

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
to cut once we measure three or four

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.030 
to cut once we measure three or four
times<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.540> we've<00:00:45.690> done<00:00:45.720> here<00:00:46.350> remember

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
times now what we've done here remember

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800 
times now what we've done here remember
when<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> did<00:00:47.400> our<00:00:47.430> templating<00:00:48.030> portion<00:00:48.450> we

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
when we did our templating portion we

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.569 
when we did our templating portion we
actually<00:00:49.140> mark<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> centerline<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.160> our<00:00:50.280> sink

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
actually mark the centerline of our sink

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
actually mark the centerline of our sink
and<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.910> mark<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.360> brought<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:51.750> sink<00:00:51.960> was

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and we mark how brought the sink was

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
and we mark how brought the sink was
going<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.380> come<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.310> have<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> reference

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
going to come in so we have a reference

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to come in so we have a reference
mark<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
mark here and all we're going to do is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
mark here and all we're going to do is
simply<00:00:56.250> place<00:00:56.399> our<00:00:56.640> template<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.300> those

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
simply place our template over those

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.120 
simply place our template over those
marks<00:00:58.050> line<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> up

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
marks line it up

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.110 
marks line it up
double-check<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.309> make<00:01:02.520> sure<00:01:02.700> it's<00:01:02.880> ready<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
double-check it make sure it's ready to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
double-check it make sure it's ready to
go<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:04.350> we're<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.649> to<00:01:04.710> trace<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
go and now we're going to trace that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.870 
go and now we're going to trace that
outline<00:01:09.649> making<00:01:10.649> sure<00:01:10.829> to<00:01:11.040> hold<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.430> template

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
outline making sure to hold the template

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
outline making sure to hold the template
securely<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
securely because you don't want it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
securely because you don't want it
shifting<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.750> big

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
shifting on you and if it's a big

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
shifting on you and if it's a big
template<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.560> probably<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> helper

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
template you can probably have a helper

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
template you can probably have a helper
come<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.750> actually<00:01:19.409> help<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
come in and just actually help you to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
come in and just actually help you to
hold<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.190> template<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.240> sometimes<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
hold the template down or sometimes you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
hold the template down or sometimes you
can<00:01:21.960> take<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> small<00:01:23.760> enough

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
can take them this one is small enough

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.250 
can take them this one is small enough
that<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> worry<00:01:25.170> about

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
that we really don't have to worry about

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.899 
that we really don't have to worry about
it<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> hold<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> free<00:01:26.220> securely<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it we can hold it free securely got a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.350 
it we can hold it free securely got a
trace<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.900> carefully<00:01:31.440> lifted<00:01:31.830> up<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:33.240> have

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
trace and is carefully lifted up we have

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
trace and is carefully lifted up we have
an<00:01:33.510> outline<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> our<00:01:34.140> sink<00:01:34.440> now<00:01:35.299> we<00:01:36.299> have

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
an outline of our sink now we have

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
an outline of our sink now we have
straight<00:01:36.780> lines<00:01:37.080> here<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> four

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
straight lines here here here on four

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
straight lines here here here on four
sides<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:40.260> radius<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.979> there's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
sides but we have this radius so there's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340 
sides but we have this radius so there's
several<00:01:41.340> ways<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> handle<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.210> radius<00:01:42.720> one

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
several ways to handle that radius one

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
several ways to handle that radius one
way<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.430> slowly<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:45.119> some

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
way would be to just slowly make some

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.300 
way would be to just slowly make some
small<00:01:45.840> cuts<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.860> called<00:01:47.010> cone

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
small cuts at there which is called cone

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
small cuts at there which is called cone
cutting<00:01:47.760> which<00:01:48.150> takes<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.689> long<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
cutting which takes very long to do the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.760 
cutting which takes very long to do the
easiest<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> take<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> four<00:01:52.080> bit<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
easiest way is to take a four bit take a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
easiest way is to take a four bit take a
core<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> size<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> radius

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
core of it to the size of the radius

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
core of it to the size of the radius
pour<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> corners<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:56.040> four<00:01:56.400> corners

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pour out the corners all four corners

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
pour out the corners all four corners
you'll<00:01:57.330> have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.540> perfect<00:01:58.020> arc<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.740> that's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you'll have a perfect arc and that's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
you'll have a perfect arc and that's
what<00:01:59.009> we're<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.240> we're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what we're going to do here now we're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
what we're going to do here now we're
going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.900> make<00:02:01.110> these<00:02:01.380> four<00:02:01.710> holes<00:02:02.040> first

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
going to make these four holes first

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
going to make these four holes first
flip<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> stone<00:02:04.080> over<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.710> we're<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
flip the stone over and we're going to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.380 
flip the stone over and we're going to
show<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.400> put<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:05.729> rods<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
show you how to put some rods in the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020 
show you how to put some rods in the
back<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> stone<00:02:07.049> flip<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.159> over<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
back of the stone flip it back over and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:38.440 
back of the stone flip it back over and
straight<00:02:09.360> cuts<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.140> let's<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.740> done

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.089 

okay<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.810> our<00:02:39.959> sinkhole<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.799> on<00:02:40.950> our

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
okay with our sinkhole here on our

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.460 
okay with our sinkhole here on our
island<00:02:41.129> they<00:02:41.730> drilled<00:02:42.060> four<00:02:42.450> four<00:02:42.900> levels<00:02:43.379> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
island they drilled four four levels in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.559 
island they drilled four four levels in
each<00:02:43.620> corner<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.580> what<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.909> could<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.269> at<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
each corner now what we could do at this

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.570 
each corner now what we could do at this
point<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.110> finish<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.709> cutout<00:02:47.069> by<00:02:47.250> cutting

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
point is finish the cutout by cutting

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.610 
point is finish the cutout by cutting
the<00:02:47.670> sink<00:02:47.910> entirely<00:02:48.239> out<00:02:48.599> however<00:02:48.810> this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the sink entirely out however this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.800 
the sink entirely out however this
island<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.519> large<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.239> afraid<00:02:51.510> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
island is so large that I'm afraid that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.420 
island is so large that I'm afraid that
if<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:51.930> try<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> move<00:02:52.440> it'll<00:02:52.709> crack<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.280> what

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
if we try to move it'll crack so what

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.890 
if we try to move it'll crack so what
we're<00:02:53.549> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.599> we<00:02:54.690> call<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
we're going to do is what we call a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.020 
we're going to do is what we call a
plunge<00:02:55.290> cut<00:02:55.379> or<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.129> call<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> score<00:02:56.730> cut

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
plunge cut or what we call a score cut

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.550 
plunge cut or what we call a score cut
in<00:02:57.180> other<00:02:57.329> words<00:02:57.569> we're<00:02:58.049> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> take<00:02:58.409> this

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
in other words we're going to take this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.470 
in other words we're going to take this
saw<00:02:58.799> blade<00:02:58.829> here<00:02:59.400> I'm<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.879> to<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.000> down<00:03:00.209> just

a little tiny bit make our score mark

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
a little tiny bit make our score mark
and<00:03:03.599> then<00:03:03.840> stop<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.590> then<00:03:04.860> take<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.190> piece

move it to the field and finish our cut
out<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.799> field<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.519> let's<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:08.819> started

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.150 

add<00:03:14.950> water<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.900> gently<00:03:16.900> push<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.620> blade<00:03:17.860> into

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
add water and gently push the blade into

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.280 
add water and gently push the blade into
the<00:03:18.340> stone<00:03:18.670> itself<00:03:19.030> making<00:03:19.930> sure<00:03:20.080> it's<00:03:20.200> all

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
the stone itself making sure it's all

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.530 
the stone itself making sure it's all
the<00:03:20.440> way<00:03:20.470> down<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.010> then<00:03:21.700> slowly<00:03:22.000> move

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
the way down and then slowly move

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:38.730 
the way down and then slowly move
forward<00:03:23.110> making<00:03:23.410> your<00:03:23.650> score<00:03:23.950> cuts

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.810 

okay<00:03:39.740> now<00:03:39.950> we're<00:03:40.130> ready<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.460> rob<00:03:40.670> this

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
okay now we're ready to rob this

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.400 
okay now we're ready to rob this
particular<00:03:41.240> countertop<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.900> let<00:03:42.020> me<00:03:42.080> explain

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
particular countertop and let me explain

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.500 
particular countertop and let me explain
what<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:43.040> we<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.460> a<00:03:43.490> sink<00:03:43.850> opening<00:03:44.270> here

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
what that is we have a sink opening here

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.570 
what that is we have a sink opening here
anytime<00:03:44.990> you<00:03:45.140> have<00:03:45.260> a<00:03:45.320> sink<00:03:45.650> opening<00:03:46.130> you<00:03:46.490> have

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
anytime you have a sink opening you have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.340 
anytime you have a sink opening you have
a<00:03:46.670> very<00:03:46.940> weak<00:03:47.150> area<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> stone<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.140> break

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
a very weak area the stone can break

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.500 
a very weak area the stone can break
very<00:03:48.380> easily<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.520> what<00:03:49.640> we<00:03:49.730> basically<00:03:49.940> do<00:03:50.330> is

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
very easily so what we basically do is

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.260 
very easily so what we basically do is
we<00:03:50.660> take<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.140> steel<00:03:51.590> rods<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.250> we<00:03:52.850> cut<00:03:53.240> a

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
we take the steel rods and we cut a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.120 
we take the steel rods and we cut a
groove<00:03:53.570> in<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.140> stone<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.860> see<00:03:55.040> how

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
groove in the stone and to see how

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.160 
groove in the stone and to see how
that's<00:03:55.310> done<00:03:55.490> in<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.700> second<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.270> we<00:03:56.660> insert

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
that's done in a second and we insert

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.600 
that's done in a second and we insert
them<00:03:57.350> into<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.740> down<00:03:57.980> with<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.220> little<00:03:58.430> bit<00:03:58.520> of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
them into this down with a little bit of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.850 
them into this down with a little bit of
glue<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.450> strength<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.020> area<00:04:00.290> we

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
glue and that strength of that area we

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.530 
glue and that strength of that area we
let<00:04:01.010> them<00:04:01.160> dry<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.760> hook<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.060> stone<00:04:02.270> over

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
let them dry and hook the stone over

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.540 
let them dry and hook the stone over
we'll<00:04:02.720> finish<00:04:02.900> our<00:04:03.140> cut<00:04:03.350> out<00:04:03.500> we're<00:04:04.310> good<00:04:04.460> to

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
we'll finish our cut out we're good to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.540 
we'll finish our cut out we're good to
go<00:04:04.580> let's<00:04:04.910> go<00:04:05.120> with<00:04:05.300> it

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.890 

when<00:04:11.550> making<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.030> grooves<00:04:12.300> with<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.510> rotting

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
when making a grooves with a rotting

blade again nice steady movements plunge

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.660 
blade again nice steady movements plunge
down<00:04:15.720> into<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.080> stone<00:04:16.320> plenty<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.220> water<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
down into the stone plenty of water and

oK we've already cut our grooves the
stone<00:04:48.090> has<00:04:48.240> now<00:04:48.390> been<00:04:48.660> dry<00:04:48.990> now<00:04:49.470> ready<00:04:49.800> to

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
stone has now been dry now ready to

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.680 
stone has now been dry now ready to
insert<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> rods<00:04:50.670> now<00:04:51.300> what's<00:04:51.540> really

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
insert the rods now what's really

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.150 
insert the rods now what's really
important<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.320> these<00:04:52.470> particular<00:04:52.890> type<00:04:53.130> of

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
important is these particular type of

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.460 
important is these particular type of
rods<00:04:53.490> come<00:04:54.150> with<00:04:54.270> an<00:04:54.390> oil<00:04:54.630> on<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.170> they<00:04:55.290> need<00:04:55.440> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
rods come with an oil on so they need to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.350 
rods come with an oil on so they need to
be<00:04:55.620> cleaned<00:04:55.980> thoroughly<00:04:56.130> before<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:57.030> insert

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
be cleaned thoroughly before you insert

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.910

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
to pull out of the groove and we don't

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.130 
to pull out of the groove and we don't
want<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.760> can<00:05:12.150> see<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.420> oil<00:05:12.450> on<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.960> rag

want that you can see the oil on the rag

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.790 
want that you can see the oil on the rag
here<00:05:14.180> next<00:05:15.180> what<00:05:15.330> we're<00:05:15.450> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.720> do<00:05:15.930> is<00:05:16.560> take

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
here next what we're going to do is take

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.130 
here next what we're going to do is take
our<00:05:17.040> glue<00:05:17.250> put<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.330> container<00:05:18.630> you're

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
our glue put it in a container you're

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.690 
our glue put it in a container you're
not<00:05:19.290> going<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.560> start<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:20.070> up<00:05:20.280> because<00:05:20.460> it

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
not going to start going up because it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.630 
not going to start going up because it
will<00:05:20.760> melt<00:05:21.500> for<00:05:22.500> enough<00:05:22.860> glue<00:05:23.100> in<00:05:23.280> there<00:05:23.490> I

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
will melt for enough glue in there I

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.540 
will melt for enough glue in there I
like<00:05:23.970> using<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.360> flowing<00:05:24.630> gray<00:05:25.220> simply<00:05:26.220> because

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
like using a flowing gray simply because

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.820 
like using a flowing gray simply because
it<00:05:26.730> allows<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.210> flow<00:05:27.480> into<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.900> groove<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
it allows it to flow into the groove and

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.920 
it allows it to flow into the groove and
then<00:05:28.890> even<00:05:29.130> consistencies<00:05:29.850> in<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.060> stuff<00:05:30.270> you

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
then even consistencies in the stuff you

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.560 
then even consistencies in the stuff you
want<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.140> add<00:05:31.320> your<00:05:31.560> harbor<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:33.030> this<00:05:33.300> case

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
want to add your harbor in this case

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.150 
want to add your harbor in this case
we're<00:05:33.750> going<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> add<00:05:33.960> approximately<00:05:34.830> 2%

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
we're going to add approximately 2%

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.540 
we're going to add approximately 2%
hardener<00:05:36.290> this<00:05:37.290> stuff<00:05:37.530> sets<00:05:37.800> up<00:05:37.980> pretty<00:05:38.190> quick

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
hardener this stuff sets up pretty quick

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.910 
hardener this stuff sets up pretty quick
so<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.150> do<00:05:39.630> want<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.870> work<00:05:40.020> fast<00:05:40.380> what<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.800> do

completely<00:06:26.380> submerged<00:06:26.890> I<00:06:27.220> don't<00:06:27.670> think<00:06:27.850> you

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
completely submerged I don't think you

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.250 
completely submerged I don't think you
need<00:06:28.090> stainless<00:06:28.540> because<00:06:28.690> it's<00:06:29.050> completely

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
need stainless because it's completely

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.530 
need stainless because it's completely
encapsulated<00:06:30.160> it's<00:06:30.640> not<00:06:30.880> going<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.150> rust<00:06:31.330> on
