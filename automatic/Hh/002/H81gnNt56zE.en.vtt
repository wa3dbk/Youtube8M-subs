00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello everyone new video today and this one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.270
 time I would like to try with you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 these new maybelline products that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.120
 they are tattoos for nail art so yes 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 they call maybelline color show gods 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.850
 tattoo and I took both the version and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 it's called the financial district 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 collection and that is what we say and more 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.710
 inspired by money and therefore also by gold 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.439
 to so many golden inspired stickers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 the color of money is also what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.579
 it's called the brooklyn collection that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.860
 instead it is a bit more other files anyway a 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.500
 many decorations inspired by murals is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.500
 a little more rock let's say I don't know how 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 defining them seem to me very products 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 interesting and very nice indeed I have 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.840
 decided to try them for the first time 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 with you and in short to see result 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.109
 how I found them from lemons and these 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.000
 cost the euro budget to 50 and zero 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.719
 I believe they will be a limited edition 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.320
 therefore they will not be found then anymore 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.510
 that is a thing of now but I think that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 these stickers among these tattoos for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.490
 nail art are really nice because 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 for those who leave a little like me and therefore have 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.200
 difficulty drawing things on 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.229
 these nails always give a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
 nice effect and still go to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.150
 complete the manicure 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 so let's try them together for 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.229
 first thing I laid on all my nails 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 this collistar enamel that is the one in the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.840
 white color france and then I chose to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.659
 use these stickers a little 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 more street style are very comfortable for 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.330
 cases manage to detach without need 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 of the scissors 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.590
 once the speaker is detached, yes 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.150
 remove the protective film and then 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 I'm going to apply it on the nail in the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 position I want 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.950
 cotton only or a sponge for con 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.960
 I'll take some water a little later 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.160
 I see how much the quantity is if it is not enough for me 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.440
 I still use it and simply go to 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.630
 lend the sticker so that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.640
 adhere to the nail is that the tattoo 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.640
 transport yourself on the nail 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.370
 after about 30 seconds it should be 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.709
 ready to be removed I go 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170
 remove it very gently and the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.030
 result is this 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 and then continues on all the other nails 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.830
 I do exactly the same thing I go to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.500
 remove the stickers that already has 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.070
 prepared and the nice thing about these 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.390
 stickers is that on the other side you see 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.430
 let 's say the negative of what you are 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.280
 doing so you know where you are 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.470
 attacking and how the printing of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.470
 what you are attacking 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.290
 so for the ring finger I chose the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.879
 bulldog which is what you see less 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.980
 because white on white 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.150
 then I went on I used i 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.879
 murals and used both on the index and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.370
 I'm on the middle on the index 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.409
 putting in this moment and me 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.940
 I really like the murals the only one 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.530
 what was I to stay a little farther down 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.049
 in the nail I like it a lot 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.060
 the effect they have and to finish on 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.239
 inch or but on what I preferred that 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.340
 it was the skull with all the flowers it is 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.110
 really very very basic like 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.620
 in short, we did tattoos from little ones 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.450
 to fix everything I used a short top 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.270
 of workers now I'm using that 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.880
 because I found it in a kit is anyway 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.650
 I like the end result 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.930
 very obviously in this case it is a lot 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.130
 load but one can also make an accent 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.710
 manicure 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.319
 the only thing the thumb is a little crooked 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.840
 I absolutely have to refine the technique 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.019
 then this was the result 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.269
 obviously I absolutely have to improve 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.189
 the technique being the first time that I 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.150
 I used to have made some mistakes 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:04.280
 they go slightly more centered 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.010
 we need to pay attention to it, though 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.200
 the product I like so much is comfortable and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.170
 however, I will then put you in the info box 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.269
 also the duration I think will be good 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.280
 because anyway once towards the top 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.389
 coat should seal everything 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.940
 on the nail 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.310
 in short it seems to me a nice product and 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.530
 the result is very particular if then 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.440
 wanted to see other nail art maybe 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.599
 made with other stickers 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.599
 let me know in the comments 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.000
 in any case let me also know if by 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.220
 In case you found them, you have them 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080
 already approved if these products there 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.270
 therefore they are curious as usual 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.780
 let me know everything in the comments here 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.270
 under 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.220
 I hope the video was useful to you 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.090
 I send a big kiss and we see each other 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.780
 to the next 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.780
 Hello
