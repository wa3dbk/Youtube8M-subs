manual<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:24.960> might<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> aware<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> there

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
manual you might not be aware that there

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.550 
manual you might not be aware that there
is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.430> procedure<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.900> put<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> top<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is a procedure to put the top up and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.930 
is a procedure to put the top up and
down<00:00:28.740> manually<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:31.369> don't<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
down manually I don't really like the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.729 
down manually I don't really like the
procedure<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.660> describe<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> because<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
procedure as they describe it because it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.639 
procedure as they describe it because it
it<00:00:35.280> seems<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> little<00:00:36.090> complicated<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.020> they

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it seems a little complicated and they

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
it seems a little complicated and they
talk<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.250> dangerous<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.360> how

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
talk about how dangerous it is and how

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.090 
talk about how dangerous it is and how
you<00:00:39.540> should<00:00:39.840> only<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> an<00:00:40.290> emergency<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you should only do it an emergency and I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
you should only do it an emergency and I
don't<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.790> kind<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
don't really like that kind of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
don't really like that kind of
terminology<00:00:43.399> they<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.550> talk<00:00:44.910> about

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
terminology they also talk about

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
terminology they also talk about
releasing<00:00:45.360> hydraulic<00:00:45.989> pressure<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
releasing hydraulic pressure which is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
releasing hydraulic pressure which is
something<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.789> do

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
something you're going to have to do

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.330 
something you're going to have to do
before<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> move<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> top<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.410> any<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
before you move the top or any of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
before you move the top or any of the
parts<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:51.570> there's<00:00:52.110> pressure<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> system

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
parts if there's pressure on the system

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
parts if there's pressure on the system
which<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.850> almost<00:00:53.969> guarantee<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
which I can almost guarantee you if you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
which I can almost guarantee you if you
hit<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.590> button<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.039> nothing<00:00:56.280> happens

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
hit that button and nothing happens

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790 
hit that button and nothing happens
there<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> no<00:00:57.420> pressure<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> system<00:00:58.379> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there is no pressure on the system these

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.380 
there is no pressure on the system these
cars<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.309> ride<00:00:59.579> around<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.030> pressure<00:01:00.270> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
cars don't ride around with pressure on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
cars don't ride around with pressure on
the<00:01:00.539> system<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> time<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.649> did<00:01:01.890> we'd

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the system all the time they did we'd

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
the system all the time they did we'd
have<00:01:02.129> we'd<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> hydraulic<00:01:03.090> fluid<00:01:03.510> leaking

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
have we'd have a hydraulic fluid leaking

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.560 
have we'd have a hydraulic fluid leaking
all<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> place<00:01:04.199> all<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> time

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
all over the place all the time

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
all over the place all the time
but<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.900> worried<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:07.740> there

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
but if you're worried that maybe there

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370 
but if you're worried that maybe there
is<00:01:08.159> pressure<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> system<00:01:09.000> turn<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> car

now you're ready to actually put the top

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.440 
now you're ready to actually put the top
up<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> first<00:01:31.229> thing<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> need

very<00:05:37.080> hard<00:05:37.350> for<00:05:37.560> me<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:38.540> look<00:05:39.540> around<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:39.900> corner

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
very hard for me to look around a corner

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.060 
very hard for me to look around a corner
all<00:05:41.520> right<00:05:41.639> I<00:05:41.730> think<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:42.030> got<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.300> on<00:05:42.419> there<00:05:42.630> I

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
all right I think I got it on there I

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:51.200 
all right I think I got it on there I
guess<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.220> do<00:05:47.900> lift<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:49.050> up<00:05:49.169> now<00:05:49.590> let<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.700> rear

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
guess I do lift it up now let the rear

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.820 
guess I do lift it up now let the rear
boat<00:05:51.419> just<00:05:51.660> drop<00:05:51.930> on<00:05:52.080> its<00:05:52.230> own<00:05:52.970> when<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.120> done

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
boat just drop on its own when it's done

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.200 
boat just drop on its own when it's done
don't<00:05:55.830> forget<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.280> put<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.490> divider<00:05:56.730> back<00:05:57.000> up

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
don't forget to put the divider back up

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.830 
don't forget to put the divider back up
which<00:05:57.600> I<00:05:57.780> did<00:05:59.780> and<00:06:00.780> just<00:06:01.190> gently<00:06:02.720> lower<00:06:03.720> the

which I did and just gently lower the

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.890 
which I did and just gently lower the
top<00:06:04.139> in<00:06:04.350> there<00:06:04.850> and<00:06:05.850> hold<00:06:06.060> on<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.480> it<00:06:06.510> because

you<00:06:07.020> really<00:06:07.230> don't<00:06:07.410> want<00:06:07.560> it<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.740> just<00:06:07.800> drop

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
you really don't want it to just drop

I<00:06:32.250> do<00:06:32.430> this<00:06:32.580> about<00:06:32.790> three<00:06:32.970> times<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.389> year<00:06:33.570> it

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
I do this about three times a year it

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.120 
I do this about three times a year it
does<00:06:33.840> not<00:06:33.870> confuse<00:06:34.380> the<00:06:34.500> electronics<00:06:35.040> it

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
does not confuse the electronics it

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.200 
does not confuse the electronics it
doesn't<00:06:35.370> appear<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.580> hurt<00:06:35.790> anything

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
doesn't appear to hurt anything

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.909 
doesn't appear to hurt anything
I've<00:06:36.600> never<00:06:36.870> encountered<00:06:37.050> pressure<00:06:37.590> on<00:06:37.800> the

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
I've never encountered pressure on the

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.570 
I've never encountered pressure on the
system<00:06:38.310> however<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.970> do<00:06:39.330> it<00:06:39.660> as<00:06:39.810> a<00:06:39.870> planned

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
system however I do it as a planned

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.370 
system however I do it as a planned
course<00:06:41.580> of<00:06:41.820> action<00:06:42.210> if<00:06:42.390> you've<00:06:43.110> hit<00:06:43.350> the

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
course of action if you've hit the

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.320 
course of action if you've hit the
button<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:44.040> the<00:06:44.280> pump<00:06:44.520> has<00:06:44.669> started<00:06:45.030> to<00:06:45.120> run

button and the pump has started to run

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.540 
button and the pump has started to run
and<00:06:45.540> nothing<00:06:46.080> happens<00:06:46.470> you've<00:06:47.070> probably<00:06:47.310> got

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
and nothing happens you've probably got

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.600 
and nothing happens you've probably got
a<00:06:47.580> partially<00:06:48.080> pressurized<00:06:49.080> system<00:06:49.289> and<00:06:49.620> okay

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
a partially pressurized system and okay

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.040 
a partially pressurized system and okay
fine<00:06:50.910> you<00:06:51.030> probably<00:06:51.330> should<00:06:51.510> go<00:06:51.720> through<00:06:51.960> the

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
fine you probably should go through the

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.230 
fine you probably should go through the
procedure<00:06:52.440> to<00:06:52.680> relief<00:06:52.950> to<00:06:53.610> relieve<00:06:53.910> the

procedure to relief to relieve the
