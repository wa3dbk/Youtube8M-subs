00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.640 
I couldn't really say what actually
inspired<00:00:11.240> me<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.750> start<00:00:11.960> doing<00:00:12.170> it<00:00:12.440> but<00:00:12.620> you

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
inspired me to start doing it but you

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.259 
inspired me to start doing it but you
know<00:00:12.830> you<00:00:13.160> see<00:00:13.370> something<00:00:13.700> wrong<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.180> nobody
