00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.950
 and why do you do it because I want to know 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.950
 to his mother 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.340
 I do not know a little play is see that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 once they put me that I had to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.939
 renew the driver's license 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.850
 and they put a little screen on you that you have to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 be with a command to see how it's going to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 act road and good almost not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.800
 suspend 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780
 we would like to make you as a kind of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.579
 interview if the first thing does not allow it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.559
 of everything you know we are going to be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.079
 seeing the thousands of people well yes 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 I think yes a lot and almost everything 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.530
 Well, it's usually people, kids, 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 you would say to those children the first thing that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.320
 they study that they take advantage of the time 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.539
 to learn 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.190
 I am 50 years old and I am still studying 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.469
 parentheses and a mediation master 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.629
 so for me the training is very 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.629
 important not to the drug of course 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.650
 nor drink anything enjoy nature 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.860
 and from life there are many things that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.860
 do 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.010
 paint pictures look I'm painted 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.610
 murals by diego rivera I copy this 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.220
 is a Mexican painter then good 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 someday if you allow me you could see 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.240
 something in the house I have the house decorated 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 with the four these from Diego Rivera and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.260
 I do not know if you know Frida Kahlo is a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:40.430
 colorful muralist painting a thing like that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:40.430
 but pictures of the pictures in the video 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.080
 this is not you already know that you already know 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 that your son uploads videos to youtube and that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.280
 it gets dangerous puts movies in the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.130
 who puts on wigs and does and if not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 forgetfulness is a bit weird it was fun not 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 I know I think that YouTube is in a 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.600
 dynamic new world not and good that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.630
 you young people are a means to 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.420
 the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 if we say without the manipulation of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.410
 means that always guide you a little bit 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.960
 this is a free means for people 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.790
 like us and I see it well and I think 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.950
 fun to do these things and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.570
 really valleys like this at home or is it a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.310
 little more character what he has created 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:35.440
 on youtube google is like that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:37.390
 he is special is very familiar and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.040
 he likes a lot the family has not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.320
 got into this world always supports you 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.210
 I've always said that dreams a 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.480
 person has to pursue a dream and 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.040
 do not stay if you want to do something you do 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.720
 your son has also told us that you see 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.570
 every day where you know only he 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:02.080
 so if the others do not see something of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.970
 you I have to call me 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.690
 I'm starting on youtube that this is 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.690
 new for me too 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.560
 Well, well, I said to him and I say 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.100
 because he writes a little and I'm having 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 a novelty 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.140
 I say then I can post to it that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.910
 cheat tells me that of that nothing 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.270
 tell him I have life and you give me one 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.270
 public 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.940
 I really admire mothers like you 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.420
 what do you do everything because home work 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.910
 study and now I'm going to work this 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.490
 I work at night and I see why I have 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.070
 much debate with valley because we know 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.080
 that is called Antonio and I tell him I 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.120
 clear to bite him I call him Antonio 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.220
 because he does not like it but I say that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.170
 It seems that he does not like it when I say 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.610
 my antonio seems very nice because 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.470
 you do not want us to call you, not that 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.570
 that was not the best it can be because 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.660
 the father is called antonio the grandfather if 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.360
 love all this is called antonio the cousin 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.280
 it's called antonio antÃ³n can be out there 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.790
 know I bring you the humitos as 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.500
 We knew others cut him the night in 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.860
 summer the father makes the squares with 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.200
 the sangria we are not careful the 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.940
 room is a jet knows the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.380
 room a little after since I did not 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.389
 listening is a disaster although it is how 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.030
 is this that does not listen to me now 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.610
 this is a disaster you could do the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.289
 famous phrase of his core son that is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.659
 what he says when when he says with 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.569
 that voice that everyone says is 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.249
 very bad to invite everyone 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.439
 tells us water only missing that his mother to 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.039
 domicile and nuclear and no longer part missile 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.139
 nuclear and start giving things 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.139
 good good I that part the truth that 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.740
 It gives me a little cut worth missing 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.740
 nuclear 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:11.569
 x 20 maybe less treatment 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.360
 beauty that was spoiled me a little bit 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.430
 good rose has been a pleasure and someday 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.409
 you want to talk to us or with sophie 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.599
 that speaks a lot also because they tell us and 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.890
 we are here 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:31.450
 equally delighted but unknown 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:31.450
 but if you're in the game 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.180
 One Two Three
