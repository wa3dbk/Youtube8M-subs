we<00:01:13.470> found<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> nasty<00:01:14.250> bug<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.610> cutthroat

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.940 
we found this nasty bug with cutthroat
where<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.480> damage<00:01:15.810> amplification<00:01:15.990> wasn't

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
where the damage amplification wasn't

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
where the damage amplification wasn't
actually<00:01:17.280> applying<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.120> we<00:01:18.210> fixed<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.570> bug

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
actually applying so we fixed the bug

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
actually applying so we fixed the bug
but<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> causes<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.620> huge<00:01:19.650> spike<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.640> his

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but this causes a huge spike in his

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.830 
but this causes a huge spike in his
liking<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.240> damage<00:01:21.510> output

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
liking and damage output

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.750 
liking and damage output
so<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.500> reducing<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> damage<00:01:23.370> a<00:01:23.580> bit

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
so we're also reducing the damage a bit

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.340 
so we're also reducing the damage a bit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
help these characters help their mid

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.540 
help these characters help their mid
game<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.350> help<00:01:43.470> their<00:01:43.590> late<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.040> just

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
game and help their late game and just

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.070 
game and help their late game and just
accomplish<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.060> goal<00:01:45.120> but<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:45.840> she's<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
accomplish that goal but now she's a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.390 
accomplish that goal but now she's a
little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.530> over<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.830> top<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> laning

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
little bit over the top of the laning

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.910 
little bit over the top of the laning
phase<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.820> we're<00:01:47.970> targeting<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.360> few<00:01:48.600> nerfs

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
phase so we're targeting a few nerfs

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.230 
phase so we're targeting a few nerfs
specifically<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.100> her<00:01:50.190> early<00:01:50.460> game<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
specifically for her early game the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
specifically for her early game the
first<00:01:51.510> one<00:01:51.630> we're<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:51.900> is<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:53.010> lowing

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
first one we're doing is we're lowing

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
first one we're doing is we're lowing
her<00:01:53.430> base<00:01:53.670> health<00:01:53.970> regeneration<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.050> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
her base health regeneration this is to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.540 
her base health regeneration this is to
allow<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.410> little<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.710> counter<00:01:56.070> play<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.370> lane

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
allow a little more counter play in lane

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.950 
allow a little more counter play in lane
when<00:01:56.940> an<00:01:57.030> opponent<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.720> able<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
when an opponent actually is able to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.720

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
land some damage on Riven it's gonna

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.250 
land some damage on Riven it's gonna
stick<00:02:00.060> better<00:02:00.210> than<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.480> used<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.720> she's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
really good tools

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
really good tools

the<00:02:07.590> battlefield<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.910> gives<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.269> lot<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the battlefield this gives a lot of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.790 
the battlefield this gives a lot of
control<00:02:09.899> urban<00:02:10.110> players<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.500> when<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.679> take

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
control urban players and when to take

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.320 
control urban players and when to take
any<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.069> those<00:02:11.129> tools<00:02:11.430> away<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:12.030> thought<00:02:12.209> we'd

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
any of those tools away we thought we'd

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.490 
any of those tools away we thought we'd
chip<00:02:12.510> away<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.780> base<00:02:12.930> DES<00:02:13.140> instead

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
chip away at the base DES instead

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
chip away at the base DES instead
alright<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:14.790> understand<00:02:15.390> where<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
alright so I also understand where the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.030 
alright so I also understand where the
chain

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
chain

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.819 
chain
cool<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.670> her<00:02:16.969> ultimate<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.480> well<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.709> we're

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
cool down her ultimate as well so we're

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.440 
cool down her ultimate as well so we're
increasing<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.280> cooldown<00:02:19.519> on<00:02:19.939> the<00:02:20.090> early

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
increasing the cooldown on the early

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.179 
increasing the cooldown on the early
ranks<00:02:20.689> of<00:02:20.780> her<00:02:20.840> ultimate<00:02:21.200> especially<00:02:21.680> because

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
ranks of her ultimate especially because

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.559 
ranks of her ultimate especially because
right<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:22.549> she's<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.909> snowballing<00:02:23.329> top

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
right now she's just snowballing top

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.729 
right now she's just snowballing top
lane<00:02:23.780> too<00:02:24.049> hard

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
lane too hard

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.949 
lane too hard
we<00:02:25.489> actually<00:02:25.609> like<00:02:25.879> where<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.239> again<00:02:26.569> late

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
we actually like where it is again late

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.270 
we actually like where it is again late
game<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.200> mid<00:02:27.500> game<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.769> her<00:02:27.829> performance

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
game and mid game in her performance

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.830 
game and mid game in her performance
there<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:28.969> problem<00:02:29.269> is<00:02:29.329> if<00:02:29.480> she<00:02:29.569> gets<00:02:29.599> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
there but the problem is if she gets it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.360 
there but the problem is if she gets it
early<00:02:30.170> lead<00:02:30.379> on<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.799> gets<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.010> little<00:02:31.219> bit

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
early lead on you and gets a little bit

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.800 
early lead on you and gets a little bit
of<00:02:31.430> an<00:02:31.489> edge<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.609> gets<00:02:31.909> a<00:02:32.000> kill<00:02:32.209> off<00:02:32.359> by<00:02:32.689> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
of an edge and gets a kill off by the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.360 
of an edge and gets a kill off by the
time<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.049> respawn<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:33.829> back<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.159> Lane

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
time you respawn and get back to Lane

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.069 
time you respawn and get back to Lane
her<00:02:34.549> Ultimates<00:02:34.939> already<00:02:35.359> able<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.840> cast

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.140 
her Ultimates already able to be cast
again<00:02:36.439> and<00:02:36.590> she'll<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:36.980> kill<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:37.970> and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150

over and over again and is it causing

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.349 
over and over again and is it causing
her<00:02:40.159> to<00:02:40.250> snowball<00:02:40.609> a<00:02:40.640> little<00:02:40.970> bit<00:02:41.090> too<00:02:41.239> much

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
her to snowball a little bit too much

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
changes were overall in the right

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.050 
changes were overall in the right
direction<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.980> actually<00:02:55.370> contribute<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.939> lot

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
direction and actually contribute a lot

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.339 
direction and actually contribute a lot
to<00:02:56.239> sort<00:02:56.359> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.569> healthy<00:02:56.900> gameplay<00:02:57.200> these

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
to sort of the healthy gameplay these

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.990 
to sort of the healthy gameplay these
characters<00:02:57.709> can<00:02:57.950> bring<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:58.760> we<00:02:58.879> actually

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000

the<00:04:12.349> problem<00:04:12.709> there's<00:04:12.889> two<00:04:13.009> problems<00:04:13.310> with<00:04:13.400> it

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
the problem there's two problems with it

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.280 
the problem there's two problems with it
right<00:04:13.639> now<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:14.389> first<00:04:14.569> problem<00:04:14.989> is<00:04:15.079> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
right now the first problem is the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.020 
right now the first problem is the
caster<00:04:15.739> age<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:15.949> really<00:04:16.190> really<00:04:16.579> long<00:04:16.789> it's

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
caster age is really really long it's

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.819 
caster age is really really long it's
far<00:04:17.419> outside<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.079> her<00:04:18.169> stealth<00:04:18.440> detection

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
far outside of her stealth detection

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.589 
far outside of her stealth detection
radius<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:19.579> therefore<00:04:19.880> she<00:04:20.030> can<00:04:20.150> base<00:04:20.269> pieces

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
radius so therefore she can base pieces

early ranks to cripple the slow % is
coming<00:05:21.620> down<00:05:21.889> it's<00:05:22.370> just<00:05:22.520> giving<00:05:22.760> him<00:05:22.820> too

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
coming down it's just giving him too

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.550

much gank strength especially in the

much gank strength especially in the
early<00:05:24.830> game<00:05:24.860> also<00:05:25.490> we're<00:05:25.910> reducing<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.360> cast

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
early game also we're reducing the cast

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.290

the<00:05:29.660> reason<00:05:29.900> for<00:05:30.080> this<00:05:30.169> is<00:05:30.380> once<00:05:30.620> he<00:05:30.740> marks<00:05:31.070> you

lines in the patch notes about this but
they're<00:05:55.430> all<00:05:55.520> geared<00:05:55.729> around<00:05:55.850> two<00:05:56.450> different

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
they're all geared around two different

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.020 
they're all geared around two different
things<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.620> first<00:05:57.800> beam<00:05:58.100> we<00:05:58.550> still<00:05:58.789> think

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
things the first beam we still think

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.760 
things the first beam we still think
that<00:05:59.060> area<00:05:59.510> of<00:05:59.570> effect<00:05:59.870> junglers<00:06:00.200> are<00:06:00.380> a

that area of effect junglers are a

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.260 
that area of effect junglers are a
little<00:06:01.130> bit<00:06:01.310> too<00:06:01.460> dominant<00:06:01.880> over<00:06:02.000> their

little bit too dominant over their

little bit too dominant over their
single<00:06:02.660> target<00:06:02.990> counterparts<00:06:03.470> so<00:06:03.979> we're

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
single target counterparts so we're

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.409 
single target counterparts so we're
taking<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.430> little<00:06:04.550> bit<00:06:04.729> more<00:06:04.789> health<00:06:05.090> out<00:06:05.300> of
