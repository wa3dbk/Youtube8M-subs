00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello good morning I'm already pÃ©rez 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.290
 veterinarian and director of that month 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 veterinarian and baix llobregat de molins 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.780
 de rei today I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.269
 transport of the cats 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.940
 sometimes it's very difficult to get them out of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.290
 house for it several systems one is 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.270
 the most traditional and the most seen is a 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.580
 carrier the typical carrier 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.890
 classic what always always 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.160
 I would recommend transportation 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.540
 open up because because when 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.850
 you bring us to the vet 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.250
 the cat yes yes we can open it for 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.370
 up the animal is much more relaxed 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 if you are unless you are at home 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.760
 whereas if we have to take it out 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.129
 totally is more unprotected 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.290
 This is one of the means that you indicated 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.089
 also to go by car is also 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.699
 homologated for in airplane although there 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.400
 other sachets there is a nicer plane 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.449
 also approved 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.640
 another more modern way 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.710
 and that is currently carried more to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.700
 transport them we also use it 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.520
 for dogs is this little bag this little bag 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.399
 here before going to put though it's not time 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.460
 to go for the best we reveal the metemos 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.369
 here inside 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.140
 the hook we go to his collar so that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.979
 can not escape this is very 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 important so she can even appear 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.979
 his little head is not going away we close it 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.539
 over here you can see everything that happens to 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.490
 its around and many times we take 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.670
 to take a coffe 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.770
 there are several models of handbags one of the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.899
 problems that we will find is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.040
 when we have to ride the animal in 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.360
 a boat on a plane or in a car 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 for this they will always demand 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.070
 bring approved carriers 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.680
 you have to be very careful and only 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.750
 buy them in specialized stores 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.729
 because if they do not sell you, the carrier is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 that will not do any good and in addition to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.800
 have to pay fines you can be with 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.230
 the German on land 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 also they tell me how you like it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.189
 because he goes for a walk 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.439
 likewise also when you go out with the 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.829
 animal I remind you that you have to carry 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:30.690
 a day the passport with your vaccinations 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:35.810
 and very important your microchip 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.810
 we'll see you another day and thank you very much
