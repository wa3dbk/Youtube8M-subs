00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hi, welcome to the board today. Want to do it? 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 with you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.100
 exercise of plant hormone but 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.010
 before entering into the question itself 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.529
 Let's review the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.100
 major plant hormones 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.150
 good we have oxy- n that is a hormone 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.570
 very important for growth 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.260
 vegetable 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 we also have gibberellins that are 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.839
 hormones that also participate in the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.809
 plant growth process 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:44.129
 they act so much by promoting the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 stretching the cells as increasing 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 the cell division number 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.469
 giberelina 'standing participate in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 The germination of seeds is a cytokine 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.479
 hormone also very important for the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.370
 plant growth 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.320
 we can not forget abscisic acid 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.479
 which is a hormone that unlike the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 others 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.000
 inhibits growth and one to rise 5 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.399
 is also related to dormancy 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.909
 of the seeds and finally the ethylene 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.299
 is a very important gaseous hormone 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.280
 for ripening the fruits and for 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.539
 prove to you that the plant hormone 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.979
 Fall on the enem I brought here an issue 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.530
 of 2010 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 she says that the production of hormones 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 such as the alkali linked to the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.369
 plant growth and its distribution 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.679
 by the body are strongly 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.590
 influenced by environmental factors 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.130
 there are several studies that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.429
 better understand these influences 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 the next experiment integrates one of these 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.030
 studies 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 here we have a figure but before 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.230
 let's move on to the answers 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 Let's explore a little bit this year. 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.569
 started is an issue that speaks 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.870
 on the pool that is connected 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.280
 with plant growth and distribution 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.219
 ucation is strongly influenced by 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 some environmental factors 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:39.469
 we already saw in our lesson 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.469
 that light and also gravity 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.459
 influence the distribution of the workshop and 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:51.120
 thanks to this influence we can 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.230
 talk about two types of growth 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.030
 vegetable 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.359
 the photo the trompista that is a growth 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.689
 influenced by light and hornhop gel 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:06.719
 which is growth in response to 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.769
 gravity and these two growths 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:13.319
 are closely related to the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.049
 distribution of the workshop is here. 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.799
 figure shows a plant that was 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.879
 placed on a rotating stand and this 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.540
 plant has been turning here in this 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.949
 fact that the experiment plant grows 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.400
 in the horizontal rather than vertical direction 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:39.810
 can be explained by the argument that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.979
 turning causes the phosphine was then UCS 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.250
 Let's think here if this plant 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:51.359
 The workshop that is here 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.889
 in the stem would tend to accumulate in this 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.849
 region here 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:04:01.919
 this is because the black office 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:04.979
 here down in favor of gravity 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:09.509
 this is what is accumulated in this 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:14.189
 cells will stretch further and 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:15.239
 this side will grow bigger than the other 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.359
 side 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 and it is this growth that we call 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:26.370
 negative tropism gel because it is 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.849
 against the force of gravity 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.430
 only in the case here of the figure the plant 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.080
 is spinning 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.360
 It's turning the ocz ina will not stay 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.470
 accumulated only in one region 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.000
 it will be evenly distributed 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.630
 along this caulle 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.460
 this is what teaches is not accumulated 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 both this side and this side will 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:02.910
 stretch and the stem will grow here 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.630
 in this horizontal feeling 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.560
 so here in this case the pool will 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.220
 distribute evenly across the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.870
 and stimulating the growth of all 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.260
 they are in exactly the same letter as 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.770
 let's look at the other alternatives 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:29.730
 letter b accumulate on the underside of the bond 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.670
 and therefore determines growth 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.610
 largest of this part 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.010
 not because the workshop will not stay 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.880
 accumulated on the underside 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.620
 it will have a uniform distribution 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:49.320
 because the plant is rotating letters and 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.710
 concentrate on the stem end and 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.490
 this and growth in this part 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.160
 is wrong because the workshop is not 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.910
 concentrated in a region 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.980
 furthermore it does not inhibit the growth 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:11.490
 of stem attention because in the root a high 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.200
 concentration can inhibit the 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.320
 growth because stem and roots 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.790
 have different sensitivities to 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.160
 this hormone 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.990
 only in this matter we are talking about 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:31.950
 stem and stem is stimulated by the ocs 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.580
 distributes one evenly across the 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.300
 The faces of the stem are right and so 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:44.500
 n bar the growth of all of them 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:48.190
 not wrong and concentrate on the face 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.700
 yo of stem and therefore nida activity 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:56.200
 of the lateral gems not like I already said 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:58.480
 the ocz ina is not concentrated then the 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.610
 We closed our staff here with this 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.580
 enem issue 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.480
 any doubt is only to return in our 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.480
 specific classes
