00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
what that is let's say your opponent has

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.770 
what that is let's say your opponent has
a<00:02:16.090> pair<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.390> aces<00:02:17.970> put<00:02:18.970> him<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.300> here<00:02:19.569> he<00:02:19.660> has<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
a pair of aces put him in here he has a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.559 
a pair of aces put him in here he has a
pair<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.080> aces<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.530> you've<00:02:20.620> got<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> hand<00:02:21.220> like

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
pair of aces and you've got a hand like

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.839 
pair of aces and you've got a hand like
eight<00:02:22.569> seven<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.440> Hearts<00:02:23.769> okay<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
eight seven of Hearts okay and then the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.729 
eight seven of Hearts okay and then the
flop<00:02:28.120> comes<00:02:28.150> down<00:02:28.950> King<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.099> Hearts

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
flop comes down King of Hearts

four<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.950> Hearts<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.970> let's<00:02:34.480> say<00:02:35.130> six<00:02:36.130> of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
four of Hearts and let's say six of

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.530 
four of Hearts and let's say six of
Spades<00:02:36.730> okay

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
Spades okay

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170 
Spades okay
so<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:38.530> I'm<00:02:38.650> talking<00:02:39.070> about<00:02:39.610> where

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
so this is what I'm talking about where

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.220 
so this is what I'm talking about where
calculating<00:02:42.180> your<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.930> case

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
calculating your out so in this case

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.380 
calculating your out so in this case
your<00:02:43.650> opponent<00:02:44.010> has<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> pair<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> aces<00:02:44.580> so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
your opponent has a pair of aces so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.920 
your opponent has a pair of aces so
they're<00:02:45.569> beating<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.019> right<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:47.930> your

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
they're beating you right now but your

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.770 
they're beating you right now but your
outs<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.500> what<00:02:49.890> what<00:02:50.099> else<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:51.209> cards<00:02:51.569> can

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
outs are what what else what cards can

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.140 
outs are what what else what cards can
you<00:02:52.050> use<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:53.040> are<00:02:53.250> actually<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.910> make

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you use that are actually going to make

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.030 
you use that are actually going to make
your<00:02:54.599> hand<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.140> winning<00:02:55.530> hand<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.950> actually

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
your hand a winning hand and actually

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.130 
your hand a winning hand and actually
beat<00:02:56.340> these<00:02:56.489> aces<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.630> case<00:02:57.900> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
beat these aces so in this case it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.750 
beat these aces so in this case it's
gonna<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> flush<00:02:58.769> draw<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> hit<00:02:59.610> your

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
gonna be a flush draw so if you hit your

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.670 
gonna be a flush draw so if you hit your
flush<00:03:00.030> which<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.450> five<00:03:00.720> hearts<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.440> case

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
flush which is five hearts in this case

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.949 
flush which is five hearts in this case
then<00:03:02.459> you're<00:03:02.849> actually<00:03:03.209> going<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> be<00:03:03.450> beating

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
then you're actually going to be beating

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.600 
then you're actually going to be beating
this<00:03:04.110> pair<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.410> aces<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.069> how<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.340> count

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
this pair of aces so how do we count

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.570 
this pair of aces so how do we count
that<00:03:05.819> count<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.299> well<00:03:06.510> each<00:03:06.930> suit<00:03:07.410> has<00:03:07.799> 13

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
that count that well each suit has 13

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.410 
that count that well each suit has 13
cards<00:03:08.819> cards<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.810> right<00:03:09.989> everything<00:03:10.709> from

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
cards cards in it right everything from

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.140 
cards cards in it right everything from
two<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> ACE<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.430> there's<00:03:14.580> 13<00:03:14.910> cards

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
two up to the ACE so there's 13 cards

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
two up to the ACE so there's 13 cards
there<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.569> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.440> hearts

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
there so if you have two of the hearts

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
there so if you have two of the hearts
and<00:03:16.890> there's<00:03:17.340> two<00:03:17.549> hearts<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.000> board<00:03:18.360> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
and there's two hearts on board that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.569 
and there's two hearts on board that
means<00:03:19.110> four<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> those<00:03:19.620> hearts<00:03:19.980> are<00:03:20.130> used<00:03:20.340> up

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
means four of those hearts are used up

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.690 
means four of those hearts are used up
there's<00:03:21.180> nine<00:03:21.569> hearts<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.410> take<00:03:22.620> 13<00:03:23.069> minus

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
there's nine hearts you take 13 minus

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.910 
there's nine hearts you take 13 minus
your<00:03:23.849> four<00:03:24.120> there's<00:03:24.720> nine<00:03:25.049> hearts<00:03:25.470> left<00:03:25.739> in

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
your four there's nine hearts left in

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.190 
your four there's nine hearts left in
the<00:03:26.010> deck<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.430> that's<00:03:26.700> your<00:03:27.360> out<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.900> have

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the deck and that's your out so you have

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.890 
the deck and that's your out so you have
nine<00:03:28.650> outs<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.610> situation<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.569> let's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
nine outs in this situation so let's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.690 
nine outs in this situation so let's
look<00:03:31.019> back<00:03:31.200> over<00:03:31.319> here<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.769> mentioned<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.670> a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
look back over here I mentioned on a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.000 
look back over here I mentioned on a
flush<00:03:33.000> draw<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.959> nine<00:03:34.170> outs<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.829> that's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
flush draw you have nine outs so that's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.410 
flush draw you have nine outs so that's
one<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.310> want<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.519> keep<00:03:35.610> it's<00:03:35.880> very<00:03:36.030> easy<00:03:36.269> to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
one you want to keep it's very easy to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
one you want to keep it's very easy to
calculate<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.860> once<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> get<00:03:38.220> more

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
calculate it but once you get more

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
calculate it but once you get more
practice<00:03:38.819> you're<00:03:38.910> gonna<00:03:39.030> find<00:03:39.269> it's<00:03:39.390> very

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
practice you're gonna find it's very

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.910 
practice you're gonna find it's very
very<00:03:39.780> easy<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.380> going<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.590> come<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.890> very

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
very easy it's going to come to you very

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.220 
very easy it's going to come to you very
very<00:03:41.099> naturally<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:42.989> sort<00:03:43.170> of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
very naturally but you just sort of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.229 
very naturally but you just sort of
count<00:03:43.440> how<00:03:43.829> many<00:03:43.890> cards<00:03:44.340> are<00:03:44.549> left<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
count how many cards are left in the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.699 
count how many cards are left in the
deck<00:03:45.389> that<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.690> need<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.230> let's<00:03:46.440> look<00:03:46.590> at

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
deck that you need so let's look at

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.229 
deck that you need so let's look at
another<00:03:46.920> scenario<00:03:47.160> let's<00:03:47.639> go<00:03:47.730> back<00:03:47.940> over<00:03:47.970> here

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
another scenario let's go back over here

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.610 
another scenario let's go back over here
we're<00:03:48.480> gonna<00:03:48.569> look<00:03:48.720> at<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> straight<00:03:49.170> draw<00:03:49.380> now

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
we're gonna look at a straight draw now

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.949 
we're gonna look at a straight draw now
so<00:03:50.280> let's<00:03:50.459> say<00:03:50.639> this<00:03:51.060> wasn't<00:03:51.299> really<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.630> flush

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
so let's say this wasn't really a flush

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.949 
so let's say this wasn't really a flush
opportunity<00:03:52.739> over<00:03:52.889> here<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.540> instead<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.870> had

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
opportunity over here but instead we had

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.569 
opportunity over here but instead we had
the<00:03:55.079> eight<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> clubs<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.180> then<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:58.459> we<00:03:59.459> can

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
the eight of clubs and then this we can

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.830 
the eight of clubs and then this we can
keep<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.850> King<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.120> Hearts<00:04:00.269> that's<00:04:00.569> fine

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
keep the King of Hearts that's fine

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.750 
keep the King of Hearts that's fine
let's<00:04:01.079> get<00:04:01.170> rid<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.560> four<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.130> hearts<00:04:02.519> and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
let's get rid of this four of hearts and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.330 
let's get rid of this four of hearts and
let's<00:04:02.910> put<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.410> we've<00:04:04.410> got<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> six<00:04:04.950> already

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
let's put in we've got the six already

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.309 
let's put in we've got the six already
let's<00:04:05.670> put<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> nine<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.180> diamonds<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:07.079> here

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
let's put the nine of diamonds in here

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.920 
let's put the nine of diamonds in here
okay<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:08.970> gonna<00:04:09.090> show<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:09.420> scenario

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
okay and this is gonna show a scenario

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.479 
okay and this is gonna show a scenario
here<00:04:10.200> where<00:04:10.350> you've<00:04:10.440> got<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.680> sit<00:04:11.130> right<00:04:11.310> now

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
here where you've got a sit right now

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.729 
here where you've got a sit right now
the<00:04:11.760> pair<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.000> aces<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.510> ahead<00:04:12.810> but<00:04:13.410> you've<00:04:13.530> got

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
the pair of aces is ahead but you've got

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.000 
the pair of aces is ahead but you've got
six<00:04:14.280> seven<00:04:15.150> eight<00:04:15.299> nine<00:04:15.870> meaning<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.859> you've

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
six seven eight nine meaning that you've

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.680 
six seven eight nine meaning that you've
got<00:04:17.250> an<00:04:17.370> up-and-down<00:04:17.760> straight<00:04:18.239> draw<00:04:18.450> so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
got an up-and-down straight draw so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.170 
got an up-and-down straight draw so
you're<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.049> you're<00:04:19.739> drawing<00:04:20.609> out<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.820> straight

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
you're you you're drawing out a straight

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.000 
you're you you're drawing out a straight
so<00:04:21.389> how<00:04:21.539> many<00:04:21.690> outs<00:04:21.870> else<00:04:22.200> do<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.440> have<00:04:22.620> well

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
so how many outs else do you have well

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.670 
so how many outs else do you have well
you<00:04:23.250> need<00:04:23.580> any<00:04:23.849> five<00:04:24.380> because<00:04:25.380> then<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.590> would

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
you need any five because then it would

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.760 
you need any five because then it would
go<00:04:25.800> five<00:04:26.099> six<00:04:26.130> seven<00:04:27.030> eight<00:04:27.180> nine<00:04:27.450> or<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.840> ten

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
go five six seven eight nine or a ten

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.830 
go five six seven eight nine or a ten
where<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.610> would<00:04:29.700> go<00:04:29.820> six<00:04:30.150> seven<00:04:30.479> eight<00:04:30.660> nine

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
where it would go six seven eight nine

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450 
where it would go six seven eight nine
ten<00:04:31.200> for<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.500> straight<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.919> need<00:04:32.099> there's

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
ten for the straight so you need there's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.790 
ten for the straight so you need there's
we<00:04:32.789> know<00:04:32.910> there's<00:04:33.120> four<00:04:33.389> fives<00:04:33.750> left<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.380> we

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
we know there's four fives left and we

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.770 
we know there's four fives left and we
know<00:04:34.889> there's<00:04:35.099> four<00:04:35.340> tens<00:04:35.700> left<00:04:36.030> which<00:04:36.570> makes

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
know there's four tens left which makes

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.140 
know there's four tens left which makes
a<00:04:36.900> total<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.289> eight<00:04:37.560> outs<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.880> look<00:04:39.030> at

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
a total of eight outs so if you look at

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.190 
a total of eight outs so if you look at
the<00:04:39.210> other<00:04:39.330> thing<00:04:39.479> over<00:04:39.690> here<00:04:39.720> whenever

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the other thing over here whenever

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.379 
the other thing over here whenever
you're<00:04:40.470> on<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> straight<00:04:40.979> draw<00:04:41.250> your<00:04:41.820> outs<00:04:42.090> are

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
you're on a straight draw your outs are

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.570 
you're on a straight draw your outs are
eight<00:04:42.660> okay<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:43.530> now<00:04:44.099> let's<00:04:44.310> look<00:04:44.430> at<00:04:44.550> a

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
eight okay so now let's look at a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.040 
eight okay so now let's look at a
scenario<00:04:44.760> let's<00:04:45.419> even<00:04:45.570> look<00:04:45.720> at<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.900> one

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
scenario let's even look at this one

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.370 
scenario let's even look at this one
here

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
here

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.350 
here
where<00:04:46.710> you've<00:04:46.889> got<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.070> straight<00:04:47.460> draw<00:04:47.789> but

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
where you've got a straight draw but

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 
where you've got a straight draw but
plus<00:04:48.630> two<00:04:48.930> over<00:04:49.200> cards<00:04:49.710> okay<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.280> that's

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
plus two over cards okay so that's

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.740 
plus two over cards okay so that's
that's<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.940> bit<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.240> difference<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.630> can

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
that's a bit of a difference you can

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.980 
that's a bit of a difference you can
calculate<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.200> can<00:04:52.320> count<00:04:52.530> your<00:04:52.590> out

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
calculate you can count your out

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.310 
calculate you can count your out
in<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.560> situation<00:04:53.770> here<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:55.080> head<00:04:56.080> let's

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
in that situation here so head let's

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.740 
in that situation here so head let's
head<00:04:56.440> back<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.860> thing<00:04:57.040> here<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.480> let's<00:04:58.630> see

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
head back to the thing here so let's see

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.540 
head back to the thing here so let's see
it<00:04:58.840> wanted<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.320> straight<00:04:59.680> draw<00:04:59.980> we<00:05:00.340> already

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
it wanted a straight draw we already

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.680 
it wanted a straight draw we already
have<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.760> straight<00:05:00.970> draw<00:05:01.150> here<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.510> let's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
have the straight draw here so let's

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.820 
have the straight draw here so let's
make<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:02.050> pair<00:05:02.440> something<00:05:03.190> like<00:05:04.680> let's<00:05:05.680> do<00:05:05.770> a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
make this pair something like let's do a

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.630 
make this pair something like let's do a
pair<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.100> threes<00:05:07.020> okay<00:05:08.020> so<00:05:08.470> now<00:05:08.680> what<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.610> have

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
pair of threes okay so now what you have

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.820 
pair of threes okay so now what you have
is<00:05:10.120> your<00:05:10.390> straight<00:05:10.750> draw<00:05:10.990> which<00:05:11.350> we<00:05:11.680> already

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
is your straight draw which we already

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.490 
is your straight draw which we already
know<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.220> eight<00:05:12.460> outs<00:05:12.700> right<00:05:13.300> any<00:05:13.570> five<00:05:13.900> any<00:05:14.350> of

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
know is eight outs right any five any of

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.250 
know is eight outs right any five any of
the<00:05:14.590> four<00:05:14.770> fives<00:05:15.040> any<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.610> four<00:05:15.820> tens<00:05:16.260> but

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
the four fives any of the four tens but

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.890 
the four fives any of the four tens but
now<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:18.100> have<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.460> opportunity<00:05:18.760> to<00:05:19.420> hit<00:05:19.630> any

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
now you have the opportunity to hit any

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.750 
now you have the opportunity to hit any
of<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.380> eight<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:21.100> are<00:05:21.220> left<00:05:21.400> in<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.610> deck

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
of the eight that are left in the deck

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.310 
of the eight that are left in the deck
and<00:05:22.030> any<00:05:22.240> of<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.510> sevens<00:05:22.840> because<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.200> will

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
and any of the sevens because that will

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.570 
and any of the sevens because that will
give<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.560> pair<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.920> eights<00:05:24.100> which<00:05:24.340> would<00:05:24.490> be

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
give you a pair of eights which would be

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.820 
give you a pair of eights which would be
a<00:05:24.610> head<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.820> this<00:05:24.970> these<00:05:25.600> threes<00:05:25.960> or<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.500> pair<00:05:26.800> of

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
a head of this these threes or a pair of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.140 
a head of this these threes or a pair of
sevens<00:05:27.280> which<00:05:27.580> would<00:05:27.700> be<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.820> head<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.000> these

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
sevens which would be a head of these

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.300 
sevens which would be a head of these
threes<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:28.690> you<00:05:29.200> calculate<00:05:29.380> your<00:05:29.800> eight<00:05:30.040> from

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
threes so you calculate your eight from

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.890 
threes so you calculate your eight from
the<00:05:30.400> straight<00:05:30.640> draw<00:05:30.850> plus<00:05:31.150> your<00:05:31.330> two<00:05:31.510> overs

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
the straight draw plus your two overs

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.330 
the straight draw plus your two overs
which<00:05:32.140> would<00:05:32.320> be<00:05:32.440> there's<00:05:32.620> three<00:05:32.890> more<00:05:33.040> eights

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
which would be there's three more eights

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.400 
which would be there's three more eights
in<00:05:33.580> here<00:05:33.760> and<00:05:33.940> there's<00:05:34.120> three<00:05:34.540> more<00:05:34.810> sevens

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
in here and there's three more sevens

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.230 
in here and there's three more sevens
that<00:05:35.590> are<00:05:35.680> available<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.580> could<00:05:36.820> possibly

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
that are available that could possibly

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.480 
that are available that could possibly
come<00:05:37.480> out<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.290> you<00:05:38.350> take<00:05:38.560> your<00:05:38.590> three<00:05:39.280> plus

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
come out so you take your three plus

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.910 
come out so you take your three plus
three<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.790> six<00:05:39.940> add<00:05:40.480> them<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.170> your<00:05:41.200> eight<00:05:41.620> outs

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
three is six add them to your eight outs

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
three is six add them to your eight outs
for<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.370> straight<00:05:42.640> you've<00:05:42.910> got<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.420> total<00:05:44.020> of

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
for the straight you've got a total of

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.690 
for the straight you've got a total of
14<00:05:46.380> in<00:05:47.380> this<00:05:47.860> case<00:05:48.010> it's<00:05:48.160> going<00:05:48.250> to<00:05:48.310> be<00:05:48.370> six

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
14 in this case it's going to be six

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.840 
14 in this case it's going to be six
plus<00:05:48.850> eight<00:05:49.120> fourteen<00:05:49.870> outs<00:05:50.050> here<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.850> we

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
plus eight fourteen outs here and we

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.640 
plus eight fourteen outs here and we
looked<00:05:52.030> here<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:52.780> actually<00:05:53.020> this<00:05:53.440> should<00:05:53.560> be

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
looked here it's actually this should be

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.620 
looked here it's actually this should be
14<00:05:54.070> not<00:05:54.250> 50<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:54.700> I<00:05:54.760> think<00:05:54.970> I<00:05:55.060> was<00:05:55.180> doing<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.510> on

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
14 not 50 and I think I was doing it on

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.720 
14 not 50 and I think I was doing it on
a<00:05:55.690> flush<00:05:56.020> draw<00:05:56.050> which<00:05:56.560> was<00:05:56.740> nine<00:05:56.980> plus<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.520> six

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
a flush draw which was nine plus the six

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.490 
a flush draw which was nine plus the six
because<00:05:57.910> on<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.030> on<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.450> flush<00:05:58.810> draw<00:05:58.840> plus<00:05:59.350> the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
because on a on a flush draw plus the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.460 
because on a on a flush draw plus the
two<00:05:59.680> overs<00:06:00.130> would<00:06:00.760> be<00:06:00.990> 15<00:06:01.990> out<00:06:02.140> so<00:06:02.350> you're

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
two overs would be 15 out so you're

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.110 
two overs would be 15 out so you're
actually<00:06:02.560> getting<00:06:02.770> 14<00:06:03.370> outs<00:06:03.550> on<00:06:03.790> a<00:06:03.820> straight

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
actually getting 14 outs on a straight

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.820 
actually getting 14 outs on a straight
draw<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:04.570> you<00:06:04.630> can<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.200> can<00:06:05.320> see<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.620> there

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
draw so you can you can see that there

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.220 
draw so you can you can see that there
so<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.400> flush<00:06:06.790> draw<00:06:06.820> with<00:06:07.270> one<00:06:07.570> over<00:06:07.930> is<00:06:08.050> gonna

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
so a flush draw with one over is gonna

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.980 
so a flush draw with one over is gonna
be<00:06:08.350> the<00:06:08.440> nine<00:06:08.650> outs<00:06:08.920> plus<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.760> three<00:06:10.450> overs<00:06:10.780> on

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
be the nine outs plus the three overs on

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.750 
be the nine outs plus the three overs on
that<00:06:11.200> card<00:06:11.470> which<00:06:11.620> would<00:06:11.770> be<00:06:11.950> 12<00:06:12.220> outs<00:06:12.490> and

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
that card which would be 12 outs and

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.580 
that card which would be 12 outs and
then<00:06:13.390> if<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.600> have<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.810> straight<00:06:14.320> flush<00:06:14.770> draw

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
then if you have a straight flush draw

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.350 
then if you have a straight flush draw
you<00:06:17.590> know<00:06:17.710> where<00:06:18.280> you're<00:06:18.370> actually<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:19.240> have

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
you know where you're actually you have

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.180 
you know where you're actually you have
an<00:06:19.450> up-and-down<00:06:19.810> straight<00:06:20.230> and<00:06:20.410> a<00:06:20.830> flush<00:06:21.160> draw

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
an up-and-down straight and a flush draw

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.310 
an up-and-down straight and a flush draw
potential<00:06:21.940> you<00:06:22.090> actually<00:06:22.510> have<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.690> total<00:06:23.110> of

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
potential you actually have a total of

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.050 
potential you actually have a total of
17<00:06:24.250> outs<00:06:24.670> there<00:06:25.240> so<00:06:26.490> these<00:06:27.490> are<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.700> one<00:06:27.850> main

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
17 outs there so these are the one main

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.340 
17 outs there so these are the one main
ones<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.390> want<00:06:28.540> to<00:06:28.630> do<00:06:28.720> it's<00:06:28.870> very<00:06:28.900> easy

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
ones you want to do it's very easy

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.480 
ones you want to do it's very easy
especially<00:06:29.530> at<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.890> beginning<00:06:30.160> you<00:06:30.220> can<00:06:30.340> just

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
especially at the beginning you can just

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.430 
especially at the beginning you can just
calculate<00:06:30.760> you<00:06:31.240> just<00:06:31.390> count<00:06:31.660> out<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:31.960> cards

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
calculate you just count out the cards

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.170 
calculate you just count out the cards
that<00:06:32.560> would<00:06:32.710> actually<00:06:32.980> help<00:06:33.160> you<00:06:33.430> and<00:06:33.670> then

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
that would actually help you and then

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.210 
that would actually help you and then
with<00:06:34.420> practice<00:06:34.930> you'll<00:06:35.080> find<00:06:35.380> that<00:06:35.560> you<00:06:35.980> you

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
with practice you'll find that you you

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.680 
with practice you'll find that you you
just<00:06:36.400> know<00:06:36.520> flush<00:06:36.880> draw<00:06:37.060> means<00:06:37.300> nine<00:06:37.450> outs

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
just know flush draw means nine outs

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.780 
just know flush draw means nine outs
straight<00:06:38.020> draw<00:06:38.200> means<00:06:38.440> you<00:06:39.250> know<00:06:39.340> eight<00:06:39.580> outs

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
straight draw means you know eight outs

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.940 
straight draw means you know eight outs
flush<00:06:40.480> draw<00:06:40.690> with<00:06:40.900> one<00:06:41.110> over<00:06:41.380> card<00:06:41.620> we<00:06:41.770> know

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
flush draw with one over card we know

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.050 
flush draw with one over card we know
it's<00:06:42.100> twelve<00:06:42.370> outs<00:06:42.580> you're<00:06:42.760> gonna<00:06:42.880> you're

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
it's twelve outs you're gonna you're

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.190 
it's twelve outs you're gonna you're
gonna<00:06:43.120> get<00:06:43.330> so<00:06:43.540> you're<00:06:43.630> gonna<00:06:43.720> try<00:06:43.900> to<00:06:43.990> keep

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
gonna get so you're gonna try to keep

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.420 
gonna get so you're gonna try to keep
these<00:06:44.440> to<00:06:44.590> memory<00:06:44.890> because<00:06:44.980> these<00:06:45.190> are<00:06:45.340> the

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
these to memory because these are the

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.300 
these to memory because these are the
main<00:06:45.670> ones<00:06:45.850> that<00:06:46.180> you're<00:06:46.270> gonna<00:06:46.420> want<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.780> be

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
main ones that you're gonna want to be

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.450 
main ones that you're gonna want to be
focused<00:06:48.310> on<00:06:48.400> there<00:06:48.640> so<00:06:49.800> so<00:06:50.800> that's<00:06:50.980> it<00:06:51.190> there

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
focused on there so so that's it there

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.420 
focused on there so so that's it there
let's<00:06:51.760> look<00:06:51.940> at<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.210> homework<00:06:52.630> for<00:06:52.660> today

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
let's look at the homework for today

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.010 
let's look at the homework for today
basically<00:06:54.430> practice<00:06:55.030> counting<00:06:55.330> your<00:06:55.480> outs<00:06:55.630> so

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
basically practice counting your outs so

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.210 
basically practice counting your outs so

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
you can do that you can go over to card

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.200 
you can do that you can go over to card
player<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:57.670> run<00:06:57.850> through<00:06:58.000> different

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
player and run through different

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.350 
player and run through different
scenarios<00:06:58.590> through<00:06:59.590> the<00:07:00.210> through<00:07:01.210> their

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
scenarios through the through their

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.710 
scenarios through the through their
little<00:07:01.570> little<00:07:01.960> calculator<00:07:02.800> tool<00:07:03.070> there<00:07:03.280> and

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
little little calculator tool there and

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.030 
little little calculator tool there and
just<00:07:04.720> you<00:07:04.960> want<00:07:05.110> to<00:07:05.170> try<00:07:05.260> to<00:07:05.320> keep<00:07:05.470> those<00:07:05.710> ones

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
just you want to try to keep those ones

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.780 
just you want to try to keep those ones
to<00:07:06.220> memory<00:07:06.520> if

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
to memory if

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.310 
to memory if
because<00:07:07.360> they're<00:07:07.540> the<00:07:07.690> most<00:07:07.840> common<00:07:08.170> ones

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
because they're the most common ones

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.240 
because they're the most common ones
they're<00:07:08.440> gonna<00:07:08.530> come<00:07:08.710> out<00:07:08.800> but<00:07:08.920> you'll<00:07:09.070> see
