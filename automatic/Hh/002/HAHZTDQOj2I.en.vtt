have that piece of paper saying you got
a<00:00:56.550> degree<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.559> thought<00:00:58.829> well<00:00:59.160> I'll<00:00:59.520> just

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
a degree so I thought well I'll just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
a degree so I thought well I'll just
have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> soldier<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.469> all

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
have to soldier on and put up with all

probably<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.979> Gaia<00:01:05.640> theory<00:01:06.030> how's<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
probably for Gaia theory how's that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
probably for Gaia theory how's that
changed<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.650> mind<00:01:07.860> over<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> past
