00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 So here we are here at Orange de Colo 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.240
 which is therefore a cattle breeding society 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.780
 installed in the lower congo 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.059
 so for over 80 years here we do 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 extensive breeding on its valve 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.350
 natural ram 6 6 totals between 22 and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 25 thousand head of cattle that are 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 raised on a total concession that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 makes fifty thousand hectares so the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.430
 average is about two hectares 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.840
 per animal on the natural course by 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.410
 against on pastures here more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.910
 intensive we can go up to 5 bet at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 the hectare which is actually ten times 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.309
 more support the animal good it's a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.160
 activity that is subject to different 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 constraints 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.559
 the first one we actually mean it was 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 a little permanent conflicts that one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.809
 a little with the wants not to say the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 population finally the direct environment 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.189
 of the reign since we must know that we have 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 firstly poaching problems 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.280
 almost permanent all year so 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 poaching mainly at the level of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 livestock but also at the level of our 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.909
 infrastructure the fences too so 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 that's a little a brake to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.229
 development and that's according to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.549
 these aspects the con we choose our nos 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.200
 choice and our development policies 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.970
 and this is why we 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 actually decides here since a few 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.049
 years of focusing a little bit 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 more and use more pastures 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 intensive like the robber who 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 allow cattle to be brought back from the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.700
 better control it actually in addition to the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.500
 makes it better for the domestic 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.610
 and not calmer cattle like you 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 see here only at the ecological level 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.170
 there is a first aspect it is the foam 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.119
 ttc which is a well known vector of the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.950
 trypanosomiasis which is a disease that 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 raging tropical romantics called the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 sleeping sickness including trypanosome 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.430
 in fact is transmitted by the fly 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.920
 tsetse that is relatively present 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.220
 here in the middle not so much finally 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.950
 she was here and it's one of 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.040
 that's one of the reasons we have 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.360
 chose a breed of cattle that is 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.200
 tolerant to this tribune so we are at 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.620
 this illness 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 if I can say this is the first 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 first aspect a little ecological 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.390
 if I can say and then there is a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.519
 second aspect that's important it's 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.670
 development here since a 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.319
 fifteen years of an invasive plant 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.610
 what are called rejects the rise is 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.550
 his vernacular name 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.890
 it is a plant that is very invasive 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.270
 is very aggressive actually 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.770
 mainly on the sites of 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.760
 two cattle gatherings and on 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.020
 watering sites along the slopes 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 and so it's a plant that creates us 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.820
 a lot of problems because it is 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.180
 spread very quickly and she answer each other 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.930
 in the places that embarrass us the most 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.620
 mainly because his doctor 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.210
 sowing and dissemination methods 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.480
 that is done by the wind and the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.160
 contact with the animals and there we have 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.600
 a lot of problems actually since 15 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.490
 years here we have now set up 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.740
 outright so a fight service 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.460
 against the eire of laos 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.840
 so that means we have a whole 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.200
 team and a whole budget that works 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.970
 there permanently 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.310
 so that costs a lot of money and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.420
 it's something that is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.710
 a must for us, although we 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.940
 will never reach the end we will not arrive 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.540
 never to eradicate this plant that 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.070
 now has colonized maybe I can 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.600
 say from two to three thousand hectares on 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.120
 the concession of 50 thousand hectares are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.900
 colonized now by this 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.330
 plant is ecologically it's a big 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.700
 imbalance in our grazing in 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.940
 our way of working with the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.940
 livestock
