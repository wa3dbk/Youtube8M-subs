00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.820 

the<00:02:22.069> hardware<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.690> 3gs<00:02:24.690> who<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.739> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the hardware on the 3gs who is going to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.820 
the hardware on the 3gs who is going to
have<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> new<00:02:26.520> compass<00:02:27.410> billing<00:02:28.410> compass

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
have a new compass billing compass

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.780 
have a new compass billing compass
application<00:02:31.670> second<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:34.260> better<00:02:34.709> camera<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
application second is a better camera so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.870 
application second is a better camera so
I<00:02:36.180> don't<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.050> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.319> be<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.880> new

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
I don't think it's going to be a new

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.449 
I don't think it's going to be a new
megapixel<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.770> think<00:02:41.100> you're<00:02:41.190> still<00:02:41.370> gonna

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
megapixel so I think you're still gonna

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.690 
megapixel so I think you're still gonna
have<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.670> 2<00:02:41.790> megapixel<00:02:41.910> camera<00:02:43.100> but<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.280> does

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
have a 2 megapixel camera but it does

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.890 
have a 2 megapixel camera but it does
include<00:02:45.110> autofocus<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:47.150> white<00:02:48.150> balance<00:02:48.569> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
include autofocus and white balance and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
include autofocus and white balance and
all<00:02:49.290> sorts<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.760> professional<00:02:50.760> camera

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
all sorts of professional camera
