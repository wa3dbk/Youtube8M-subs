00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
bad thing like just maybe that won't be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.180 
bad thing like just maybe that won't be
a<00:00:48.329> bad<00:00:48.570> thing<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.050> I've<00:00:49.350> been<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.160> know

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
living room and then I really took a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.260 
living room and then I really took a
leap<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.270> faith<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.369> really<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
leap of faith and really you know it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
leap of faith and really you know it
became<00:01:45.689> bigger<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.680> could

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
became bigger and I could

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.030 
became bigger and I could
see<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.270> market<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.020> market<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
see that there was a market a market and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.360 
see that there was a market a market and
so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> wrote<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> business<00:01:51.150> plan<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:53.070> raised

manufacturing plant
you<00:02:16.500> know<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.550> other<00:02:17.760> people<00:02:18.090> did<00:02:18.330> you

other<00:02:20.340> people<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.360> couldn't<00:02:21.720> be

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
other people do this this couldn't be

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.199 
other people do this this couldn't be
that<00:02:21.900> hard<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.739> mean<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> can't<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.610> if

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
that hard and I mean I can't do it if

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.400 
that hard and I mean I can't do it if

there's something that you believe
strongly<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.030> keeps<00:02:27.300> coming<00:02:27.690> back<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
strongly in and it keeps coming back to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
strongly in and it keeps coming back to
you<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:29.160> that's<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.269> keys

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
you like that's that's one of the keys

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.840 
you like that's that's one of the keys
is<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.500> idea<00:02:31.709> kept<00:02:32.100> coming<00:02:32.459> back<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.640> me

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
is like this idea kept coming back to me

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.160 
is like this idea kept coming back to me
it<00:02:33.000> wasn't<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.360> something<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> thought<00:02:34.050> of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it wasn't like something I thought of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.750 
it wasn't like something I thought of
one<00:02:34.380> week<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.040> never<00:02:35.250> thought<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.640> again

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
one week and then never thought of again

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.120 
one week and then never thought of again
like<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.630> kept<00:02:36.840> coming<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.470> kept<00:02:37.739> coming

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
like it kept coming back it kept coming

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.740 
like it kept coming back it kept coming
back<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.640> I've<00:02:38.730> got<00:02:38.850> other<00:02:39.030> ideas<00:02:39.209> that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
back because I've got other ideas that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.390 
back because I've got other ideas that
you<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.170> next<00:02:40.680> month<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.070> don't<00:02:41.250> think

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
you know then next month you don't think

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.979 
you know then next month you don't think
about<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.700> again<00:02:41.790> right<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.780> keeps

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
about it again right but if it keeps

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.020 
about it again right but if it keeps
coming<00:02:43.440> back<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.400> feel<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
coming back to you and you feel like you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.880 
coming back to you and you feel like you
have<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.170> right<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.209> would<00:02:48.720> say<00:02:49.019> if

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
have to do it right then I would say if

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.300 
have to do it right then I would say if
you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.280> possibly<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> before<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.380> say

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you can possibly do it before you say

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610 
you can possibly do it before you say
quit<00:02:53.700> your<00:02:54.030> other<00:02:54.180> job<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.959> could<00:02:55.140> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
quit your other job if you could you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
quit your other job if you could you
know<00:02:55.680> start<00:02:55.799> taking<00:02:56.340> some<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> steps<00:02:57.180> like

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
know start taking some of the steps like

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.229 
know start taking some of the steps like
for<00:02:58.290> example<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:59.459> know<00:02:59.579> see<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.090> can

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
for example you know see if you can

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.080 
for example you know see if you can
start<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.630> little<00:03:00.810> test<00:03:01.140> market<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.640> test

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
start a little test market like a test

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.210 
start a little test market like a test
market<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> an<00:03:03.840> important<00:03:04.350> piece<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.769> even

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
market is an important piece of it even

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.090 
market is an important piece of it even
before<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.700> write<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.420> business<00:03:06.690> plan

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
before you write the business plan

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.560 
before you write the business plan
because<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.340> test<00:03:08.670> market<00:03:08.880> proves<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
because a test market proves that a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.660 
because a test market proves that a
concept<00:03:10.079> could<00:03:10.440> potentially<00:03:11.040> work<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
concept could potentially work and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.420 
concept could potentially work and
that's<00:03:12.180> really<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:13.230> helpful<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:14.160> even<00:03:14.370> a

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that's really really helpful for even a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.940 
that's really really helpful for even a
business<00:03:14.730> plan<00:03:14.970> which<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.810> necessary<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.769> get

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
business plan which is necessary to get

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.610 
business plan which is necessary to get
the<00:03:17.220> SBA<00:03:17.670> loan<00:03:18.030> which<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.720> necessary<00:03:19.320> really

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
the SBA loan which is necessary really

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.949 
the SBA loan which is necessary really
to<00:03:19.920> do<00:03:20.070> anything<00:03:20.610> because<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.299> need<00:03:21.480> capital

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to do anything because you need capital

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.990 
to do anything because you need capital
really<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.160> do<00:03:23.310> anything<00:03:26.000> well

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
really to do anything well
