thing<00:00:31.859> takes<00:00:32.099> place<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.969> seed<00:00:33.390> series<00:00:34.370> me

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
thing takes place in the seed series me

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940 
thing takes place in the seed series me
see<00:00:35.579> Gundam<00:00:36.030> Seed<00:00:36.239> universe<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.440> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
see Gundam Seed universe but it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
see Gundam Seed universe but it's
actually<00:00:38.550> from<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.820> manga<00:00:40.550> only<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.910> that's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
actually from a manga only so that's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
actually from a manga only so that's
probably<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.200> many<00:00:43.469> people<00:00:43.770> might<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.160> know

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
probably why many people might not know

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.170 
probably why many people might not know

of this kit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
of this kit
I<00:00:49.710> built<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.520> few<00:00:50.730> years<00:00:50.879> ago<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I built this a few years ago but at the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
I built this a few years ago but at the
time<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.920> had<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:55.430> pretty<00:00:56.430> low

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
time I had a you know a pretty low

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
time I had a you know a pretty low
quality<00:00:56.850> camera<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.500> also<00:00:59.399> used<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:01.590> know

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
quality camera and I also used you know

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.149 
quality camera and I also used you know
some<00:01:02.010> musics<00:01:02.600> since<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.840> obviously<00:01:04.159> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
some musics since then obviously I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
some musics since then obviously I
became<00:01:05.760> partners<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> can't<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> know

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
became partners so I can't you know

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
became partners so I can't you know
can't<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.710> music<00:01:11.250> playing<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
can't really have music playing on the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450 
can't really have music playing on the
background<00:01:12.380> more<00:01:13.380> than<00:01:13.560> 30<00:01:13.740> seconds<00:01:14.220> that's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
background more than 30 seconds that's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.039 
background more than 30 seconds that's
not<00:01:14.670> mine<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> decided<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> basically

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
not mine so I decided to basically

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
not mine so I decided to basically
reupload<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> video<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.580> go<00:01:23.479> yep

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
reupload this video so here we go yep

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
reupload this video so here we go yep
and<00:01:26.299> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> better<00:01:27.600> lighting<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> should

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and with the better lighting you should

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
and with the better lighting you should
be<00:01:29.430> able<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.909> better<00:01:30.150> detail<00:01:31.250> well

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
be able to see better detail well

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.840 
be able to see better detail well
basically<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> straight<00:01:33.869> build<00:01:34.850> clean

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
basically I did a straight build clean

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
basically I did a straight build clean
pretty<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.990> knob<00:01:37.200> marks<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:39.500> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
pretty much all the knob marks and I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
pretty much all the knob marks and I
actually<00:01:41.460> did<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.299> apply<00:01:42.630> any<00:01:43.020> flat<00:01:43.590> coat<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
actually did not apply any flat coat the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.670 
actually did not apply any flat coat the
reason<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> might<00:01:45.299> look<00:01:46.939> flat<00:01:47.939> finish<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:49.290> due

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
reason it might look flat finish is due

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.510 
reason it might look flat finish is due
to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.820> fact<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.890> at<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> time<00:01:53.130> when<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to the fact that at the time when I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.560 
to the fact that at the time when I
built<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.180> did<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.290> flat<00:01:55.860> coat

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
built this I did not know that flat coat

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.740 
built this I did not know that flat coat
even<00:01:57.570> existed<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> world<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> actually

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
even existed in the world so I actually

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.160 
even existed in the world so I actually
went<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.820> literally<00:02:02.820> sanded<00:02:03.420> each<00:02:03.630> piece

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
went out and literally sanded each piece

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.060 
went out and literally sanded each piece
by

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
by

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.150 
by
cheese<00:02:05.220> with<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.940> sponge<00:02:07.520> sandpaper<00:02:09.740> yup

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
