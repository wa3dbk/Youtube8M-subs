clock

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
clock

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.580 
clock
I<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> ticking<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.660> time<00:02:28.900> bomb<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
I think of the ticking of a time bomb a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
I think of the ticking of a time bomb a
clock<00:02:30.490> motif<00:02:30.940> which<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.570> spread<00:02:31.900> throughout

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
clock motif which is spread throughout

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990 
clock motif which is spread throughout
the<00:02:32.320> game<00:02:32.500> you'd<00:02:33.310> be<00:02:33.430> interested<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.970> know

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the game you'd be interested to know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.230 
the game you'd be interested to know
then<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.020> have<00:02:35.110> twelve<00:02:35.380> levels<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:37.120> each

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
then we have twelve levels one for each

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.710 
then we have twelve levels one for each
hand<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.810> clock<00:02:38.340> uh-huh<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.600> was<00:02:40.690> a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
hand on the clock uh-huh so that was a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.060 
hand on the clock uh-huh so that was a
very<00:02:40.900> clever<00:02:41.110> thing<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.500> actually<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:42.040> a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
very clever thing that I actually is a

let's<00:02:48.400> say<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.580> want<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> draft<00:02:49.240> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
let's say you want to be a draft you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.060 
let's say you want to be a draft you
can't<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.380> because<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.740> don't<00:02:50.860> have

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
can't do that because we don't have

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.940 
can't do that because we don't have
animals<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:51.670> our<00:02:51.760> game<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:53.260> could<00:02:53.500> in

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
animals in our game but you could in

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.280 
animals in our game but you could in
theory<00:02:54.250> if<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:55.030> wanted<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:55.990> we're<00:02:56.140> not

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
theory if you wanted to but we're not

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.230 
theory if you wanted to but we're not
allowing<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.100> players<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.610> really<00:02:57.760> choose

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
allowing the players to really choose

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.680 
allowing the players to really choose
their<00:02:58.630> own<00:02:58.660> destiny<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.210> do<00:03:01.330> is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
their own destiny what we like to do is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.270 
their own destiny what we like to do is
control<00:03:02.260> everything<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> bassist<00:03:04.210> regime

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
control everything like a bassist regime

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.280 
control everything like a bassist regime
and<00:03:06.280> that's<00:03:07.180> really<00:03:07.360> what<00:03:07.600> players<00:03:07.810> wants<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
and that's really what players wants to

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.650 
and that's really what players wants to
be<00:03:08.380> told<00:03:08.560> what<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.800> do<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.190> how<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.370> do<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.760> if

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
be told what to do with how to do it if

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.760 
be told what to do with how to do it if
these<00:03:11.700> sandbox<00:03:12.700> games<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.780> say<00:03:13.989> they

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
these sandbox games I have to say they

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.100 
these sandbox games I have to say they
call<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.130> it's<00:03:15.610> too<00:03:15.760> much<00:03:15.910> freedom<00:03:16.150> when

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
call them it's too much freedom when

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.140 
call them it's too much freedom when
when<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.100> too<00:03:18.280> much<00:03:18.400> freedom<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:19.120> have

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
when you have too much freedom you have

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.380 
when you have too much freedom you have
a<00:03:19.750> couple<00:03:20.350> or<00:03:20.500> gameplay<00:03:20.830> experience<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.790> the

a couple or gameplay experience and the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.850 
a couple or gameplay experience and the
design<00:03:22.600> boring<00:03:22.870> factor<00:03:23.170> not<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.410> get<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> poor

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
design boring factor not to get a poor

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.770 
design boring factor not to get a poor
gameplay<00:03:24.100> experience<00:03:24.820> you're<00:03:25.330> gonna<00:03:25.450> get<00:03:25.570> one

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
gameplay experience you're gonna get one

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.020 
gameplay experience you're gonna get one
that<00:03:25.989> costs<00:03:26.380> probably<00:03:27.340> twelve<00:03:27.640> ninety-five<00:03:27.910> a
