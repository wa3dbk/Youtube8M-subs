piece

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.200 
piece
and<00:02:07.410> in<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.860> case<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.250> salmon<00:02:08.580> pizza<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:09.150> I

and in this case the salmon pizza do I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.700 
and in this case the salmon pizza do I
know<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.570> good<00:02:09.720> yeah<00:02:09.810> they're<00:02:09.960> not<00:02:10.110> no

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
know if it's good yeah they're not no

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.700 
know if it's good yeah they're not no
but<00:02:11.130> we'll<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.550> second<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:13.560> have

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
but we'll know in a second well we have

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.430 
but we'll know in a second well we have
a<00:02:13.740> cut<00:02:14.040> plated<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:15.960> should<00:02:16.110> try<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.320> at

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
a cut plated I think we should try it at

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.290 
a cut plated I think we should try it at
the<00:02:16.530> same<00:02:16.680> time<00:02:16.740> what<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:17.760> my

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
the same time what do you think my

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.630 
the same time what do you think my
thinking<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.960> we<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.410> pizza<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.190> salmon

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
thinking is we like pizza we like salmon

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.980 
thinking is we like pizza we like salmon
right<00:02:22.400> well<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.730> caramel<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.600> pizza

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
right well I like caramel and pizza

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.970 
right well I like caramel and pizza
doesn't<00:02:25.080> mean<00:02:25.380> they<00:02:25.470> should<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.770> caramel

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
doesn't mean they should have a caramel

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
doesn't mean they should have a caramel
Pizza<00:02:26.720> Pizza<00:02:27.720> sounds<00:02:28.020> awesome
