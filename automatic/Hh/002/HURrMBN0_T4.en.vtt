00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
what is his heritage now the popular

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
what is his heritage now the popular
theory<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.350> he<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> son

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
theory out there is that he is the son

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
theory out there is that he is the son
of<00:00:53.660> Han<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.690> Leia<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.280> Rey<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.820> his

character being played by Daisy Ridley

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.090 
character being played by Daisy Ridley
so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.300> might<00:01:03.600> cover<00:01:04.110> his<00:01:04.350> heritage<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.949> would

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so that might cover his heritage I would

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
so that might cover his heritage I would
definitely<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.180> far<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.780> who

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
definitely like that as far as who

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
definitely like that as far as who
trained<00:01:07.229> Katherine<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.520> supreme

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

leader<00:01:09.479> snoke<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> popular<00:01:10.530> consensus

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
leader snoke is the popular consensus

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
leader snoke is the popular consensus
right<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.630> most<00:01:12.810> likely<00:01:13.260> pick<00:01:13.470> as

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
right now and the most likely pick as

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
right now and the most likely pick as
well<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.549> he<00:01:14.729> clearly<00:01:14.939> has<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> knowledge

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
well because he clearly has a knowledge

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
well because he clearly has a knowledge
of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> force<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.740> thing<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> he<00:01:17.369> might

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of the force another thing is he might

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
of the force another thing is he might
have<00:01:17.670> learned<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.090> Sith<00:01:18.810> holocrons<00:01:19.409> which

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
have learned from Sith holocrons which

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.550 
have learned from Sith holocrons which
we<00:01:19.799> would<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.340> very<00:01:20.549> interesting<00:01:21.030> because

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
we would be very interesting because

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.780 
we would be very interesting because
supposedly<00:01:22.560> Darth<00:01:22.860> Vader<00:01:23.100> destroyed<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:23.759> of

supposedly Darth Vader destroyed all of
the<00:01:24.000> set<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.659> Supreme<00:01:25.049> Leader<00:01:25.229> Snoke<00:01:25.290> may<00:01:25.830> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the set but Supreme Leader Snoke may be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
the set but Supreme Leader Snoke may be
something<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.640> than<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.240> Sith<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
something more than just a Sith which is

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.620 
something more than just a Sith which is
very<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.619> interesting<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:29.880> number<00:01:30.240> for

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
very very interesting so my number for

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.499 
very very interesting so my number for

for the movie and I assume that he's out
there<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.090> exile<00:01:48.479> whether<00:01:49.020> he<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.590> seduced<00:01:50.009> by

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there in exile whether he was seduced by

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
there in exile whether he was seduced by
the<00:01:50.250> dark<00:01:50.369> side<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.970> he<00:01:51.180> needed<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the dark side and he needed to take a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
the dark side and he needed to take a
step<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> fighting<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.430> maybe

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
step back from the fighting and maybe

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
step back from the fighting and maybe
become<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> hermit<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.549> Jedi<00:01:56.549> similar<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> how

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
become a hermit like Jedi similar to how

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440 
become a hermit like Jedi similar to how
obi-wan<00:01:57.780> did<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.500> new<00:01:58.680> hope<00:01:59.180> there<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.299> also

obi-wan did in a new hope there are also

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
obi-wan did in a new hope there are also
theories<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.619> Sith

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
theories that there could be a Sith

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100 
theories that there could be a Sith
temple<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.729> he<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> protecting<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:03.630> would

temple that he is protecting which would

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
temple that he is protecting which would
be<00:02:04.229> interesting<00:02:04.680> him<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.640> ensuring<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
be interesting him kind of ensuring that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.930 
be interesting him kind of ensuring that
this<00:02:06.479> stay<00:02:07.049> gone<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.649> good<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.670> very

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this stay gone for good would be very

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
this stay gone for good would be very
very<00:02:09.209> cool<00:02:09.509> why<00:02:10.500> did<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.770> leave<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
very cool why did he leave the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.800 
very cool why did he leave the
resistance<00:02:11.610> again<00:02:12.060> he<00:02:12.360> might<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.690> been

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
resistance again he might have been

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.790 
resistance again he might have been
seduced<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.410> little<00:02:13.590> bit

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
required protection and he went off

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.100 
required protection and he went off
there<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.580> protect<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> which<00:02:30.630> would<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.900> very

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
there to protect it which would be very

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410 
there to protect it which would be very
very<00:02:31.260> interesting<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.850> number<00:02:33.150> three

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
very interesting so my number three

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.050 
very interesting so my number three
mystery<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.050> how<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.980> first<00:02:35.220> order<00:02:35.460> formed

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
mystery is how is the first order formed

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
mystery is how is the first order formed
who<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.050> charge<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.620> how<00:02:38.130> does<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> differ

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
who is in charge and how does it differ

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.980 
who is in charge and how does it differ
from<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.090> Empire<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.830> several

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
from the Empire so there is several

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.740 
from the Empire so there is several
first<00:02:42.990> order<00:02:43.550> candidates<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.850> could<00:02:45.210> be<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
first order candidates that could be in

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.330 
first order candidates that could be in
the<00:02:46.200> running<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.830> leader

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the running to be the leader

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670 
the running to be the leader
I<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:47.850> think<00:02:48.270> supreme<00:02:48.630> leader<00:02:48.900> snoke<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
I do think supreme leader snoke is the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.860 
I do think supreme leader snoke is the
leader<00:02:49.980> obviously<00:02:50.610> by<00:02:50.790> his<00:02:50.940> name<00:02:51.090> general<00:02:51.570> Hux

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
leader obviously by his name general Hux

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
leader obviously by his name general Hux
should<00:02:52.230> probably<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:52.950> level<00:02:53.130> below<00:02:53.370> him

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
should probably be one level below him

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.540 
should probably be one level below him
then<00:02:54.330> kylo<00:02:54.690> Ren<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.410> Captain<00:02:55.920> phasma

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
then kylo Ren and then Captain phasma

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.150 
then kylo Ren and then Captain phasma
would<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.210> my<00:02:57.420> guest<00:02:57.780> these<00:02:58.140> chrome<00:02:58.800> trooper

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
would be my guest these chrome trooper

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340 
would be my guest these chrome trooper
played<00:02:59.370> by<00:02:59.520> Gwendoline<00:03:00.060> Christie<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:01.110> that's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
played by Gwendoline Christie so that's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.710 
played by Gwendoline Christie so that's
kind<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.740> order<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> see<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.730> how<00:03:03.360> did<00:03:03.570> it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
kind of the order I see it in how did it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.540 
kind of the order I see it in how did it
form<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.260> believe<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.740> moths<00:03:05.070> might<00:03:05.400> have

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
form I believe the moths might have

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.520 
form I believe the moths might have
formed<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.000> or<00:03:06.180> Supreme<00:03:06.750> Leader<00:03:06.960> Snoke<00:03:06.990> could

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
formed it or Supreme Leader Snoke could

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800 
formed it or Supreme Leader Snoke could
have<00:03:07.650> been<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> being<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:09.210> around<00:03:09.660> during

have been a being that was around during
the<00:03:10.200> rise<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> Empire<00:03:11.340> even<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:11.850> he<00:03:12.330> is

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the rise of the Empire even if he is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.800 
the rise of the Empire even if he is
possibly<00:03:12.990> even<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.560> old<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.790> he<00:03:15.300> kind

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
possibly even that old and then he kind

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.020 
possibly even that old and then he kind
of<00:03:15.900> stepped<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.620> soon<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.980> he<00:03:17.130> saw<00:03:17.370> Darth

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
of stepped in as soon as he saw Darth

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
of stepped in as soon as he saw Darth
Sidious<00:03:18.120> being<00:03:18.959> destroyed<00:03:19.350> by<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> Darth<00:03:20.040> Vader

Sidious being destroyed by a Darth Vader
and<00:03:20.640> he<00:03:21.300> stepped<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.170> formed<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.770> first

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
and he stepped in and formed the first

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.820 
and he stepped in and formed the first
order<00:03:23.400> an<00:03:23.690> organization<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.870> kind<00:03:25.680> of

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
order an organization that kind of

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.740 
order an organization that kind of
shares<00:03:26.370> some<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.790> same<00:03:27.000> ideals<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.630> the

shares some of the same ideals of the
Empire<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:28.590> are<00:03:28.739> different<00:03:29.100> maybe<00:03:29.310> they're

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
Empire but are different maybe they're

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.340 
Empire but are different maybe they're
actually<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.120> quite<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.570> harsh<00:03:30.810> or<00:03:31.080> even

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
actually not quite as harsh or even

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
actually not quite as harsh or even
they're<00:03:31.500> more<00:03:31.739> harsh<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.280> they<00:03:33.090> want<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.450> just

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
they're more harsh and they want to just

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720 
they're more harsh and they want to just
completely<00:03:34.230> take<00:03:34.560> over<00:03:34.830> everything<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.520> be

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
completely take over everything and be

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.630 
completely take over everything and be
the<00:03:35.910> first<00:03:36.180> order<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.070> create<00:03:38.070> peace<00:03:38.430> and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the first order and create peace and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.390 
the first order and create peace and
harmony<00:03:38.870> throughout<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.080> galaxy<00:03:40.650> by<00:03:41.100> means

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
harmony throughout the galaxy by means

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.460 
harmony throughout the galaxy by means
that<00:03:41.760> may<00:03:41.910> not<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.120> good<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:42.660> everyone<00:03:43.290> I

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
that may not be good for everyone I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.590 
that may not be good for everyone I
think<00:03:43.739> that's<00:03:44.130> kind<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.550> how<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:44.940> going

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
think that's kind of how it is going

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.510 
think that's kind of how it is going
there<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.959> course<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.739> already<00:03:46.950> differs<00:03:47.370> in

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
there of course it already differs in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.100 
there of course it already differs in
leadership<00:03:48.030> from<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.270> Empire<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:48.989> know

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
leadership from the Empire so we know

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.900 
leadership from the Empire so we know
that<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.830> that's<00:03:50.010> basically<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.880> so

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
that so that's basically what we know so

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.510 
that so that's basically what we know so
far<00:03:51.180> my<00:03:52.050> theory<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.800> Supreme<00:03:53.340> Leader

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
far my theory is that Supreme Leader

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.699 
far my theory is that Supreme Leader
Snoke<00:03:53.610> did<00:03:54.120> take<00:03:54.390> over<00:03:54.570> after<00:03:54.930> Sidious<00:03:55.500> was

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
Snoke did take over after Sidious was

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.440 
Snoke did take over after Sidious was
there<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.640> he<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.270> shadows

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
there and that he was in the shadows

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.810 
there and that he was in the shadows
there<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.590> sure<00:03:58.800> if<00:03:58.920> Sidious<00:03:59.280> was<00:03:59.459> aware<00:03:59.790> of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
there I not sure if Sidious was aware of

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.370 
there I not sure if Sidious was aware of
him<00:04:00.060> at<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.300> time<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> original<00:04:01.170> trilogy

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
him at the time of the original trilogy

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.150 
him at the time of the original trilogy
but<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:03.270> definitely<00:04:03.660> think<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.410> he<00:04:04.980> was<00:04:05.100> in

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
but I definitely think that he was in

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.699 
but I definitely think that he was in
the<00:04:05.340> shadows<00:04:05.790> possibly<00:04:06.660> even<00:04:07.020> someone<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the shadows possibly even someone the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.199 
the shadows possibly even someone the
Sidious<00:04:08.190> answer<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.000> would<00:04:09.180> be

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
Sidious answer to that would be

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.970 
Sidious answer to that would be
interesting<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.440> he<00:04:10.590> stepped<00:04:10.860> forward

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
interesting and then he stepped forward

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.520 
interesting and then he stepped forward
after<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:12.090> Sith<00:04:12.390> were<00:04:12.630> destroyed<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.290> took

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
after the Sith were destroyed and took

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.979 
after the Sith were destroyed and took
over<00:04:13.709> so<00:04:14.670> that's<00:04:14.850> very<00:04:15.030> interesting<00:04:15.360> my

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
over so that's very interesting my

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.229 
over so that's very interesting my
number<00:04:16.260> two<00:04:16.530> theory<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.160> who<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.120> new

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
number two theory is who are the new

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.180 
number two theory is who are the new
Jedi<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.900> who<00:04:19.019> will<00:04:19.169> train<00:04:19.470> them<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.859> do

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
Jedi and who will train them I do

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.860 
Jedi and who will train them I do
believe<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.700> there<00:04:21.030> are<00:04:21.060> two<00:04:21.299> new<00:04:21.450> Jedi<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
believe that there are two new Jedi that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.200 
believe that there are two new Jedi that
we<00:04:22.140> will<00:04:22.260> be<00:04:22.380> seeing<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.919> Episode<00:04:23.640> seven<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
we will be seeing in Episode seven and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.300 
we will be seeing in Episode seven and
that's<00:04:24.300> rey<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.660> finn<00:04:24.900> john<00:04:25.800> boyega's

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
that's rey and finn john boyega's

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.500 
that's rey and finn john boyega's
character<00:04:26.729> finn<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.270> they

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
character finn and they

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.840 
character finn and they
Ridley's<00:04:27.990> character<00:04:28.500> ray<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.100> do<00:04:29.370> believe<00:04:29.820> that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
Ridley's character ray I do believe that

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.910 
Ridley's character ray I do believe that
they<00:04:30.060> will<00:04:30.210> both<00:04:30.390> become<00:04:30.630> Jedi<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.410> would<00:04:31.770> like

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
they will both become Jedi I would like

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.370 
they will both become Jedi I would like
to<00:04:32.040> see<00:04:32.190> ray<00:04:32.460> inherent<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.150> inherit<00:04:33.900> the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
to see ray inherent this inherit the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.950 
to see ray inherent this inherit the
Skywalker<00:04:34.920> lightsaber<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.760> thin<00:04:36.390> craft<00:04:36.810> a

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
Skywalker lightsaber and thin craft a

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.900 
Skywalker lightsaber and thin craft a
lightsaber<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.530> his<00:04:37.680> own<00:04:37.860> as<00:04:38.100> far<00:04:38.370> as<00:04:38.700> who<00:04:38.790> will

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
lightsaber of his own as far as who will

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.940 
lightsaber of his own as far as who will
be<00:04:39.060> training<00:04:39.450> him<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.840> think<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.260> answer<00:04:40.560> is

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
be training him I think the answer is

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.310 
be training him I think the answer is
obvious<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.880> will<00:04:42.030> be<00:04:42.150> Luke<00:04:42.420> as<00:04:42.660> far<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:42.930> will

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
obvious it will be Luke as far as will

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.380 
obvious it will be Luke as far as will
this<00:04:43.500> training<00:04:43.800> occur<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:44.910> film<00:04:45.150> or<00:04:45.360> a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
this training occur in this film or a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.990 
this training occur in this film or a
future<00:04:45.750> film<00:04:46.080> that<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.740> unknown<00:04:47.160> possibly<00:04:47.940> a

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
future film that is unknown possibly a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.610 
future film that is unknown possibly a
future<00:04:48.360> film<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.780> think<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.200> film<00:04:49.380> would<00:04:49.590> be

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
future film I think this film would be

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.440 
future film I think this film would be
the<00:04:50.010> journey<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.640> getting<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.090> Luke<00:04:51.240> and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
the journey to getting to Luke and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.960 
the journey to getting to Luke and
figuring<00:04:52.320> out<00:04:52.410> where<00:04:52.620> Luke<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.670> then<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
figuring out where Luke is and then the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.490 
figuring out where Luke is and then the
next<00:04:54.180> film<00:04:54.510> would<00:04:54.720> be<00:04:54.750> about<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.200> training

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
next film would be about the training

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.150 
next film would be about the training
similar<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.550> even<00:04:56.910> how<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.590> Empire<00:04:58.590> was<00:04:58.860> about

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
similar to even how a Empire was about

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.620 
similar to even how a Empire was about
the<00:04:59.310> training<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.850> Luke<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.120> kind<00:05:00.540> of

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
the training and Luke just kind of

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.420 
the training and Luke just kind of
discovered<00:05:01.230> he<00:05:01.380> was<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.560> force<00:05:01.860> sensitive<00:05:02.310> in

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
discovered he was a force sensitive in

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.980 
discovered he was a force sensitive in
the<00:05:02.550> first<00:05:02.790> film<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.210> kind<00:05:03.420> of<00:05:03.480> mirrors<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
the first film it kind of mirrors the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.410 
the first film it kind of mirrors the
original<00:05:04.380> trilogy<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.920> that<00:05:05.070> regard<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:06.270> my

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
original trilogy in that regard so my

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.440 
original trilogy in that regard so my
number<00:05:06.870> one<00:05:07.080> theory<00:05:07.650> or<00:05:08.270> mystery<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.420> I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
number one theory or mystery that I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.900 
number one theory or mystery that I
would<00:05:09.690> like<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.440> about<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:11.010> who<00:05:11.760> is

Serkis seems like he's doing a very very
good<00:05:31.530> job<00:05:31.710> there<00:05:31.980> but<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:33.060> he<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.300> Sith<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:33.930> more
