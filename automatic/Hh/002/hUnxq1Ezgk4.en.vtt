has moved and made smaller I'm not sure

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.800

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
quite easy to just hit all contacts in

that<00:02:32.090> speed<00:02:32.330> dial<00:02:32.510> area<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.110> now<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.530> might

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that speed dial area and now it might

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.380 
that speed dial area and now it might
seem<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.100> bit<00:02:34.220> harder<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.700> actually<00:02:35.090> hit

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
seem a little bit harder to actually hit

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
seem a little bit harder to actually hit
that<00:02:35.570> all<00:02:35.720> contacts<00:02:36.350> but<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.830> guess<00:02:37.250> time<00:02:37.670> will

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that all contacts but I guess time will

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
on over to the history so we can still

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.650
