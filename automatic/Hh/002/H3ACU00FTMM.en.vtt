now<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:56.330> haven't<00:03:57.330> tested<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.050> yet<00:03:58.320> but<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.680> do

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
now I haven't tested it out yet but I do

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.250 
now I haven't tested it out yet but I do
think<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.400> isn't<00:03:59.870> definitely<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> possibility

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
think it isn't definitely a possibility

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.430 
think it isn't definitely a possibility
that<00:04:01.800> my<00:04:01.950> heavy<00:04:02.130> armor<00:04:02.750> actually<00:04:03.750> led<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.200> eat

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that my heavy armor actually led to eat

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.590 
that my heavy armor actually led to eat
more<00:04:04.770> bullets<00:04:05.250> especially<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:05.970> put<00:04:06.150> say

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
more bullets especially if you put say

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.240 
more bullets especially if you put say
something<00:04:06.960> like<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.260> heavy<00:04:07.440> armor<00:04:07.800> on<00:04:07.950> with

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
something like the heavy armor on with

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.140
