a comparable experience so I just

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
a comparable experience so I just

the<00:00:42.540> Moto<00:00:42.750> G<00:00:43.399> now<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:45.329> worth<00:00:45.480> pointing<00:00:45.780> out

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the Moto G now it's worth pointing out

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.950 
the Moto G now it's worth pointing out
the<00:00:46.379> Moto<00:00:46.590> G<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.719> speaker<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> back

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the Moto G has the speaker on the back

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.790 
the Moto G has the speaker on the back
whereas<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> Moto<00:00:50.250> e<00:00:50.399> has<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> front

whereas the Moto e has on the front

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.479 
whereas the Moto e has on the front
which<00:00:52.800> could<00:00:53.309> make<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> difference<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:55.489> say

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
which could make a difference to say

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
which could make a difference to say
I've<00:00:57.090> got<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> Venice<00:00:57.870> Beach<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.649> be

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
I've got this Venice Beach and be

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:10.300 
I've got this Venice Beach and be
through<00:00:59.280> here<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:06.030> sounds<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.360> happen

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.890 

it<00:01:11.310> obviously<00:01:11.400> sounds<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.720> it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it obviously sounds back there when it's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.010 
it obviously sounds back there when it's
not<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> speak<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
not going to speak it down in the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.640 
not going to speak it down in the
surface<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> G<00:01:20.150> what<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:22.049> Moto<00:01:22.290> e

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
surface but that's the G what the Moto e

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
surface but that's the G what the Moto e
obviously<00:01:23.520> has<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> speaker<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.180> front<00:01:24.750> which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
obviously has a speaker on front which

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
obviously has a speaker on front which
is<00:01:25.500> better<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.890> sharing<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.729> because

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is better for sharing i think because

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
is better for sharing i think because
this<00:01:27.210> could<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.500> beyond<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this could be it's not go beyond this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
this could be it's not go beyond this
back<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> hear<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:35.000> there's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
back you can hear that so there's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.370 
back you can hear that so there's
approximately<00:01:36.329> same<00:01:36.900> volume<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:42.049> few<00:01:43.049> turns

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
approximately same volume a few turns

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.209 
approximately same volume a few turns
just<00:01:44.100> temporary

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.510 

now<00:01:53.219> in<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.299> every<00:01:54.869> area<00:01:55.520> when

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
now in pretty much every area when

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.330 
now in pretty much every area when
comparing<00:01:57.060> these<00:01:57.180> two<00:01:57.240> phones<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.340> would

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
comparing these two phones I would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
comparing these two phones I would
expect<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:02.000> Moto<00:02:03.000> e<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.720> weaker<00:02:04.200> because

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
expect the Moto e to be weaker because

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
expect the Moto e to be weaker because
it's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> cheaper<00:02:05.340> fine<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.820> made<00:02:06.210> with

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it's a cheaper fine it's made with

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's a cheaper fine it's made with
cheaper<00:02:06.750> materials<00:02:07.009> or<00:02:08.009> lesser<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.239> know

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
cheaper materials or lesser you know

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.589 
cheaper materials or lesser you know
capable<00:02:09.989> materials<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.970> smaller<00:02:11.970> internal

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
capable materials like smaller internal

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.770 
capable materials like smaller internal
storage<00:02:13.110> nor<00:02:13.440> strong<00:02:13.769> camera<00:02:14.400> etc<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.660> in

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
storage nor strong camera etc but in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.650 
storage nor strong camera etc but in
this<00:02:16.080> i<00:02:16.410> think<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.069> motor<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.300> least

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
this i think the motor we at least

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.360 
this i think the motor we at least
equals<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> speaker<00:02:22.650> placement<00:02:22.830> may

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
equals it and the speaker placement may

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.640 
equals it and the speaker placement may
in<00:02:23.580> fact<00:02:23.760> make<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> superior<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:25.140> some<00:02:25.319> people

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
in fact make it superior for some people

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.009 
in fact make it superior for some people
buying<00:02:25.830> these<00:02:26.190> fines<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:27.480> thanks<00:02:27.870> for
