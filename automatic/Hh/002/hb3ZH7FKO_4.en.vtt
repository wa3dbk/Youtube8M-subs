00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
I'm gonna show you three ways that you

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.150 
I'm gonna show you three ways that you
can<00:00:09.300> put<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> five<00:00:09.690> stroke<00:00:09.900> roll<00:00:09.960> together<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
can put a five stroke roll together the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.430 
can put a five stroke roll together the
first<00:00:11.370> way<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.330> two<00:00:12.660> double<00:00:12.990> strokes

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
first way you can do two double strokes

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200 
first way you can do two double strokes
followed<00:00:13.920> by<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> single<00:00:14.490> stroke<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.969> that'd<00:00:15.089> be

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
followed by a single stroke so that'd be

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
followed by a single stroke so that'd be
a<00:00:15.240> double<00:00:15.630> stroke<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.020> each<00:00:16.230> hand<00:00:18.920> followed<00:00:19.920> by

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
a double stroke in each hand followed by

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.050 
a double stroke in each hand followed by
a<00:00:20.100> single<00:00:20.400> stroke

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a single stroke

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
a single stroke
starting<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.720> either<00:00:21.869> hand<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> also

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
starting with either hand you can also

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.310 
starting with either hand you can also
do<00:00:23.369> five<00:00:23.640> single<00:00:24.119> stroke<00:00:26.960> start<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.199> either

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
do five single stroke start with either

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
do five single stroke start with either
hand<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.670> also<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.859> flam<00:00:31.859> now<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.880> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
hand you can also do a flam now this is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
hand you can also do a flam now this is
using<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> showed<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.680> two

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
did with that with the signal strokes

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.679 
did with that with the signal strokes
what<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:19.909> lot<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.180> times<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.540> do

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
what I like to do a lot of times to do

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.509 
what I like to do a lot of times to do
that<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.319> linear<00:03:21.500> fashion<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.129> can<00:03:22.250> do<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.489> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
that in a linear fashion you can do it a

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.550 
that in a linear fashion you can do it a
couple<00:03:22.849> ways<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.269> can<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.689> it<00:03:23.870> like<00:03:24.349> with<00:03:24.530> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
couple ways you can do it like with a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.410 
couple ways you can do it like with a
stop<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.129> the<00:03:25.159> end<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.849> also<00:03:26.000> do<00:03:26.299> it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
stop at the end and you can also do it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:52.400 
stop at the end and you can also do it
just<00:03:26.599> a<00:03:26.659> linear<00:03:27.260> fashion<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:27.890> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:06.350 

you<00:03:53.410> can<00:03:53.560> also<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.310> the<00:04:04.410> sticking

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
you can also do it with the sticking

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.800 
you can also do it with the sticking
right<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.690> left<00:04:07.900> right<00:04:08.560> right<00:04:09.450> which<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.600> a

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
right and left right right which is a

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.830 
right and left right right which is a
paradiddle<00:04:11.320> followed<00:04:12.220> by<00:04:12.600> single<00:04:13.600> stroke

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
paradiddle followed by single stroke

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.750 
paradiddle followed by single stroke
that's<00:04:14.470> another<00:04:14.710> way<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.950> get<00:04:15.160> spot<00:04:15.460> strokes<00:04:15.820> I

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
that's another way to get spot strokes I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:34.670 
that's another way to get spot strokes I
can<00:04:18.760> even<00:04:18.970> flam<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.690> flammable<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.620> fire

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.260 

you<00:04:35.680> can<00:04:35.740> take<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.520> come<00:04:36.790> up<00:04:36.940> with<00:04:37.090> maybe

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you can take this and come up with maybe

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.360 
you can take this and come up with maybe
some<00:04:37.600> Olmert<00:04:37.990> some<00:04:38.290> variations<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:39.010> your<00:04:39.220> own

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
some Olmert some variations of your own
