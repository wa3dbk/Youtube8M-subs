00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.590
 a wonderful good day together 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.260
 we have that again today 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.330
 Weekly review of the 24 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 until the 23rd we start the topics with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 the 24th 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.359
 and thus a militia from the super test 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.060
 and that is the card stalingrad 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.279
 come there is also the minimap this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.679
 will be 909 hundred meters 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 and you can see it as well as that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.270
 whole will look like and there are also 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.300
 yet another picture and there you see 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 again completely from stalingrad in 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 then war so you can see that too 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.080
 the shown is true to detail and where 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.360
 it all comes so he came forth from the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.490
 star is looking forward to the stalingrad theme 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 another card from the super that 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 that was also placed on 24.2 and indeed 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.290
 Has she lost her internal name? 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.270
 City 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.370
 the special thing about this card is that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.520
 completely symmetrical is how to get to the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.720
 Looks all over and this card for both 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 randomly chosen as well as for team 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.130
 battles probably tested whether this now 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
 Sun comes or not can not be said 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.909
 but as I said, definitely 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.499
 what else just a complete 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.749
 completely symmetrical map is the 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:24.749
 developer diary at 2.24 something 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:26.579
 990 is a new one 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.840
 option acquires option to adjust 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.600
 of the visual field that means you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.069
 can choose separately whether you just the old one 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 wants to drive away something with a view 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.179
 micro patch is added but to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.289
 Are we still going to come or if you just want that? 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.600
 wants to have the field of vision as she now 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:45.960
 just the case is with 8.11 to 125 2 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.429
 because it was said that the video to 9.0 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.139
 will be released soon 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.090
 it was published but it was still 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.749
 No date but you can do it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.049
 hopefully very soon also be purely 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.850
 was in the developer diary on 26.2 since 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.280
 said that roaming at the beginning only for 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.649
 wot will be available it's called world 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 of warplanes remains as it is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.590
 now is the case and one possible 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.489
 may be given soon 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.189
 and possibly to the 95th 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.019
 each one of the dates so powerful 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.459
 knows that since at least the war one 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.680
 was officially in Russia 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.609
 and there is probably the su 76 4 3 td then 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 so it looks like a lot 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.250
 very coherent and very coherent 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.650
 to be distinguished by a four man 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.720
 occupation a reasonable impact 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.969
 and good ones hurt from that 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 I think for an animal 3 it can be 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.250
 be very very good tank and just 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.889
 even a gift even better 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.010
 then wargaming on 27.2 itself 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.169
 another look at the version 9.0 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.019
 and there was again 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.579
 said the topic explosions 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.220
 munitions dump explosions where that 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.109
 pair of armor because then the leads to it 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.569
 that the tower will be torn away and 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.579
 then you can just go here 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.319
 read developer diary on 28 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.930
 the newest and the most important was here 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.879
 probably that the test server is not from 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.329
 a march or april first appear 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.340
 will and as I said myself have too 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.690
 no information on this as soon as I am 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.659
 because what weight usually that of course 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.650
 but that's what the patch will be 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:34.120
 not before april 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.659
 a micro patch will come soon 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.329
 for the version 0 8 11 and that's just that 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.870
 already mentioned field of vision is also 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.310
 the version of 8.10 brought and the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.310
 mistake what one 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.079
 there is a delay when a grenade 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 is also fixed 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.659
 the micro patch will probably be around 150 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.699
 have megabytes and appear in 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.989
 Russia on the third third that is 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:03.220
 pretty likely a two days 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.180
 then later with us then storm has 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.560
 on the 28th 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.299
 two very strong 90's 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.669
 expressed and I just want you there 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.729
 just draw a small detail from it 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.190
 because that's a lot like you see 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:20.680
 Of course, I also link in the video 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.650
 namely hayward nothing comes with 90 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.919
 but this year just like 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.139
 not said with the announced patch 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:34.120
 9.0 then of course again 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.800
 Nice detail and pictures of the hd 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.450
 models especially here of course 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.650
 The art even nice to see 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.630
 in cannon run the message of the whole 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.020
 that is really very detailed that 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.599
 It has become very very nice so 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.840
 visually I think wot then needs 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.830
 definitely not hide anymore 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.289
 the topic of storage 90 then became synonymous 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.779
 for the second part because it is 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.300
 as I said was extremely much and here 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:10.479
 now the topic of new engines and chains 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.789
 Noises will not come in 9.0 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.610
 but with the testserver of 90 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.260
 because these noises are tested 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.510
 to get a feedback and 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.949
 these should probably be in version 9 1 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.139
 or 9 go live 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.270
 So you can do it from the testserver already 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.990
 then listen like the whole one 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.479
 should develop 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.510
 then wargaming took place on the first march 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.520
 on the subject latency problems expressed 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.169
 and that they are just optimizing 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.219
 and other things can do it again 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.800
 read everything here 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:45.159
 and there is also a day for everyone 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.529
 Gremium Spielzeit given that now 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.150
 is enough or too little or what you are 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.029
 you can also think of that 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.610
 Write comments 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:56.199
 Developer diary in the first third there 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.330
 It was said with the introduction of roaming 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.099
 it will not be possible to gold 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.300
 other prices to buy or on 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.039
 to buy other servers 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.449
 that is already in the past 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.250
 that means the actions 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.409
 are always the actions on the 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.120
 own server and exist 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.650
 they stay so you can not 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.330
 that go on a server and then in the 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:18.760
 to buy armor of the discounted is there 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.550
 now for the first time on the second march the 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.320
 Winner of a bonus code on youtube 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.240
 and it's easy to participate 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.900
 he just has a video 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.089
 comments on what was chosen randomly 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.039
 has been and then has a bonus code 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.169
 won and to participate yourself 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.839
 you just have to do all of them if possible 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.129
 youtube videos of a month with yours 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:40.779
 world of tanks nick come 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.449
 and then he's already taking part 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.679
 it does not have to be a world of tanks 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.439
 video just act around 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:48.909
 indiscriminate of me so that's when 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.830
 you just want to share one 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.050
 video writes in the comments of yours 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.439
 world of tanks subscribes to the whole and 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.119
 then you are already there and that 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.300
 last topic now to look back is the 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:02.889
 second developer diary and indeed was 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.019
 said that at a munition camp 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.330
 hit that does not always explode 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:10.779
 but just burn out or 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.610
 can burn and it could be there 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.999
 imagine an effect in 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.990
 wot is introduced 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:19.029
 But there you have to, of course, for now 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.459
 see how the whole is evolving too 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:24.519
 the new graphic but of which he would be 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:25.389
 that's also possible that's it then 

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:27.339
 with the retrospect 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.379
 I hope you are informed again and 

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.729
 could be good in the wide world of 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.619
 Tanks start time 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.199
 I wish you much fun and I would 

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.829
 me of course about subscriptions and 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.389
 comments are very happy 

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:39.389
 see you soon and servus
