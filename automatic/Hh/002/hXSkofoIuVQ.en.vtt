00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.600
 Thank you very much for the current suicide bombing 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.430
 eh 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.400
 I say that I think the place 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:18.630
 Do you understand it is 5:40 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.500
 The truth is that even now if you go to bed late 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.500
 But it is 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.150
 Since Ja' vibrators if there are 5 lower of earthquake 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:37.270
 If you think it 's just four days, you'll have a light demon 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.829
 Well , I think it's a regular earthquake , and it's a bit warmer than outside air 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.659
 It is called Dokan 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:47.229
 I was surprised and maybe it was already awful even with Twitter, so if I saw it on Twitter 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.240
 In another such felt or seismic intensity 5 of 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.420
 so 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.360
 Something 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:00.670
 It was already worn out of the timeline or the line 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.090
 In you buy do not know how I was surprised I do not know something now but says toilet painful belly 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.090
 Yes 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.600
 Neda 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:13.250
 I really do not touch in 5410 minutes 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.350
 I thought I would go somewhere today but it's a bit scary 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:22.409
 The groom is still scary likely to come What do I of you 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.770
 Somehow the spirit and calligraphy and along with direct-type earthquake in softening the per cent 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.270
 That would be something Well what Nn 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 I don't like it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.880
 Seismic intensity of 7 Poi no Wow trust something amazing comes to Tokyo from today 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.620
 And everyone also aligned such as emergency goods in or say 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.120
 Let's all go by mouth 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.080
 eh 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.560
 That's why everyone first hides under the desk 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.000
 It is to open the part window 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.810
 It's a little vacant, let's keep it important to raise it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.740
 so 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.740
 I was a grandma 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.830
 Continue to the last 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.880
 Asoda Finally, it's was postal um 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.050
 There is an earthquake early warning that I really wanted it to be 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:15.319
 Tighter and tighter I wanted you to become a solid 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.560
 The writing and writing techniques that came to me are coming, but it is a little 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.230
 I was able to say with the boundary of I say say so So maybe 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.730
 Everyone I have many people to still say Toka's Ya softened surprised at that mobile Toka mode 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.030
 It's because of such mold Earthquake Warning 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 At that time 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.760
 Only then is a place is better, which had sounded Nde there is something this with the person who had been also doing their own 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.760
 I think it is good
