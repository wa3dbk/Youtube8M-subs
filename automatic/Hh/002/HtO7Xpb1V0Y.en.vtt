00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
been relocated down here where the old

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
been relocated down here where the old
collector<00:01:07.800> box<00:01:08.010> used<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:10.460> other<00:01:11.460> than<00:01:11.580> that

collector box used to go other than that
the<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> modules<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> same<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.340> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the the modules are just the same as for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.230 
the the modules are just the same as for
the<00:01:14.730> cafe<00:01:15.000> racer<00:01:15.240> kit<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.580> expands

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the cafe racer kit so this just expands

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.560 
the cafe racer kit so this just expands
the<00:01:18.330> options<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.050> can<00:01:19.170> build<00:01:20.570> using

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the options of what you can build using

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.370 
the options of what you can build using
our<00:01:21.690> modules

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
our modules

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
our modules
I<00:01:25.460> think<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.580> turned<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:26.970> great

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I think it's turned out great

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.160 
I think it's turned out great
we've<00:01:27.900> gone<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:29.330> slightly<00:01:30.330> bluey<00:01:30.690> tint

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
