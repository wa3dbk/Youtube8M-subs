it's also important you can see the
output<00:02:27.980> from<00:02:28.519> titanium<00:02:28.970> mobile<00:02:29.480> also<00:02:29.870> here

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
output from titanium mobile also here

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.170 
output from titanium mobile also here
and<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.739> simple<00:02:34.160> crud<00:02:34.459> application<00:02:34.580> which

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
and I have simple crud application which

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.830 
and I have simple crud application which
I<00:02:35.299> can<00:02:35.480> use<00:02:35.590> based<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> model<00:02:37.160> i<00:02:37.370> defined

see the the ex ex ex property attribute

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.539 
see the the ex ex ex property attribute
is<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.299> type<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.750> an<00:02:50.900> enum<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.709> here<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.310> get

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
is as the type is an enum so here I get

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.710 
is as the type is an enum so here I get
a<00:02:52.579> selection<00:02:52.940> box<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:54.110> choose<00:02:54.319> from<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:56.569> H

free<00:03:48.169> database<00:03:48.819> let's<00:03:49.819> start<00:03:49.940> customizing

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
free database let's start customizing

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.390 
free database let's start customizing
the<00:03:51.290> example<00:03:51.919> a<00:03:52.569> little<00:03:53.569> bit<00:03:53.720> let's<00:03:54.680> say<00:03:54.919> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
the example a little bit let's say the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.289 
the example a little bit let's say the
type<00:03:55.780> instead<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.930> type<00:03:57.139> we<00:03:57.440> call<00:03:57.650> this

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
type instead of type we call this

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:06.940 
type instead of type we call this
general<00:04:01.030> make<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:05.440> animal<00:04:06.440> liberation

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
general make it this animal liberation

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.440 
general make it this animal liberation
and<00:04:10.060> let's<00:04:11.060> say<00:04:11.269> we<00:04:11.690> don't<00:04:11.959> only<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:13.450> docs

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
and let's say we don't only have a docs

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.960 
and let's say we don't only have a docs
but

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
but

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.050 
but
we<00:04:16.810> also<00:04:17.019> have<00:04:18.540> cats<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.850> same

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
we also have cats with the same

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.550 
we also have cats with the same
properties<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:24.420> let's<00:04:25.420> say<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:26.080> cats<00:04:26.380> have

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
properties and let's say this cats have

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.590 
properties and let's say this cats have
a<00:04:26.590> cat<00:04:29.220> cat<00:04:30.220> type<00:04:32.520> we're<00:04:33.520> fat<00:04:33.760> cats<00:04:34.260> we<00:04:35.260> have

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
a cat cat type we're fat cats we have

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.550 
a cat cat type we're fat cats we have
specific<00:04:37.600> ads<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.910> we<00:04:39.910> have<00:04:40.090> stray<00:04:40.390> cats<00:04:40.690> so

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
specific ads and we have stray cats so

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.880 
specific ads and we have stray cats so
okay<00:04:42.420> these<00:04:43.420> are<00:04:43.690> off<00:04:44.280> cat<00:04:45.280> type<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.230> select

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
okay these are off cat type so I select

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.080 
okay these are off cat type so I select
the<00:04:48.190> project<00:04:48.720> we<00:04:49.720> run<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.350> generator<00:04:50.500> and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.460 

start<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.240> simulator<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:57.750> now<00:04:58.750> we<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:59.020> that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
start the simulator and now we see that

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.770 
start the simulator and now we see that
we<00:04:59.800> don't<00:04:59.950> only<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.340> docs<00:05:00.790> but<00:05:01.060> we<00:05:01.270> also<00:05:01.480> have

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
we don't only have docs but we also have

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.780 
we don't only have docs but we also have
cats<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.920> let's<00:05:03.750> create<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:04.900> cat<00:05:05.140> first<00:05:08.669> call<00:05:09.669> it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
cats so let's create a cat first call it

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.460 
cats so let's create a cat first call it
Peter<00:05:11.460> Peter<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:12.820> strike<00:05:13.330> head<00:05:13.980> and<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.970> h's

Peter Peter is a strike head and the h's

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:24.870 
Peter Peter is a strike head and the h's
life<00:05:18.570> then<00:05:19.570> great<00:05:20.040> also<00:05:21.040> doc<00:05:21.460> oh<00:05:23.640> like<00:05:24.640> this

prototyping<00:06:23.770> or<00:06:24.099> the<00:06:25.090> scaffolding<00:06:25.690> so<00:06:25.870> you

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
prototyping or the scaffolding so you

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.250 
prototyping or the scaffolding so you
get

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
get

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.760
