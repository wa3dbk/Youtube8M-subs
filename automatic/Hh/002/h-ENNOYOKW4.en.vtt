and I thought that was a nice touch the
final<00:03:39.209> episode<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.660> last<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.230> last

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
final episode and that last that last

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.440 
final episode and that last that last
bit<00:03:40.709> after<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.519> closing<00:03:41.760> credits<00:03:42.000> with<00:03:42.300> more

bit after the closing credits with more

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.610 
bit after the closing credits with more
like<00:03:42.570> an<00:03:42.690> Egyptian<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.110> be<00:03:43.170> interesting<00:03:43.530> if

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
like an Egyptian to be interesting if

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.820 
like an Egyptian to be interesting if
they<00:03:43.709> changed<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.390> or<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:46.709> they

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
they changed that to do or to if they

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.890 
they changed that to do or to if they
change<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.430> get<00:03:48.030> back<00:03:48.209> by<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.480> Beatles
