00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.090
 advertising 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 the main house though not that much 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.360
 spiteful plant his sasha and he take off 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.919
 also in the video about food 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 varied and cook it is simple and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 understandable dishes from the available products in 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.930
 general come meet see 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 evil channel a lot and now to the recipe 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.370
 pizza burger this time dough I bought in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.790
 shop so immediately proceed to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 tomato sauce first onion chop it 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.430
 you need very small and by the way half 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.900
 medium bulb will be enough 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.900
 also pretty cut 1 clove of garlic 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.970
 I warmed up the stewpan and poured about two 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.239
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.239
 throw onions fry it for a couple of minutes 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.180
 add garlic hold a couple more minutes 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.000
 the oil absorbs the aroma of garlic and 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.010
 subsequently decorate the south characteristic 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.780
 I take off with a slightly perceptible garlic tone 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.480
 the plates for a while so the onions and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.520
 the garlic is not burnt on him'll do the tomato 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.950
 need 1 large tomato 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 but before you chop it, I delete it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.040
 core 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.550
 By the way, I removed the skin from the tomato 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:44.210
 But so that she easily filmed I plunged 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.400
 its for 15 seconds the boiling water returned the money 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.930
 on the stove 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.280
 send here tomato pouring in about 200 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.700
 grams of tomato puree 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.830
 and now stirring from time to time 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 leave for 10 minutes take a few 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.810
 sage leaves for flavor grind 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.769
 sage can be replaced with basil 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.760
 the sauce is almost the right consistency 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:20.050
 Salt add sage and after two three 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.000
 minutes can be taken from the heat 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.310
 if you want you can go blender 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.239
 to make the sauce uniform but as for me 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.160
 he is so good for pizza stuffing i take 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.630
 mozzarella 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.630
 cut into her like such round slices 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.160
 sweet pepper 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:49.300
 I cut straws still take such a pork 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.890
 I will cut garlic sausage with rings 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.810
 all as an example you can 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.510
 use products you like 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.239
 you or experiment at all 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.560
 well and since this is pizza burgers men 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:08.280
 ground beef alum freshly ground pepper 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 mix well 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:19.160
 now you need to make mini steaks like 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.860
 I see absolutely 3-4 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.020
 centimeter in diameter 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.470
 I think 8 pieces will be just right 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.930
 I put mini steaks on dough 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.410
 throughout the diameter while I left 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.280
 edge 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:41.350
 about 5 millimeters when everything is laid 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.420
 look here so stick around stuffing dough 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.760
 then put the dough between the joints 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.760
 thus forming Hamburg as it were 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.070
 each joint grease mustard Dijon 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.180
 It would not be superfluous to put pickled 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 cucumber but what have you forgotten about him and in general 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.060
 no his little pieces of cheddar cheese 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.340
 Well, now actually filling the pizza 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.530
 At first, do not lay down a lot of sauce 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.310
 one tablespoon can even slightly 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.310
 less sausage slices will be enough 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.650
 Sweet pepper 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.850
 and at the end of the mozzarella circles 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.780
 I recommend to bake on the lattice so pizza 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.420
 it will turn out just as it should 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.920
 the dough is perfectly baked and you are exactly 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.050
 be happy with the result 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:48.780
 and now in the oven for 20-25 minutes 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.910
 temperature is 200 degrees and here it is 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.080
 result 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.050
 nothing keeps a piece of good 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.340
 spreads and it's great see here 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.050
 you and pizza in the center and part with a burger 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.100
 looks nice tasty in my opinion 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.570
 very appetizing in general i try 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.840
 cook pizza burger share 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.380
 impressions wait for new recipes and to
