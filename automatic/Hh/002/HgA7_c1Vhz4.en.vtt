00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.870
 in fact it happened in the united states in 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.219
 the 1920s in chicago and it's a 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.129
 contractor called center 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.209
 who decided to go shopping so 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.380
 roller skates back then it's a 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.760
 little big fashion so it was on a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.689
 inclined track a bit like on the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.949
 velodromes me incidentally it was one 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.029
 velodromes it was races 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.839
 endurance but it was very long 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.980
 actually did every time he 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.749
 symbolized the distance between two 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.189
 American cities kind come see the 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.659
 to make new york cincinnati it lasted 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.679
 all day at the end of the race 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.200
 did they tend to give themselves 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.630
 strokes a little quietly to make 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.739
 to fall others and for that to 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.880
 to eliminate the best 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.840
 competitors like that in the end he 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.510
 already did not hurt that is eliminated from 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.800
 fatigue and we realized that the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.360
 public particularly liked 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.770
 moments when he will kick himself and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.270
 so they started a little adapted the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.450
 endurance race either men be 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.680
 women so giving by adding that 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.300
 in the rules we had a little bit 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.890
 the blows were allowed at the time 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.350
 stopped with the second war 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.910
 world and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.280
 and then it's a bit like a 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.039
 rebirth in the ' 60s 70 and in 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.009
 big it was a lot more folklo to 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.080
 the time it was with punches 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.460
 kicks there was no 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.390
 protection or almost you recognize 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.380
 the jammeuse because it's the one that 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 had a waouh helmet 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.799
 and it was very very hot scripted 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.060
 it was a bit like a wrestler 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.380
 she knew a little before what 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.600
 was going to win she repeated falls 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 a bit spectacular and so that's it 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.090
 ended up bored the public because good 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.710
 we can watch the catch as well 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.440
 for that and so it's dead of his beautiful 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.210
 died in the 70s 80 and for 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.700
 recognize a renaissance in 2001 to 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.380
 austin in texas where in fact it's a guy 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.909
 who said to himself that he can make 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.069
 the money in there by reviving 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.229
 the roller derby that he has found 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.850
 babes a little bit a little bit 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.009
 borderline turnips a little punk 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 a little rock etc and the weapons irene 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.130
 in a bar to create the first league 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.520
 of roller derby that he had created four 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.289
 teams 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.159
 he spotted the four strong heads he has 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.659
 said you will be captains of 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.830
 teams it's very, very teams 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.990
 themed then there were 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.369
 schoolgirls there were the cokers etc 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.039
 it was once again very very 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.259
 scripted what and so that a little walk 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.340
 but the same are very quickly realized 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.950
 that if they wanted it to be serious 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.659
 we had to get out a little 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.070
 from all sides catch all sides scripted 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.079
 all this a little grotesque side is 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.369
 really there girls got started 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.149
 together makes the type dropped them when 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.890
 he saw that it does not do enough 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.850
 money and it was going to be complicated 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.109
 to manage girls they have ten months 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.459
 but we like it so we're going to 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.630
 take it in hand and that's how 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.970
 it became really by the water 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.859
 skater sports and douich yourself and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.359
 those who realized that the 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.980
 system of thinking it to make of 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.480
 money would not work but that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 to have fun it works very 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660
 very well 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.909
 in fact the derby is very simple there is 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.290
 two teams 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.209
 so there are only five players each 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.680
 team on the track there are four 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.870
 each team that form a pack of 8 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.099
 blockers and there are two others 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.170
 it's the jams that have 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.549
 canvases on their helmets basically their purpose 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.690
 to it is to exceed the package of 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.230
 do tricks and re exceed 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.670
 pack etc 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.319
 and it's interesting because it's a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.879
 the only sports in the world we play 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.650
 attacked the defense simultaneously 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.209
 because at the same time in the pack 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.590
 we try to prevent opponent from 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.549
 pass because at each blockers 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.290
 that she passes she marks a point 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.819
 and at the same time to help his 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.049
 can use his shoulders from his 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.790
 hips and buttocks to give 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.500
 blocks so not elbows not hands 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.430
 no feet and there are areas where we 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.420
 does not have the aura to block in words 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.200
 blocked in the head we do not have the aura of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.810
 block around the spine 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.930
 and from the knee everything is articulated 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.730
 around the legality of the blocks and the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.720
 commitment zone because there has to be 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.680
 have a pack defined so that we have 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.090
 right does a number of things 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 if we're offside we do not have the right 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.780
 to help and there is a whole series of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.209
 penalties that may apply depending on 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 if we play legally or not so 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.440
 a penalty is a minute in prison
