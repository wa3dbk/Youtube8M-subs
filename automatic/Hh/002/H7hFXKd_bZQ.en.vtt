pretty<00:03:37.819> shocking<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.660> bearish<00:03:39.079> would<00:03:39.260> be

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
pretty shocking that bearish would be

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.349 
pretty shocking that bearish would be
the<00:03:39.530> shock<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.370> know<00:03:40.549> Frieza<00:03:41.030> would<00:03:41.239> be

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
the shock that you know Frieza would be

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.840 
the shock that you know Frieza would be
dead<00:03:41.540> because<00:03:42.470> here<00:03:42.859> you<00:03:42.950> have<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.400> many<00:03:43.489> other

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
dead because here you have so many other

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.420 
dead because here you have so many other
Dragon<00:03:44.720> Balls<00:03:44.870> even<00:03:44.989> after<00:03:45.829> freezer<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.400> a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
Dragon Balls even after freezer that a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.539 
Dragon Balls even after freezer that a
much<00:03:46.880> more<00:03:47.180> superior<00:03:47.540> than<00:03:47.720> him<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:49.130> guess

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
much more superior than him but I guess

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.319 
much more superior than him but I guess
you<00:03:49.670> can<00:03:49.819> say<00:03:50.030> freeze<00:03:50.840> up<00:03:51.109> has<00:03:51.970> some<00:03:52.970> sort<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
you can say freeze up has some sort of a

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.759 
you can say freeze up has some sort of a
mystery<00:03:53.690> behind<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.079> but<00:03:54.170> we<00:03:54.319> still<00:03:54.530> don't

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
mystery behind it but we still don't

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.240 
mystery behind it but we still don't
know<00:03:54.859> but<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:57.049> know<00:03:57.130> doesn't<00:03:58.130> make

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
focusing on freezer because that was

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.550 
focusing on freezer because that was
sort<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.850> tease<00:04:20.150> for<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.690> next<00:04:21.049> movie<00:04:21.349> there

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
around almost the same period of time

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.730

remember<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> movie<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.840> animation<00:04:51.410> of<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530
