00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.519
 now that we have 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.620
 60 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.680
 yes it 's a map 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.990
 not 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.330
 and what is this locality and not seen 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.090
 but still pay attention all the same to 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.020
 of the settlement so I hold on 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.020
 sit down 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.599
 60 I consider this site populated 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.590
 counts and ongoing that here 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.550
 still people then runs across the road and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 look at all the same she is named 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.670
 settlements priests are now studying 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.949
 other signs 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 rubber know what ends 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.340
 one way is not the first 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 I am mistaken now I would lizard handed it here 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.809
 circles if no priority signs 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.440
 this circle is regulated 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.380
 regulator in 2007 on November 6 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.570
 more expensive than someone in the circle that is, we 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:14.850
 Now we omit those who are in a circle by 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.320
 circle and translate 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.320
 it is very easy to make a mistake 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.689
 all working varieties by us while we wait for us 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.399
 can hit the back so I'll stop now! 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.009
 lower truck probably you too 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.420
 see he can you wait for us by bus 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.429
 go therefore not only on the road 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.530
 Look, but this one is all on this truck. 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.409
 this is no one sperm on the circle on the idea 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.329
 must miss us all why am i 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.520
 always say gender ideas our way 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.220
 because if someone didn't read 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.319
 traffic rules can you 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.720
 strike even when legally cool 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.799
 your pass pedestrian no vani on 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.060
 crosswalk 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.369
 a woman is not at a pedestrian crossing, I think 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 that here is 160 so here it is populated 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.520
 keep it going, work it easy 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.520
 rubbing you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.009
 Now the road is natural 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.170
 fixed here by level include not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.569
 need to turn I advise you always 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.340
 take the right variede but not quite 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.560
 snuggle curb when turning you 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.069
 can all pedestrian network which 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.069
 walking along the road 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280
 traffic light regulation 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.920
 green is on 5 out of 5 you want again 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.280
 Baku signal 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 we enter 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.709
 cuts us off 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.070
 on the left here the very soul in which which on 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.650
 circle already wanted to get into the second 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.110
 I know on brake 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.550
 the road to the delimiter it you have 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.270
 stood a man 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.210
 if a person is for some reason 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.140
 ran across the road in front of this truck 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:24.190
 614 british truck driver and 100 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.980
 cases in the ninety case of christ gave 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 If the role is not Xiang Xiang, she is right 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.860
 crush him he would be right if we 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.810
 near there would surely have hit us. 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.130
 10 like a good chess player it all 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.920
 provide good drive 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 that the road will go read it look 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.560
 put your foot on the brake that is not there 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.959
 for the sake of this black car on the right 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.599
 don't jump out 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.920
 looks at you valve patience and this one 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:04.030
 patience valve can burst and it can 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:09.129
 lie our famous and father-in-law and Judas 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.319
 these names of you have a bus view 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.189
 can stop in theory he should 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.470
 stop only on special 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.620
 bus stop and how we made 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.139
 he will usually stay where I tell him 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.419
 gone it is then so fly up to 20 kopecks 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.880
 how he usually hears like a bus driver 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.970
 Sasha words gone immediately give on the brakes 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.419
 right in the middle of the road and sharply gives 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.419
 right
