combat I didn't field as well really
performed<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.760> well<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.210> game<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.510> at

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
performed that well this game or at

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.700 
performed that well this game or at
least<00:00:24.750> he<00:00:24.840> didn't<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> biggest<00:00:25.439> impact

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
least he didn't have the biggest impact

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220 
least he didn't have the biggest impact
just<00:00:26.519> lamed<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.240> never<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.720> roamed<00:00:28.019> at

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
just lamed and never really roamed at

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
just lamed and never really roamed at
all<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.400> maybe<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> even<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.510> him

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
all I would maybe like to even see him

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
all I would maybe like to even see him
play<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> more<00:00:31.199> aggressive<00:00:31.500> liner<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.130> he<00:00:32.219> could

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
play a more aggressive liner so he could

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
play a more aggressive liner so he could
have<00:00:32.460> helped<00:00:32.790> diamond<00:00:33.270> secure<00:00:33.719> kills<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
have helped diamond secure kills and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.720 
have helped diamond secure kills and
objectives<00:00:34.710> around<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> map<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.579> did<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
objectives around the map what did you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.770 
objectives around the map what did you
think<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> build<00:00:36.360> because<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.690> were

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
think of the build because we were

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060 
think of the build because we were
watching<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.200> together<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> called

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
watching it together and you called

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.590 
watching it together and you called
maybe<00:00:38.309> he<00:00:38.460> should<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> trendy<00:00:39.120> forcing<00:00:39.480> me

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
maybe he should get a trendy forcing me

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
maybe he should get a trendy forcing me
some<00:00:39.780> damage<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.140> he<00:00:40.320> went<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> iceberg

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.439 
game I would have preferred to see a
Trinity<00:00:56.280> force<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.610> don't<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
Trinity force I don't think there was a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.360 
Trinity force I don't think there was a
need<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> nice<00:00:58.109> boring<00:00:58.379> gauntlets<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
need for a nice boring gauntlets in this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.450 
need for a nice boring gauntlets in this
game<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.120> wasn't<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.690> poke<00:01:01.020> focused<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
game it wasn't to poke focused so the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
game it wasn't to poke focused so the
slow<00:01:02.820> didn't<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.359> set<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> too<00:01:04.350> much

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
slow didn't really set up in too much

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
slow didn't really set up in too much
and<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.700> training<00:01:05.909> force<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.360> added

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and the training force would have added

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
and the training force would have added
a<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.840> damage<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.350> especially<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
a bit more damage and especially bit of

opponents with like pics that they don't

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.809 
opponents with like pics that they don't

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
changes throughout the the problem

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.970

surrounding<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.349> team<00:02:58.500> they're<00:02:58.739> still<00:02:58.950> there

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980

nothing<00:02:59.760> has<00:02:59.910> been<00:02:59.940> really<00:03:00.390> fixed<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.840> that's

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
nothing has been really fixed and that's

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.330 
nothing has been really fixed and that's
why<00:03:01.079> they're<00:03:01.260> looking<00:03:01.620> further<00:03:01.829> now<00:03:02.129> they're

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
why they're looking further now they're

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160 
why they're looking further now they're
trying<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.239> Kevin<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.810> make<00:03:03.989> some

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
trying to get in Kevin and make some

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.440 
trying to get in Kevin and make some
more<00:03:04.290> changes<00:03:04.609> you<00:03:05.609> said<00:03:05.879> before<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.269> you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.599 
more changes you said before that you
thought<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> Kevin<00:03:07.319> would<00:03:07.829> change<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
thought that the Kevin would change a

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.220 
thought that the Kevin would change a
dynamic<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.420> team<00:03:09.629> coming<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.019> there

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
dynamic in that team coming in there

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.229 
dynamic in that team coming in there
with<00:03:10.379> a<00:03:10.410> loss<00:03:10.799> like<00:03:11.069> they<00:03:11.250> suffer<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:11.790> today

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
with a loss like they suffer that today

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.759 
with a loss like they suffer that today
how<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:13.049> they<00:03:13.170> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.620> come<00:03:13.739> back

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
how are they going to have to come back

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.830 
how are they going to have to come back

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
from that well it's definitely a bit of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.659 
from that well it's definitely a bit of
a<00:03:15.930> mental<00:03:16.290> blow<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.799> they<00:03:17.099> were<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.489> far

like<00:03:25.319> that<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.709> was<00:03:25.889> really<00:03:26.190> defeating

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
like that it was really defeating

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.390

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
bit of a mental blah but I think they'll

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.220 
bit of a mental blah but I think they'll
realize<00:03:33.209> they<00:03:33.389> did<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.720> well<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.079> game

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
there's so many good things the loss is

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.509

the split they've actually surprised me

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:12.710

with how good their team playing
communication<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:14.239> especially<00:04:15.239> because<00:04:15.540> they

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
communication is especially because they

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.150 
communication is especially because they
have<00:04:15.750> two<00:04:15.870> foreigners<00:04:16.289> they<00:04:16.349> do<00:04:16.859> manage<00:04:17.010> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
have two foreigners they do manage to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.250
