 of the equivalent of the surface and which 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.940

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 can be to surpass the goal 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.780
 Austrian 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.880
 the other scales that reduce the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.360
 mark in the 55th minute of play by sarah

 stop date sarah bouhaddi but we knew 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.220
 that it was going to be a very tough match 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.360
 complicated because technically it's 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.670
 a team that plays very well 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.989
 it's a team that is very very very 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.540
 physical and by doing us a pressing 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.940

 to punctuate for the match even if 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.739
 sometimes we have a few 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.430
 small absences that will take eight 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.430
