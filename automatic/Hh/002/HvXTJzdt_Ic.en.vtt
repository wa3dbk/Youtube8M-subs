around 700 rounds per minute we got

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.930 
around 700 rounds per minute we got
around<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.020> 670<00:02:39.920> area<00:02:40.250> originally<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.820> had

around the 670 area originally I had

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.030 
around the 670 area originally I had

krona dit in around the 700 rounds per
minute<00:02:43.160> area<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.790> guess<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.480> dumbed<00:02:44.870> down

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
minute area I guess it just dumbed down

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.080 
minute area I guess it just dumbed down
a<00:02:45.140> little<00:02:45.410> bit<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:45.800> still<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.910> decent

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
a little bit but still that's a decent

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.180 
a little bit but still that's a decent
respectable<00:02:47.780> rate<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.230> fire<00:02:48.410> certainly<00:02:49.010> not

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
respectable rate of fire certainly not

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.800 
respectable rate of fire certainly not
the<00:02:49.370> highest<00:02:49.580> certainly<00:02:50.120> not<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.390> best<00:02:50.600> but

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
the highest certainly not the best but

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.680 
the highest certainly not the best but
in<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.560> end<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.010> respectable<00:02:52.670> rounds<00:02:53.540> per

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
in the end it's respectable rounds per

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.480 
in the end it's respectable rounds per
second<00:02:54.050> same<00:02:54.290> thing<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.680> around<00:02:54.890> eleven<00:02:55.280> point

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
second same thing in around eleven point

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.640 
second same thing in around eleven point
two<00:02:55.700> rounds<00:02:56.120> per<00:02:56.270> second<00:02:56.690> it's<00:02:57.050> respectable

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
two rounds per second it's respectable

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.310 
two rounds per second it's respectable
not<00:02:58.190> great<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:59.000> not<00:02:59.180> bad<00:02:59.240> at<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.870> same<00:03:00.080> time

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
not great but not bad at the same time

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.440 
not great but not bad at the same time
so<00:03:00.560> maybe<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.860> suggested<00:03:01.490> upgrade<00:03:01.880> would<00:03:02.300> be

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
so maybe a suggested upgrade would be

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.000 
so maybe a suggested upgrade would be
upgrade<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.960> motor<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.530> thing<00:03:03.740> give<00:03:03.920> you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
upgrade the motor on this thing give you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.460 
upgrade the motor on this thing give you
a<00:03:04.040> little<00:03:04.190> bit<00:03:04.280> better<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.820> rate<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.000> fire

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
a little bit better of a rate of fire

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.410 
a little bit better of a rate of fire
