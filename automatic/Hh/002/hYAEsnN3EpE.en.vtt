 been seeing that they had recipes 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 healthy but I'm still 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080

 a lot and let's see how it's done we're going to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 start with the palettes of pay 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.370
 lemons let's use 397 grams of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 condensed milk 378 grams of milk 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.329
 evaporated the juice of seven lemons 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 molds or glasses and ten cookies Mary 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.870
 milled 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.190
 let's start by putting everything in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.560
 of the blender evaporated milk 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 then the condensed milk and at the end 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.430
 the juice of the lemons can also 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 add lemon maker so that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.600
 have a little texture 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.700
 Y 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.220
 let's grind it until it looks good 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.750
 mixed 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.090
 when you have more or less this 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520
 consistency is ready 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.920
 then we will empty it on our 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.390
 furniture you can make cookies from 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.289
 sizes you want and also from the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.289
 shapes that you want 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 after we sticks and are 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.800
 we're going to refrigerate them for at least 6 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800
 hours 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.680
 once 6 hours have passed we are going to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.180
 use a little warm water and let's 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.050
 submerge the paddles so that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.050
 take off very well 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.120
 later, since they are ready, we are going to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.340
 pass over the cookie and seriously in 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.520
 serious this is the richest do not have to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.520
 do 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.959
 and so is the end our bags 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.959
 i 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.600
 now let's make some pizza bites 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.380
 let's use pizza dough now 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.300
 prepared pepperoni to taste cheese al 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.360
 taste tomato sauce 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.520
 Oregano and black pepper 2 tablespoons 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.480
 Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon of oil 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.670
 vegetable 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.890
 let's preheat the oven to 207 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.160
 degrees centigrade 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.200
 this is the afterlife if it leaves package 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.350
 we will give a ball of dough 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 small let's put on cheese and 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.280
 after the pepero 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.050
 then we will close it in a way 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.790
 envelope 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.790
 that is more or less like a bun 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.880
 i 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 once you have all your balls 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.510
 you are going to grease the container very well 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.939
 where are we going to cook them 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.129
 you put them all and on top you're going to put 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.110
 a little butter each one also 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.140
 you're going to put some oregano very very 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.300
 little bit like that they are more or less 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.300
 we're going to bake it for 16 minutes 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.480
 for tomato sauce in a saucepan 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.690
 let's put some butter 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.540

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.879
 little Parmesan cheese the oregano and the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.959
 black pepper let's boil 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.459
 for two or three minutes and that's it 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.459
 also so to our pizza bites 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.709
 when you open them seriously the most 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.209
 rich then you can submerge them inside 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.209
 of the tomato sauce and that's it 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.730
