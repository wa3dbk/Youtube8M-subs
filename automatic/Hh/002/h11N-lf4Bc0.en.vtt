00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
you can swing this really fast that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.120 
you can swing this really fast that
which<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.690> uh<00:03:01.870> which<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:02.650> awesome<00:03:02.769> but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
which is uh which is pretty awesome but

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.580 
which is uh which is pretty awesome but
it<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.370> very<00:03:03.459> thin<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.299> isn't<00:03:05.049> as<00:03:05.170> big<00:03:05.410> as<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
it is very thin it isn't as big as a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.949 
it is very thin it isn't as big as a
roller<00:03:05.890> clearly<00:03:06.549> as<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.730> guys<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:07.060> see<00:03:07.120> but

somebody<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.660> just<00:03:13.720> did<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.230> he<00:03:14.920> got<00:03:15.100> me<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
somebody like I just did but he got me I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.840 
somebody like I just did but he got me I
got<00:03:15.400> him<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:16.950> wonder<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:18.250> better<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.700> just

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
got him I wonder if it's better to just

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.430 
got him I wonder if it's better to just
spam<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.950> think<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.100> might<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> case

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
spam it I think that might be the case

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.620 
spam it I think that might be the case
look<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.940> cover<00:03:24.940> more<00:03:25.180> ground<00:03:25.209> like<00:03:25.600> that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
look at that cover more ground like that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.620 
look at that cover more ground like that
probably<00:03:26.760> probably<00:03:27.760> waste<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.239> little<00:03:28.359> more

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
probably probably waste a little more

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.809 
probably probably waste a little more
ink<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.019> way<00:03:29.200> but<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.850> be<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> nope

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.589 

oh<00:03:33.909> he<00:03:34.840> got<00:03:34.989> me<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.379> was<00:03:36.219> gonna<00:03:36.340> try<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.730> spamming

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
oh he got me I was gonna try to spamming

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.239 
oh he got me I was gonna try to spamming
with<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.079> yeah<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.409> this<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.129> very

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:39.249 
with it but yeah you can this is very

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.220 
with it but yeah you can this is very
different<00:03:39.549> than<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.060> ink<00:03:40.659> roller<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.989> thought

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
different than the ink roller I thought

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.300 
different than the ink roller I thought
it<00:03:41.290> would<00:03:41.349> be<00:03:41.469> a<00:03:41.499> little<00:03:41.650> more<00:03:41.799> similar<00:03:42.159> but

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
it would be a little more similar but

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.699 
it would be a little more similar but
it's<00:03:43.299> similar<00:03:43.540> pretty<00:03:44.079> much<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.469> sense

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
it's similar pretty much in the sense

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's similar pretty much in the sense
that<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.859> just<00:03:45.040> roll<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.400> on<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.549> floor

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
that you just roll it on the floor

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.179 
that you just roll it on the floor
that's<00:03:45.939> pretty<00:03:46.510> much<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.689> I<00:03:47.139> don't<00:03:47.980> know<00:03:48.040> how

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
that's pretty much it I don't know how

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.640 
that's pretty much it I don't know how
well<00:03:48.400> we're<00:03:48.549> going<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.849> here<00:03:48.879> with

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
think we're winning but we're actually

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.680 
think we're winning but we're actually
doing<00:04:21.310> better<00:04:21.459> than<00:04:21.729> I<00:04:21.820> thought<00:04:22.090> we<00:04:22.330> would<00:04:22.509> do

of<00:05:26.650> spamming<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.190> like<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:28.690> think

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
of spamming it like that and I think

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.330 
of spamming it like that and I think
that's<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.169> only<00:05:29.199> way<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.590> can<00:05:29.830> really<00:05:29.889> kill
