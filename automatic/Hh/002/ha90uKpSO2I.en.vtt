00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
but we have the hot glue works the best

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
but we have the hot glue works the best
you're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.100> line<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:09.479> edge<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you're going to line up this edge so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.310 
you're going to line up this edge so
that<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> looks<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:13.049> goes<00:01:13.260> right

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that it looks like it goes right

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.730 
that it looks like it goes right
together<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.470> glue<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
together like that so you put glue on

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
together like that so you put glue on
that<00:01:17.100> inside<00:01:17.430> edge<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.689> would<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.930> really

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that inside edge and it would be really

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 
that inside edge and it would be really
nice<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.710> hot<00:01:23.100> glue<00:01:23.280> gun<00:01:23.369> had<00:01:23.759> Clute<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
gonna do thin line down Wow there's my

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.300 
gonna do thin line down Wow there's my
hot<00:01:44.759> glue<00:01:44.909> let's<00:01:45.180> try<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.420> again

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.719 

so<00:01:53.150> you're<00:01:53.299> going<00:01:53.540> down<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.750> outer<00:01:54.110> edge<00:01:54.350> and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.280 

this<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.970> thin<00:01:59.210> line<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.750> don't<00:01:59.810> support

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
this is a thin line so you don't support

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.999 
this is a thin line so you don't support
it<00:02:00.409> out<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.770> burn<00:02:00.890> yourself<00:02:02.650> as<00:02:03.650> we've<00:02:03.860> all

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
it out and burn yourself as we've all

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.060 
it out and burn yourself as we've all
done<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.369> way<00:02:04.520> too<00:02:04.700> many<00:02:04.820> times<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.770> fold

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
done that way too many times so you fold

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.949 
done that way too many times so you fold
it<00:02:07.190> over<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.840> stick<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.289> down<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
it over and you stick it down so that

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:20.949 
it over and you stick it down so that
that<00:02:12.380> edge<00:02:12.560> goes<00:02:12.890> right<00:02:13.280> into<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> crease<00:02:19.959> I'm

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
that edge goes right into the crease I'm

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.040 
that edge goes right into the crease I'm
going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.530> more<00:02:21.680> line<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.010> glue<00:02:23.050> on

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
going to do one more line of glue on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:35.080 
going to do one more line of glue on
this<00:02:24.290> outside<00:02:24.530> edge

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.089 

and<00:02:35.180> then<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> tricky<00:02:36.319> part<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.890> be

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
and then the tricky part is going to be

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.430 
and then the tricky part is going to be
the<00:02:37.250> bottom<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.810> you're<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.080> do<00:02:39.260> is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the bottom so what you're going to do is

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.800 
the bottom so what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:39.590> going<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.860> pull<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.030> side<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.540> first

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
you're going to pull this side in first

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.650 
you're going to pull this side in first
that<00:02:42.080> doesn't<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.920> tabs<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.660> then

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that doesn't have the tabs and then

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.500 
that doesn't have the tabs and then
you're<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.200> put<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> line<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.069> glue

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you're going to put a line of glue

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.369 
you're going to put a line of glue
across<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:50.360> actually<00:02:50.540> might<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:50.900> better<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
across it it actually might be better to

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.710 
across it it actually might be better to
stick<00:02:51.560> your<00:02:51.739> tabs<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.099> before<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.640> glue<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.030> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
stick your tabs in before you glue it so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.059 
stick your tabs in before you glue it so
you're<00:02:53.930> gonna<00:02:54.049> stick<00:02:54.260> these<00:02:54.440> tabs<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
you're gonna stick these tabs in the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:05.949 
you're gonna stick these tabs in the
sides<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:02.830> push<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:04.010> down<00:03:04.540> now<00:03:05.540> once<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
