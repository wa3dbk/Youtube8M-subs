00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.000 

eventually<00:02:26.780> they<00:02:27.170> come<00:02:27.380> back<00:02:27.590> stuff<00:02:27.890> like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
we're messing around with under there

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.830 
we're messing around with under there
we'll<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.790> see<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.150> shakes<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
we'll have to see what shakes out and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.410 
we'll have to see what shakes out and
ends<00:02:32.959> up<00:02:33.019> sticking<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.099> we<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:34.760> plan<00:02:35.000> for<00:02:35.239> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
ends up sticking but we do plan for to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.460 
ends up sticking but we do plan for to
be<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.720> different<00:02:35.930> we're<00:02:36.230> also<00:02:36.349> thinking

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
be a bit different we're also thinking

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.370 
be a bit different we're also thinking
about<00:02:36.800> having<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.340> road<00:02:38.269> or<00:02:38.510> own<00:02:38.810> band<00:02:39.200> up

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
about having the the road or own band up

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.559 
about having the the road or own band up
down<00:02:39.560> there<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.880> thought<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.330> was<00:02:41.420> pretty

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
down there and I thought that was pretty

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.170 
down there and I thought that was pretty
cool<00:02:41.870> because<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:43.459> garba<00:02:43.730> she<00:02:43.910> read<00:02:44.060> is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
cool because the garba she read is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.580 
cool because the garba she read is
really<00:02:44.510> awesome<00:02:44.660> but<00:02:44.959> not<00:02:45.049> enough<00:02:45.200> people<00:02:45.410> go

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
really awesome but not enough people go

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.850 
really awesome but not enough people go
