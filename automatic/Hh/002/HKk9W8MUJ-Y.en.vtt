raised chickens they too are always on
grass<00:00:14.210> we<00:00:14.509> moved<00:00:14.719> them<00:00:14.870> to<00:00:15.080> fresh<00:00:15.320> grass<00:00:15.559> every

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
grass we moved them to fresh grass every

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.890 
grass we moved them to fresh grass every
day<00:00:16.160> they<00:00:16.340> have<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.520> lot<00:00:16.849> of<00:00:16.880> opportunity<00:00:17.750> to

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
day they have a lot of opportunity to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.429 
day they have a lot of opportunity to
move<00:00:18.050> around<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:19.550> we<00:00:19.759> have<00:00:19.880> pastured<00:00:20.779> eggs<00:00:20.899> so

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
move around and we have pastured eggs so

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.920 
move around and we have pastured eggs so
our<00:00:21.649> chickens<00:00:22.040> in<00:00:22.640> via<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.180> egg<00:00:23.329> mobile<00:00:23.750> are

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
our chickens in via the egg mobile are

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.740 
our chickens in via the egg mobile are
always<00:00:24.410> on<00:00:24.770> grass<00:00:24.980> they<00:00:25.820> are<00:00:26.029> actually<00:00:26.480> right

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
always on grass they are actually right

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.540 
always on grass they are actually right
the<00:00:26.960> cattle<00:00:27.320> graze<00:00:27.529> off<00:00:27.770> a<00:00:27.800> little<00:00:28.070> bit<00:00:28.279> and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the cattle graze off a little bit and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.760 
the cattle graze off a little bit and
then<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.360> chickens<00:00:29.720> follow<00:00:29.989> in<00:00:30.230> behind<00:00:30.380> them

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
then the chickens follow in behind them

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.560 
then the chickens follow in behind them
now<00:00:31.009> that's<00:00:31.340> that's<00:00:31.669> normal<00:00:32.180> that's<00:00:32.300> what<00:00:32.480> you

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
now that's that's normal that's what you

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.510 
now that's that's normal that's what you
find<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:32.960> nature<00:00:33.140> right<00:00:33.680> that<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.219> what<00:00:34.399> you

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
find in nature right that is what you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.250 
find in nature right that is what you
find<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:34.910> nature<00:00:35.030> ok<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.690> then<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.050> you

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
find in nature ok and then so and you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.130 
find in nature ok and then so and you
clarify<00:00:36.830> this<00:00:37.070> as<00:00:37.340> you<00:00:38.120> call<00:00:38.360> it<00:00:38.510> pasture<00:00:38.930> fed

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
clarify this as you call it pasture fed

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.470 
clarify this as you call it pasture fed
yeah<00:00:39.440> chickens<00:00:40.040> fast<00:00:40.370> you're<00:00:40.550> raised<00:00:40.730> yeah<00:00:41.030> ok

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
yeah chickens fast you're raised yeah ok

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.000 
yeah chickens fast you're raised yeah ok
and<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.110> difference<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.650> mean<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.830> lot<00:00:42.980> of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
and the difference I mean a lot of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.790 
and the difference I mean a lot of
people<00:00:43.130> think<00:00:43.550> would<00:00:43.730> they<00:00:43.820> want<00:00:44.800> free-range

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
people think would they want free-range

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.980 
people think would they want free-range
for<00:00:46.250> example<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.760> legal<00:00:47.330> definition<00:00:47.900> of

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
for example the legal definition of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.990 
for example the legal definition of
free-range<00:00:48.260> is<00:00:48.650> meaningless<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.730> legal

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
free-range is meaningless it the legal

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.750 
free-range is meaningless it the legal
definition<00:00:50.329> under<00:00:50.810> USDA<00:00:51.320> rules<00:00:51.680> say<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.010> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
definition under USDA rules say that the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.910 
definition under USDA rules say that the
chickens<00:00:53.150> must<00:00:53.360> be<00:00:53.480> given<00:00:53.810> access<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
chickens must be given access to the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280 
chickens must be given access to the
outside<00:00:55.340> for<00:00:55.700> 15<00:00:55.850> minutes<00:00:56.420> a<00:00:56.510> day<00:00:56.690> that's<00:00:57.110> it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
outside for 15 minutes a day that's it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.040 
outside for 15 minutes a day that's it
that's<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.950> so<00:00:58.250> after<00:00:58.400> 6<00:00:58.970> weeks<00:00:59.150> or<00:00:59.420> 16<00:00:59.810> weeks

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
that's it so after 6 weeks or 16 weeks

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.120 
that's it so after 6 weeks or 16 weeks
when<00:01:00.200> they<00:01:00.290> have<00:01:00.440> enough<00:01:00.650> feathers<00:01:01.010> to

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
when they have enough feathers to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.290 
when they have enough feathers to
actually<00:01:01.400> go<00:01:01.520> out<00:01:01.640> into<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.030> sunlight

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
actually go out into the sunlight

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.819 
actually go out into the sunlight
because<00:01:02.720> they<00:01:02.810> are<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.170> brooder<00:01:03.470> house<00:01:03.620> in

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
because they are in a brooder house in

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.259 
because they are in a brooder house in
the<00:01:03.890> beginning<00:01:04.159> well<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:04.909> actually<00:01:05.030> have

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
the beginning well they actually have

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.960 
the beginning well they actually have
enough<00:01:05.770> feathers<00:01:06.770> when<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.159> door<00:01:07.340> opens<00:01:07.759> for

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
enough feathers when that door opens for

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.240 
enough feathers when that door opens for
those<00:01:08.060> 15<00:01:08.450> minutes<00:01:08.630> exactly<00:01:08.930> zero<00:01:09.710> chickens

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
those 15 minutes exactly zero chickens

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.399 
those 15 minutes exactly zero chickens
go<00:01:10.400> outside<00:01:10.790> because<00:01:11.120> they're<00:01:11.960> afraid<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.260> the

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
go outside because they're afraid of the

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.630 
go outside because they're afraid of the
outside<00:01:12.560> they've<00:01:12.920> been<00:01:13.040> inside<00:01:13.310> their<00:01:13.520> whole

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
outside they've been inside their whole

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.300 
outside they've been inside their whole
lives<00:01:13.820> right<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.409> truth<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:15.950> most

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
lives right so the truth is that most

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.550 
lives right so the truth is that most
free-range<00:01:17.240> birds<00:01:17.540> have<00:01:17.840> never<00:01:18.020> even<00:01:18.140> seen<00:01:18.530> a

blade of grass let alone eat more
