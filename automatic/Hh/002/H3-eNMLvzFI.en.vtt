00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.440
 PLANNING By planning well, you get the most out of your kitchen. 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.480
 Here are some simple things to keep in mind. 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.040
 You must be able to move easily from the cooking zone 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 -to the fridge and the sink. This is called the working triangle. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 The shape of the kitchen is determined by the shape of the room, 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.720
 but that does not mean that your new kitchen must have the same shape. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760
 Some options: 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.600
 A kitchen in one line is good for small kitchens, but not for larger rooms. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 You can add an island. That not only gives you more storage space, 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.600
 but can also serve as a serving area, as a nice place to meet or as a room divider. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040
 An L-shaped kitchen provides a good working triangle 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 -and offers a lot of storage space. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
 A U-shaped kitchen gives you loads of storage and worktop space. 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 But you do need a large space for it. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.880
 A parallel kitchen offers you double work zones on opposite walls. 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.280
 You don't need much space for it and it works well with a door at the end. 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.480
 With space on both sides of the hob you can always go somewhere with your hot pans. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.760
 If you have too little space, focus on the space between the sink and the hob. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 There must be enough space in a parallel kitchen so that two people can work there. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.600
 You need a distance of 120 cm between kitchen doors facing each other. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.480
 Make sure that the cabinets do not obstruct the overview of the countertops. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 Follow the manufacturer's recommendations 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040
 -to determine the height of the extractor hood. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.960
 If you mount your oven at eye level, you don't have to bend down as much and little children can't touch it. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.960
 And with worktop space next to the oven, you always have a place for those hot baking trays. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.760
 Store your kitchen utensils, pots and pans close to the hob so that you always have them with you. 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.000
 You better place your glasses, cutlery and crockery close to the dishwasher. 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
 -to easily load and unload it. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 With a fitting between the cabinet and the wall 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 -make sure that the door can be opened completely. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 This is especially important when you use pull-out wire baskets. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.520
 You shouldn't do this: If you place the oven or the dishwasher in a corner- 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.440
 -You can no longer open the adjacent drawers and cupboard doors. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 Putting a sink against the wall disrupts your workflow. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.320
 If you install the oven against a wall, the wall may be damaged by heat. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.840
 With drawers in a corner, you can no longer open the adjacent cupboard, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
 and they may even damage the door or handle. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 Much to think about? 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 The online kitchen planner helps you on your way, and when you place your order, 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.240
 a kitchen expert will look at your design together with you, 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.040
 so you don't just have a kitchen that looks great, 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 but especially one that also works very well.
