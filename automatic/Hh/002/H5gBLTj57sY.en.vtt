you see how this edge and this edge

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.449 
you see how this edge and this edge
matched<00:03:13.900> each<00:03:14.350> other

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459

now I'll put this way

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.100 
now I'll put this way

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you poured out try to match this edge to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:48.300 
you poured out try to match this edge to
this<00:03:42.030> at<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.840> point<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.130> create<00:03:46.590> 2y<00:03:47.590> and

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
this at this point you can create 2y and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.270 
this at this point you can create 2y and
agudo<00:03:49.140> again<00:03:50.400> begin<00:03:51.450> stun<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.830> will<00:03:54.100> show

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.730 

okay<00:04:13.850> then<00:04:14.240> you<00:04:14.390> repeat<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.870> same<00:04:15.050> step<00:04:15.410> with

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
okay then you repeat the same step with

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:24.140 
okay then you repeat the same step with
your<00:04:16.459> other<00:04:16.549> cycle

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:35.559 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:40.319 

so<00:04:36.369> go<00:04:36.699> back<00:04:36.939> to<00:04:37.359> the<00:04:37.659> statute<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:39.789> last<00:04:40.029> step

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:40.329 
so go back to the statute the last step

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:42.149 
so go back to the statute the last step
you<00:04:40.359> have<00:04:40.599> evolving<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.349> before<00:04:41.769> you<00:04:41.919> actually

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
you have evolving it before you actually

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.749 
you have evolving it before you actually
created<00:04:42.849> wings<00:04:43.169> just<00:04:44.169> go<00:04:44.349> back<00:04:44.619> to<00:04:45.309> last<00:04:45.519> step

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
created wings just go back to last step

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.899 
created wings just go back to last step
this<00:04:45.969> is<00:04:46.029> what<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.509> have<00:04:46.719> so<00:04:46.959> far<00:04:46.989> and<00:04:47.859> then<00:04:48.609> I

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
this is what you have so far and then I

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.529 
this is what you have so far and then I
just<00:04:49.479> try<00:04:49.809> to<00:04:49.839> match<00:04:50.259> you<00:04:50.679> CD<00:04:51.069> to<00:04:51.909> deploy<00:04:52.299> in

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
just try to match you CD to deploy in

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.439 
just try to match you CD to deploy in
the<00:04:52.569> corner<00:04:53.019> here<00:04:53.259> a<00:04:53.439> much<00:04:54.039> this<00:04:54.279> corner<00:04:54.729> to

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
the corner here a much this corner to

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.820 
the corner here a much this corner to
this<00:04:55.569> edge

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.600 

they're<00:04:59.430> repeat<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.879> same<00:05:00.120> step

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
they're repeat the same step

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.070 
they're repeat the same step
and<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:01.789> others<00:05:02.530> and

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and the others and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.969 
and the others and
and<00:05:04.650> annex<00:05:05.069> I<00:05:05.870> would<00:05:06.870> estimate<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.650> half

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
and annex I would estimate of a half

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.370 
and annex I would estimate of a half
inch<00:05:08.189> from<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:09.479> edge<00:05:09.659> here

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.950 

in<00:05:13.370> three<00:05:13.970> distinguished

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.140 

you<00:05:19.650> can<00:05:19.830> get<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.160> sitter

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.240 

so<00:05:26.150> now<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.600> a<00:05:26.630> cuter<00:05:27.140> that's<00:05:27.800> when<00:05:28.100> you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
so now you have a cuter that's when you

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.650 
so now you have a cuter that's when you
can<00:05:28.400> play<00:05:28.580> outside<00:05:29.170> if<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:30.410> pretty<00:05:30.650> far<00:05:31.010> as<00:05:31.130> well

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
can play outside if I pretty far as well

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.629 
can play outside if I pretty far as well
here's<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.810> start<00:05:34.120> very<00:05:35.120> fast<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:35.630> far<00:05:35.870> too

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
here's the start very fast and far too

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.700 
here's the start very fast and far too
check<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.419> out<00:05:39.129> and<00:05:40.129> if<00:05:40.310> today<00:05:40.879> the<00:05:41.270> paper<00:05:41.810> Evan
