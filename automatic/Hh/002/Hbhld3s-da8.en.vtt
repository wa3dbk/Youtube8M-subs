that
I<00:06:34.970> into<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.690> your<00:06:35.810> color<00:06:36.020> just<00:06:36.170> looks<00:06:36.320> more

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
vibrant and shiny another tip is to

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.990 
vibrant and shiny another tip is to
actually<00:06:38.720> wash<00:06:39.080> your<00:06:39.290> hair<00:06:39.500> in<00:06:39.650> cool<00:06:40.340> to<00:06:40.700> cold

actually wash your hair in cool to cold

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.360 
actually wash your hair in cool to cold
water<00:06:41.240> it<00:06:41.660> actually<00:06:42.170> helps<00:06:42.650> a<00:06:42.710> lot<00:06:43.040> when<00:06:43.250> it

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
water it actually helps a lot when it

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.070 
water it actually helps a lot when it
comes<00:06:43.580> to<00:06:43.790> keeping<00:06:44.120> color<00:06:44.660> in<00:06:44.900> your<00:06:45.020> hair

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
comes to keeping color in your hair

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.960 
comes to keeping color in your hair
because<00:06:45.650> when<00:06:45.740> you<00:06:45.830> use<00:06:45.920> hot<00:06:46.160> water<00:06:46.400> it<00:06:46.640> opens

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
because when you use hot water it opens

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.390 
because when you use hot water it opens
up<00:06:47.090> all<00:06:47.270> the<00:06:47.510> follicles<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:48.400> scientifical

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
up all the follicles and scientifical

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.310 
up all the follicles and scientifical
things<00:06:49.670> in<00:06:50.120> your<00:06:50.360> hair<00:06:50.570> and<00:06:50.780> your<00:06:50.930> color<00:06:51.140> just
