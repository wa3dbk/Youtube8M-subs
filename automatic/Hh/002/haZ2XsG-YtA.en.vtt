00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
foundation which I absolutely loved it
was<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.980> inexpensive<00:00:36.350> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.760> ran<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
was very inexpensive but I ran out so I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.410 
was very inexpensive but I ran out so I
don't<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.920> mattifying<00:00:41.399> foundation<00:00:41.730> at

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.279 
don't have the mattifying foundation at
this<00:00:42.629> point<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.700> thought<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
this point so I just thought of a way to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.270 
this point so I just thought of a way to
make<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
make it the thing is because here in the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.630 
make it the thing is because here in the
Netherlands<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:52.289> only<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.160> brands

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
Netherlands we only have like brands

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810 
Netherlands we only have like brands
such<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.820> Mac<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> Bobby<00:00:54.809> Brown<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.430> are

such as Mac and Bobby Brown and they are
very<00:00:57.449> expensive<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:59.239> I<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.600> thought<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
very expensive so I just thought of a
