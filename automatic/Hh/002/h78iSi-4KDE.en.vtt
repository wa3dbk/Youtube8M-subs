00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
know we didn't concede a goal we
basically<00:00:41.520> walked<00:00:41.850> into<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> qualifiers<00:00:42.600> and

exciting you know I'm one of the first
times<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.750> everyone<00:01:55.560> who's<00:01:55.740> turned<00:01:55.920> up

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
times I think everyone who's turned up

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.649 
times I think everyone who's turned up
as<00:01:56.219> stayed<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> quite<00:01:56.969> surprising<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
as stayed which is quite surprising so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.420 
as stayed which is quite surprising so
there's<00:01:58.079> millions<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.560> Australians<00:01:58.950> stuff

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
there's millions of Australians stuff

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
there's millions of Australians stuff
and<00:01:59.670> everyone's<00:02:00.360> vying<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.810> spot<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and everyone's vying for that spot and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
and everyone's vying for that spot and
it's<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.710> quite<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.040> clear<00:02:02.280> who's<00:02:02.460> playing

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it's not quite as clear who's playing

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.770 
it's not quite as clear who's playing
and<00:02:02.939> who's<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.689> think

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and who's doing what so I think

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
and who's doing what so I think
everyone's<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.409> focused<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.790> know

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
everyone's really focused and you know

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.950 
everyone's really focused and you know
just<00:02:06.030> looking<00:02:06.210> forward<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> game<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
obviously with it with it being a local

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.390 
obviously with it with it being a local
local<00:02:09.869> derbies<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.530> much<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.890> international

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
local derbies as much as international

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.830 
local derbies as much as international
can<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:11.819> makes<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> bit<00:02:12.300> more

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
