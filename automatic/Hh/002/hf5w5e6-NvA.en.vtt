00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
sledgehammer so I I can't imagine that

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.270 
sledgehammer so I I can't imagine that
they<00:02:38.420> will<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:38.959> don't<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.260> maybe<00:02:39.590> Activision

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
they will I don't know maybe Activision

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.680 
they will I don't know maybe Activision
makes<00:02:40.459> treyarch<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.150> know<00:02:41.239> pour<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.659> over

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
makes treyarch you know pour that over

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.550 
makes treyarch you know pour that over
but<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:43.280> think<00:02:44.060> dude<00:02:44.420> mw3<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.260> going<00:02:45.409> to<00:02:45.500> be

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
but I I think dude mw3 is going to be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.649 
but I I think dude mw3 is going to be
unfortunately<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> step<00:02:46.790> back<00:02:47.000> for<00:02:47.239> some<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.510> us

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
unfortunately a step back for some of us

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.839 
unfortunately a step back for some of us
more<00:02:47.870> diehard<00:02:48.409> enthusiasts<00:02:49.099> yeah<00:02:49.400> we<00:02:49.700> might

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
more diehard enthusiasts yeah we might

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.940 
more diehard enthusiasts yeah we might
just<00:02:50.060> see<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.239> black<00:02:50.659> ops<00:02:50.900> kind<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.290> stay<00:02:51.889> in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
just see like black ops kind of stay in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.649 
just see like black ops kind of stay in
the<00:02:52.069> mainstream<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:52.909> competitive<00:02:53.510> game

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
the mainstream for a competitive game

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.660 
the mainstream for a competitive game
players<00:02:53.959> internal<00:02:54.470> toward<00:02:54.709> yeah<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> think<00:02:55.489> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
players internal toward yeah I think it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.339 
players internal toward yeah I think it
would<00:02:55.849> be<00:02:55.940> what<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.299> saw<00:02:56.510> with<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.780> call<00:02:57.139> duty

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
would be what we saw with a call duty

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.740 
would be what we saw with a call duty
foreign<00:02:58.010> world<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.310> war<00:02:58.489> where<00:02:58.599> all<00:02:59.599> do

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.339 
epic chat going right now yeah which is
not<00:04:07.669> really<00:04:07.699> about<00:04:08.150> pax<00:04:08.690> prime<00:04:08.959> even<00:04:09.260> though

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
not really about pax prime even though

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.319 
not really about pax prime even though
it's<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.709> titled<00:04:10.099> pax<00:04:10.340> prime<00:04:10.669> but<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.030> mean

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
it's like titled pax prime but I mean

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.939 
it's like titled pax prime but I mean
where<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.569> think<00:04:11.900> there's<00:04:12.049> at<00:04:12.169> least<00:04:12.199> 15<00:04:12.739> people

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
where I think there's at least 15 people

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.530 
where I think there's at least 15 people
in<00:04:13.159> there<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.790> think<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.060> list<00:04:14.269> will<00:04:14.419> keep

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
in there and I think the list will keep

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.330 
in there and I think the list will keep
growing<00:04:14.720> because<00:04:15.109> it<00:04:15.260> was<00:04:15.379> such<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> success<00:04:15.859> in

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
growing because it was such a success in
