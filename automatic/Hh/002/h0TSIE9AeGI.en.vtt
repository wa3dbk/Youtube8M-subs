00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.330
 How about friends of people from this Mexico 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.420
 today I want to show you the second part 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.420
 how to make them grow faster the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 offspring 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:22.150
 here I have approximately 100 120 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.109
 and they are about hmt k 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.680
 and you can have them in an aquarium of 40 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.509
 liters now require more space 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.260
 so they can be 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.409
 develop well and then there is not so much 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.190
 competition for space because although 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:46.579
 they are this small they already have something of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.900
 instinct then of territoriality and by 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.270
 we should give it a little more space 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.440
 first I'm going to put them on statins are 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.810
 of approximately 120 liters and add 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.990
 banana leaf right now I will go by 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.000
 some of guava and then I'm going to 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.580
 put an almond tree 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.790
 it is important to have oxygen to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.780
 maintain water quality and 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.710
 and the food that is not ingested 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.620
 then decompose quickly by the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.150
 oxygen support and although the betas already 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.470
 developed in the labyrinth in this 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.470
 stage of a month 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 we must replenish the oxygen for 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.509
 so they do not have so much 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.490
 requirement do not go out so much to take 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.440
 oxygen from the atmosphere 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.460
 so 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.260
 right now I just took them out of their 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.240
 aquarium already placed a heater for 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.490
 to balance the temperature we must 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.840
 to put them at the same temperature and 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.590
 what 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.210
 if we do not, the fry can 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.090
 pups can die from thermal shock 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.200
 if this water is hot and this is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.470
 cold that decompensates the temperature 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 Body of pepsi and can reach 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.450
 kill them 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.450
 so then 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.300
 I've done more carefully it was not 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.300
 none 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.099
 and now they are in a place 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.890
 the rest 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.250
 with more space and this is going to achieve that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.989
 develop a little faster 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.200
 food is important as they 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.090
 I comment a food with lots of 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.310
 protein goes 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.900
 cause beneficial effects in the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.829
 developing 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.030
 since at this stage it is when 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.209
 protein requirements need 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.939
 for your growth as they go 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.410
 growing is no longer necessary so much 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:20.330
 protein goes down the requirement 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.330
 but then there are the babies 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.730
 and well I tell you after a month and 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.849
 who have developed the labyrinth is 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.870
 necessary to place them somewhere else 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.200
 great for 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.629
 so that they grow faster already after 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.180
 that I have them here that already grow and 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.190
 already have the most defined colors 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.910
 I'm going to move to the system that I just 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.860
 make the recirculation system 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.380
 so that now they are in a space 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.900
 wider 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.400
 good greetings friends and I hope you 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.400
 like the video greetings
