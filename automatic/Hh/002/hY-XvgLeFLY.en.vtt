some<00:00:20.160> storage<00:00:25.310> another<00:00:26.310> storage<00:00:26.880> bag<00:00:27.210> here

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:01:11.149 

the<00:00:32.669> dog<00:01:08.119> sings<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.360> mean<00:01:09.570> I've<00:01:10.079> been<00:01:10.290> I've

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the dog sings pretty mean I've been I've

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.130 
the dog sings pretty mean I've been I've
got<00:01:11.340> about<00:01:11.430> 300<00:01:12.240> miles<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:15.140> it's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
got about 300 miles on it now and it's

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.539 
got about 300 miles on it now and it's
still<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> engine<00:01:16.770> braking<00:01:16.979> period<00:01:17.430> which

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
still in the engine braking period which

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.780 
still in the engine braking period which
means<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> computer<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> chip

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
means that the computer in the chip

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
means that the computer in the chip
force<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.270> slower<00:01:22.070> that's<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> simply

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
force it to go slower that's I simply

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
force it to go slower that's I simply
slower<00:01:23.760> then<00:01:24.000> limit<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> RPMs<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
slower then limit the RPMs that the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.070 
slower then limit the RPMs that the
engine<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.380> spin<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> can't<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:27.990> as

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
engine can spin at so I can't get it as

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.930 
engine can spin at so I can't get it as
fast<00:01:28.260> as<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.620> go<00:01:30.260> but<00:01:31.260> just<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.580> same<00:01:32.610> I've

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
fast as it can go but just the same I've

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.870 
fast as it can go but just the same I've
been<00:01:33.060> able<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.300> get<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.810> over<00:01:33.930> 110<00:01:34.880> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
been able to get at just over 110 and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
been able to get at just over 110 and
that's<00:01:36.330> had<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:37.140> five<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.100> six<00:01:38.310> hundred<00:01:38.370> rpm

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that's had about five or six hundred rpm

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.899 
that's had about five or six hundred rpm
less<00:01:39.210> than<00:01:40.170> its<00:01:40.350> maximum<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.610> peak

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
less than its maximum so and then peak

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
less than its maximum so and then peak
rpm<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> Earth<00:01:42.630> peak<00:01:42.870> horsepower<00:01:43.229> output<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
rpm and Earth peak horsepower output is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149 
rpm and Earth peak horsepower output is
just<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.120> 8200<00:01:45.720> RPM<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.710> getting<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
just at 8200 RPM and I'm only getting to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.789 
just at 8200 RPM and I'm only getting to
about<00:01:48.619> 76<00:01:49.619> 77<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.430> hundred<00:01:50.880> rpm<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
about 76 77 or hundred rpm so I'm pretty

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.080 
about 76 77 or hundred rpm so I'm pretty
sure<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.010> can<00:01:53.100> probably<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:53.729> damn<00:01:53.880> close

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sure I can probably a pretty damn close

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.039 
sure I can probably a pretty damn close
to<00:01:54.150> 120<00:01:55.040> once<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.479> maxed<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:59.869> we've<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to 120 once it's maxed out we've got a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.500 
to 120 once it's maxed out we've got a
lot<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> horsepower<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:02.119> can<00:02:03.320> sit<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.470> and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
lot of horsepower I can sit on it and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.969 
lot of horsepower I can sit on it and
fight<00:02:06.510> hit<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.229> phone<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.590> hard<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.920> can

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
fight hit that phone as hard as I can

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.410 
fight hit that phone as hard as I can
from<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.909> standstill

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
from a standstill

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
from a standstill
it<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.349> lift<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> front<00:02:10.830> end<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it will lift the front end up and do a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.420 
it will lift the front end up and do a
wheelie<00:02:11.549> on<00:02:11.849> good<00:02:12.750> snow<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:14.310> without

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
wheelie on good snow and that's without

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.600 
wheelie on good snow and that's without
studs<00:02:14.939> so<00:02:15.739> we've<00:02:16.739> got<00:02:16.860> plenty<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.189> pick<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
studs so we've got plenty of pick up and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.750 
studs so we've got plenty of pick up and
move<00:02:18.680> longer<00:02:19.680> tracked<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> other<00:02:20.430> ones<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
move longer tracked and the other ones I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.720 
move longer tracked and the other ones I
have<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> far<00:02:22.920> I'm<00:02:22.980> very<00:02:23.040> happy<00:02:23.549> with<00:02:23.640> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
have so far I'm very happy with this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.600 
have so far I'm very happy with this
machine

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
machine

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180 
machine
these<00:02:26.610> renegades<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.270> will<00:02:27.420> never<00:02:27.569> go<00:02:27.810> back<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
these renegades I will never go back to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.210 
these renegades I will never go back to
a<00:02:29.220> short<00:02:29.490> track<00:02:29.790> again<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.560> right<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.040> much

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
a short track again the right is so much

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.020 
a short track again the right is so much
smoother<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:34.709> unbelievable<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> here<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.800> go

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
smoother it's unbelievable so here we go

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.480 
smoother it's unbelievable so here we go
buy<00:02:39.030> this
