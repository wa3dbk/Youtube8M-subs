00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.759
 plastic naturally all creak 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.560
 squeaky such a well, of course 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:26.049
 low quality means that means we 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 car passed 124,000 means we have 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.609
 heater block 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 temperature adjustment is made in 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:38.319
 in this way it means nuance right here at 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.530
 we have an air supply adjustment 1 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.310

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.710
 it means we are coming if it ends 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.950
 the fluid in the washer reservoir then lights up 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.049
 light bulb if not lit 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.649
 stop light whether something else lights up it 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.819
 the watches here were quartz watches 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.959
 I had to replace them as they came out 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.540
 failing that means gearbox 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.420
 5-speed 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 zaniya stuck means so here on the floor 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.019
 and forward well as it is like 1 only 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.730
 need to stick and give them to the floor 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:38.390
 automatic windows he 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 it means completely all the workers that means 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.870
 headlight adjustment well hydrocorrector 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.150
 broke down physically that is immediately like 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.489
 only the car came out of the cabin that is 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.410
 the open button has stopped working 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.410
 trunk means and open the hood 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.570
 mean immediately on the engine 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.850
 hinges as I said 16 liters 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.500
 16-valve means that produced by 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.720
 work was replaced by gasket 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.790
 engine it cost about sixty 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 dollars well, of course not on 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.690
 official car service candles 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.570
 changed repeatedly and the oil is the same 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.190
 sore point this pump pump stands in 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.610
 about 50 dollars that is 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.070
 maybe less can more that is too 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.580
 after all, find here by candle 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.220
 candles, too, is worth it dollars 10 and a liter 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.209
 oil 10 you 40 for this machine is 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:48.080
 because it's about let's say so 2 3 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:50.670
 dollars it will be a liter of oil that means 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.770
 proceed to the inspection of the trunk 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 so we have a back here 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.940
 decorative cover such as 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.010
 reflector is a disease given 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.510
 cars it cracks and breaks that is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 usual in the same condition leave it 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.150
 there is no one changes because it makes sense 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.550
 this is not opened the trunk means 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.209
 look at the trunk so it means here we have 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.580
 top or such as a regiment is moving 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.640
 the trunk is quite roomy that is 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.240
 He has absolutely all the seats 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.520
 add up means again too 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.520
 the seat is jammed slightly 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.030
 and problematically fall for that is 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.169
 then again, there are nuances here comes from 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.169
 us full reserve 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:48.570
 so here it all goes along with 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.570
 car means 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.620
 we go black threshold of it all 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.350
 models 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.660
 what are they not painted and black 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:08.550
 mirrors that is, but it is normal with us 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:12.010
 that means we go 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.620
 backseat behind her and the back row here 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.720
 it means well a bit cramped of course but in 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.680
 principle two adults will intervene 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.680
 very simple 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.550
 it means well, in principle, whatever car I am 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.550
 would like that is then reno duster in 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.800
 principle to change this car will not give you 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.740
 absolutely no trouble here 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.710
 principle on the car so much all by 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.820
 I want to say the expense that is hitting 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.970
 somewhere 8 liters per hundred here in the city 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.710
 6 liters in the country can be even 5 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.620
 meet that is a pretty machine 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:59.350
 economically well, so basically it seems like 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.730
 all here 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:07.950
 all base attention that looked 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.950
 this video is all good bye
