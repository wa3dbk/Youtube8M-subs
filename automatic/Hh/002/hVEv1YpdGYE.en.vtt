00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.710
 in 1950 there was no playstation xbox 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 computers or televisions 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.929
 the children did not have those devices 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.680
 they had fun but with something different with 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.920
 a park like an amusement park 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.490
 the children after school went to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.810
 park where they could have fun have 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.980
 his friends his fights his hobbies 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.170
 all 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.140
 They had slides seesaws swings 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.670
 there was something that was the most striking 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.600
 loved by your children 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.640
 a little train 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 a train with a clown face 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.740
 the kids were fighting over that train was 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.400
 the most exciting and fun to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.550
 them the worst you could do in that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 park in a scratch or occasionally 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.510
 a bruise 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.440
 the train was not very fast or technological 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.990
 It was very old also the smoke that came out 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.659
 of him was toxic 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.390
 although nobody could get intoxicated since 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.110
 they were outdoors although the children 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.980
 after going every day 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.060
 and did them some damage 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.060
 but nothing serious 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 on the train ride there was like 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.890
 a long cave which was the part most 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.290
 exciting of the whole journey 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.080
 one day the little train stopped 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.810
 and by bad luck of fate he did 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.140
 inside the cave 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.890
 the children laughed shouting was something 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 exciting for them 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.430
 like when there was a blackout eye you get 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.750
 I got off the train you were the most 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.060
 Ladybug of all 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.580
 about two hours later a mother arrived 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
 running not because I had to come to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.380
 look for your son or daughter but because 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.750
 children ladybugs that came out of the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.920
 cave were crying the first adult 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.040
 who saw 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.190
 the woman came in with an internal and back 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.660
 from her the other parents went 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 adults started coughing 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.530
 and the worst happened when they got more 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.890
 in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 the children had died from the gas 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 toxic train 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.480

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.939

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:10.920
 the slides all including the train 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.110
 the adults after so much beer 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.210
 They decided to take a ride on that train 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.270
 to start the tour with laughter and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.960
 party everything turned to crying and 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:27.460
 discord when they entered the tunnel and 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:30.319
 they began to hear laughter a laugh 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.990
 very particular 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.770
