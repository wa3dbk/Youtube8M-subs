00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
at first I kind of thought he might be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
at first I kind of thought he might be
but<00:00:26.369> now<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.789> they've<00:00:26.970> spoiled<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
but now that they've spoiled it and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.240 
but now that they've spoiled it and
announced<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.170> he's<00:00:28.320> returning<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.980> smack

down<00:00:29.550> before<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> world<00:00:30.720> level<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.500> kind<00:00:31.740> of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
down before the world level I'm kind of

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
down before the world level I'm kind of
thinking<00:00:32.009> maybe<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.910> maybe<00:00:33.120> him<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.420> waiver

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
thinking maybe not maybe him and waiver

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
thinking maybe not maybe him and waiver
will<00:00:34.079> continue<00:00:34.469> their<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:34.920> rivalry<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

you all the way to resume now the other
option<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
option I think for a lot of people is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
option I think for a lot of people is
Chris<00:00:39.930> Jericho<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.649> lot<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> people

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
Chris Jericho a lot of people

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
Chris Jericho a lot of people
speculating<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.850> Jericho<00:00:42.510> winning<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
speculating on Jericho winning the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
speculating on Jericho winning the
rumble<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.739> way<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.070> leaning<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
rumble which way are you leaning in the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.950 
rumble which way are you leaning in the
rumble<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> think

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
rumble you know what the more I think

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600

about<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.829> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> makes<00:00:47.399> sense

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
about it the more it kind of makes sense

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
about it the more it kind of makes sense
for<00:00:47.879> Jericho<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> win<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> rumble<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.350> know

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
for Jericho to win the rumble you know

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
for Jericho to win the rumble you know
i'd<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.129> someone<00:00:50.399> up-and-coming

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
i'd like to see someone up-and-coming

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.900 
i'd like to see someone up-and-coming
media<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.410> Dolph<00:00:53.100> Ziggler's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
media what Dolph Ziggler's not really

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
media what Dolph Ziggler's not really
up-and-coming<00:00:54.149> he's<00:00:54.600> pretty<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.110> reach

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
up-and-coming he's pretty much reach

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
up-and-coming he's pretty much reach
that<00:00:56.250> level<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:57.930> needs

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that level but I don't think he needs

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
that level but I don't think he needs
that<00:00:58.350> lumber<00:00:58.680> win<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.430> maybe<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that lumber win right now maybe a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
that lumber win right now maybe a
Sheamus<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.079> Jericho<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> that's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Sheamus but Jericho and and that's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
Sheamus but Jericho and and that's
something<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.589> rumble<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
something the rumble really could do for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
something the rumble really could do for
somebody<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> win<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> kind

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
somebody to win like I think that kind

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
somebody to win like I think that kind
of<00:01:08.250> established<00:01:09.210> Del<00:01:09.390> Rio<00:01:09.630> last<00:01:09.960> year<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of established Del Rio last year as a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.990 
of established Del Rio last year as a

main eventer that you should be taking

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
main eventer that you should be taking
seriously<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> things<00:01:13.380> i<00:01:13.619> also

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
seriously and one of the things i also

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
seriously and one of the things i also
love<00:01:14.070> about<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> rumble<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.000> usually

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
love about the rumble is they usually

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
love about the rumble is they usually
put<00:01:15.600> someone<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> mid<00:01:17.040> car

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
put someone that that's in the mid car

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
put someone that that's in the mid car
that's<00:01:17.460> doing<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.210> put<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that's doing well and they put them in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
that's doing well and they put them in
there<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> significant<00:01:19.680> period<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.070> time

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
there for a significant period of time

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
there for a significant period of time
and<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.610> hoping<00:01:20.909> someone<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> Cody

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and I'm hoping someone like a Cody

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.230 
and I'm hoping someone like a Cody
Rhodes<00:01:22.229> maybe<00:01:22.619> gets<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> spot<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:24.030> win

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Rhodes maybe gets that spot to not win

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
Rhodes maybe gets that spot to not win
