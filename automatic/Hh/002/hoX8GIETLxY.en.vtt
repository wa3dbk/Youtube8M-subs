00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
woods 10 it was let's say really easy

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.990 
woods 10 it was let's say really easy
and<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:13.150> game<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:15.430> an

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
and to go to this game it's an

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.020 
and to go to this game it's an
incredible<00:02:16.810> overhaul<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.680> how<00:02:17.709> hard<00:02:18.400> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
incredible overhaul of how hard this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.640 
incredible overhaul of how hard this
game<00:02:19.299> is<00:02:19.510> compared<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.049> tiger<00:02:20.290> woods<00:02:20.319> game

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
game is compared to the tiger woods game

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.339 
game is compared to the tiger woods game
in<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.430> tiger<00:02:21.730> woods<00:02:21.940> game<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.690> not<00:02:23.019> that

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
in the tiger woods game it's not that

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.410 
in the tiger woods game it's not that
responsive<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.120> very

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
responsive and in this it's very

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.559 
responsive and in this it's very
responsive<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.489> throw<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
responsive so if you throw it and you

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.880 
responsive so if you throw it and you
think<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.840> can<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.079> throw<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.380> wherever<00:02:29.560> and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
think you can just throw it wherever and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.360 
think you can just throw it wherever and
it'll<00:02:30.010> go<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.769> vicinity<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
it'll go like in the vicinity of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
it'll go like in the vicinity of
straight<00:02:34.000> you're<00:02:34.420> totally<00:02:34.780> wrong<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.769> need

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
straight you're totally wrong you need

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.580 
straight you're totally wrong you need
to<00:02:36.040> be<00:02:36.190> very<00:02:36.459> careful<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.480> throw<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
to be very careful with it and throw it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 
to be very careful with it and throw it
exactly<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.730> would<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> frisbee<00:02:40.209> that's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
exactly like you would a frisbee that's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.030 
exactly like you would a frisbee that's
why<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.019> kind<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.350> like<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.650> game<00:02:41.829> more<00:02:41.980> than

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
why I kind of like this game more than

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.059 
why I kind of like this game more than
Tiger<00:02:42.370> Woods<00:02:43.079> not<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.230> whole<00:02:44.380> game<00:02:44.680> but<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
Tiger Woods not the whole game but the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.210 
Tiger Woods not the whole game but the
frisbee<00:02:45.400> golf<00:02:45.639> aspect<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.799> lot

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
frisbee golf aspect because it's a lot

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.440 
frisbee golf aspect because it's a lot
more<00:02:48.250> responsive<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.180> lot<00:02:49.420> harder<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
more responsive and a lot harder the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.000 
more responsive and a lot harder the
only<00:02:52.690> difference<00:02:52.870> between<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.319> two<00:02:53.470> games<00:02:53.709> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
only difference between the two games is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.569 
only difference between the two games is
that<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:55.510> Tiger<00:02:56.319> Woods<00:02:56.500> there's<00:02:56.799> an<00:02:57.069> actual

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
that in Tiger Woods there's an actual

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.199 
that in Tiger Woods there's an actual
frisbee<00:02:58.480> golf<00:02:58.989> hole<00:02:59.950> kind<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.880> thing<00:03:01.060> where

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
frisbee golf hole kind of thing where
