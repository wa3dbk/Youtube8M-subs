you how I shape fingerboard trucks this
is<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> hanger<00:00:07.770> from<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> technic<00:00:09.269> longboard

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110

comparison<00:00:23.960> okay<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:26.060> all<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.290> did<00:00:28.290> this<00:00:28.410> very

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
comparison okay so all I did this very

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.270 
comparison okay so all I did this very
simply<00:00:29.010> um<00:00:29.370> I<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.610> sleep<00:00:32.850> truck<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
simply um I have to sleep truck and a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.630 
simply um I have to sleep truck and a
rotary<00:00:35.280> tool<00:00:35.400> or<00:00:35.880> journal<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.420> use<00:00:36.960> blue<00:00:37.140> clock

there's<00:00:38.640> plenty<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.970> brilliance<00:00:39.300> though<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
there's plenty of brilliance though and

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.990 
there's plenty of brilliance though and
I<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.170> tip<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.650> I'm<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.820> sure

I use this tip here I'm not really sure
what<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.210> called<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.350> um<00:00:43.580> it's<00:00:44.580> like<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what it's called but um it's like a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.640 
what it's called but um it's like a
gritty<00:00:45.180> material<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.080> as<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
gritty material and as you can see you

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.729 
gritty material and as you can see you
have<00:00:46.680> shaped<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.420> still<00:00:48.629> works<00:00:48.840> um

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
have shaped a lot but it still works um

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.890 
have shaped a lot but it still works um
you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.220> use<00:00:50.340> whatever<00:00:50.879> bit<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> find<00:00:51.690> works

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
you can use whatever bit you find works

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.640 
you can use whatever bit you find works
best<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
best for you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I just use this one so there's a truck

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:08.270 
I just use this one so there's a truck
and<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:56.970> get<00:00:57.120> started<00:01:05.479> as<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.690> can<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.320> one

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and let's get started as you can see one

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.570 
and let's get started as you can see one
side<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.550> coming<00:01:08.970> along<00:01:09.229> um<00:01:10.280> I'm<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.399> gonna

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
side is coming along um I'm just gonna

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.749 
side is coming along um I'm just gonna
quickly<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.060> through<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.350> exactly<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.220> am

quickly go through you what exactly I am
doing<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.600> case<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> kind<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:17.250> difficult<00:01:17.670> for

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
doing in case it's kind of difficult for

you<00:01:17.850> guys<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.030> tell<00:01:18.360> um<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.680> take<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> rotary

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you guys to tell um you take the rotary

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359 
you guys to tell um you take the rotary
tool<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.660> to<00:01:22.009> work<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.250> in

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
tool and you just want to work it in

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.389 
tool and you just want to work it in
here<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.300> know<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> side

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
here you know kind of going side to side

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.890 
here you know kind of going side to side
whatever<00:01:27.150> shape<00:01:27.510> you<00:01:27.540> want<00:01:29.299> what<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.330> typically

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
whatever shape you want what I typically

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.520 
whatever shape you want what I typically
do<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:32.450> see<00:01:33.450> where<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.720> eaten<00:01:34.140> down<00:01:34.260> right

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
do is see where it's eaten down right

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.940 
do is see where it's eaten down right
there

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
there
compared<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.380> that's<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> do

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
compared to right there that's what I do

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
compared to right there that's what I do
I<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.890> try<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> round<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.760> because

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I just try to round it out because

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
I just try to round it out because
that's<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> shape<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that's the shape I like and then see the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.510 
that's the shape I like and then see the
sides<00:01:41.580> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> square<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.290> around<00:01:43.560> my

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
sides kind of square I like to around my

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.260 
sides kind of square I like to around my
edges<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.350> know<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
edges here I just you know kind of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.039 
edges here I just you know kind of
rounding<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:51.049> that's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
rounding going down this way so that's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:07.810 
rounding going down this way so that's
all<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:54.290> let's

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.870 

so<00:02:08.820> here's<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.649> shaped<00:02:10.649> truck<00:02:11.039> after<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
so here's the shaped truck after all of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.710 
so here's the shaped truck after all of
that<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.340> keep<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.910> doing<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.270> until<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that you just keep on doing it until you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200 
that you just keep on doing it until you
get<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> desired<00:02:16.020> shape<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.210> and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
get the desired shape that you want and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.110 
get the desired shape that you want and
this<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.420> pretty<00:02:19.130> close<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.430> set<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
this is pretty close to the set that I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.920 
this is pretty close to the set that I
have<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:26.600> pretty<00:02:27.600> close<00:02:29.330> um<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.630> might<00:02:30.750> be

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
have now see pretty close um it might be

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.740 
have now see pretty close um it might be
a<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.170> skinnier<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> can

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
a little skinnier here but so you can

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.120 
a little skinnier here but so you can
keep<00:02:33.900> working<00:02:33.959> at<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> shape<00:02:35.100> that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
keep working at it to get the shape that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.050 
keep working at it to get the shape that
you<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.390> um<00:02:37.040> after<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:38.400> done<00:02:38.550> shaping

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
you want so um after I'm done shaping

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.810 
you want so um after I'm done shaping
here<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.320> shape<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.220> shape<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.550> part

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
here like a shape and I shape this part

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.479 
here like a shape and I shape this part
I<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.120> go<00:02:42.270> over<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.810> entire<00:02:42.930> truck<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
I just go over the entire truck just to
