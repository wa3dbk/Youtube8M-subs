00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:15.350
 I have often I see quite a do it yourself videos watch videos on tablet 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 Or to study the movement of Ajikin it will Uwamawaro the last time 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 I'm there is also a video production thunder from overseas to the fact that the video streaming on youtube 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.650
 At that time, the bottleneck is the communication speed and the 7 giga limit 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 If it is difficult to receive measured data or use a lot, it will exceed the data volume limit 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.290
 I was in trouble because there was a month when I ended up 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.730
 During this time I got the latest wimax 2+ router this time this excellent thing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.730
 I would like to introduce 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.590
 This wimax 2+ wx 0 is used but the speed I was surprised at first 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.340
 What 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.829
 I did not have the impression I mean become so much faster I mobile wi-fi router 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.350
 But if there is no such a thing at all 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.350
 It is crisp and comfortable even if you look at the video 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:39.570
 Since it goes well with moss I'm troubled when the Internet is not available and with Sophie 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 There is also a need to check the video from overseas people during shooting, so the area is wide and fast 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.560
 I'm in trouble with the tone 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.950
 That point wimax is very fun from now on that this spring longfoot area is expanded nationwide 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.950
 is 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.740
 It says that you can use the Internet at the same speed at home or outside 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 Moreover, it is very nice to not feel that person 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.620
 I'm a prince 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.950
 This is the last reason I can use it soon 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.420
 As there is no match, the radio control is not caught either 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:31.940
 When I would think while Wyvern are other things you will not be able to use 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.870
 Cyber purse of going out mobile and wimax 2 + without permission 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.870
 2 items 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.830
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.830
 tee 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.460
 Ah ah ah ah
