00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.169
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.199
 and today we have an amazing fight 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.710
 on such a tank to a ninth fr shki 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.640
 level this su-122 54 which I opened for 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.350
 freedom I will not say that I am really happy but 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.340
 interesting fights on her still happen 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.070
 and this example we have on robin 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.249
 I have installed some mods I did not have time 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.039
 progruzutsya straight for the start of the battle and that 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.260
 most importantly me and as it should not 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.839
 stayed at base first 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.659
 just fight to shoot at first 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.600
 I'll light up right off the spot and 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.839
 flew to have time to drive like this 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.140
 here on the water and squeeze the enemy 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.440
 because every second counts here 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.110
 patency by the way the su-122 54 somehow 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.970
 little water naedet feeble 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.500
 how can we say the same type as all 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450
 principle Soviet haircuts let's say on 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.680
 the same british fevashki doctor 40 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.480
 total top speed 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.230
 but with all this water 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.960
 rides much faster but never mind i 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.750
 I have no time to spot me right away 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.540
 I will say that I have here 5 first crew 2 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.090
 68 objects I transplanted that is 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.700
 masking frat valve worth optics 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.250
 no, with all 390 meters of view 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.460
 without optics and I immediately drop into this 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.400
 a bush put out my nose a little bit 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.730
 and immediately see that I start to shine 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.940
 enemies here let's say 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.930
 t57 heavy friends on there 100 meters them this 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.250
 Havik 103 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.170
 shovel at 420 review well, of course there 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.900
 let's say 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.270
 fart and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.450
 a hundred meters friends he me just not 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.090
 sees even let's say on object 268 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.510
 which is there super inconspicuous I would it 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.530
 probably lit, well, the thing is that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.140
 su-122 54 it is compact enough that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.240
 he even watched you from the mountain from others 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.240
 positions you just do not shine through 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.580
 because you are exactly your low and 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.890
 short silhouette you can hide well for 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.470
 any bushes and here's a physicist friends 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.680
 already driving up to 89 meters 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.470
 I aim at the enemies to the range finder 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.450
 I switched on and I saw the distance 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.940
 to know when about me already 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.550
 exactly lit up and we know in game 50 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.760
 meters and you shine a hundred percent then 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.050
 there is 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.880
 triggered the so-called x-ray and I 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.720
 I continue to stand on my light bulb 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.340
 naturally pumped it did not glow 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.180
 precisely because I have no one 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.459
 luminaries 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.850
 until the damage somehow in such a position 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.620
 strike us for victory i do all that 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.030
 can 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.430
 illuminate the enemies are traveling they just don't 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.769
 understand and see they really 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.700
 in 100 even less meters it passes 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.590
 even art glows 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.260
 then most likely I'm not the candle yes she 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.470
 there for 500 meters but all these 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.750
 tanks shine through it I am here I am already 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.880
 would not be lit 2 68 if not 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 stirred but I thought he would drive up and 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.810
 let me shoot x-rays to shoot 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.660
 already somehow wanted here I am going to and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.730
 100 with a turn by the way about the gun here I 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.280
 I do not know a separate video probably 150 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.470
 su-122 54 take off because the gun is here 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.610
 separate conversation and their something good 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.830
 I can hardly tell you about it because alpha 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.130
 here sad break through sad as 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.900
 for pt 9 level and mixing accuracy 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.250
 considering that we do not have a tower constantly 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.739
 have to turn around too 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.110
 I was saddened and therefore I did not want 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.150
 earlier in this at 704 to where there is 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.950
 position in the bushes and adjust it was but 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.319
 I'm already trying to work as a firefighter 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.849
 and here's the most interesting friends I'm even on 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:13.260
 pause pause 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:17.350
 55 meters fifty five meters worth 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.250
 268 x-ray object triggered up to 50 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.810
 dublin he has a review of 400 meters 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.479
 statistics he has 57 percent here 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.820
 love him there a bunch of perks can even 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.400
 Optics stands at 57 percent of that is, 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.380
 spruce enough player well how do we derive 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.710
 to green everything is as it should be from 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.360
 top clan I continued to stand and 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.940
 shine it's spinning in my light bulb not 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.770
 it works and he in the midst is already here 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.889
 drives only 50 meters and only 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.830
 then x-ray see me yes yes 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.240
 this 51 even meter he does not shine me 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.729
 friends do you imagine how much 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.160
 unnoticed this pillow with her everything in it 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.860
 so small here he disappears again and 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.080
 i'm just standing here really like 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.479
 invisible enemies just go crazy 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.160
 because I highlight them at first 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.860
 well here i'm too easy to stick out 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.410
 Insolent nose so well if they are in these 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.410
 bushes and not too impudent these especially 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.240
 t57 heavy then the third which 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.250
 really more than 400 meters of view 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.800
 they just do not see me at a distance 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.050
 less than 100 meters here such miracles sometimes 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.650
 going on in this game but this gun 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.990
 just some from 206 too from 8 well you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.960
 on it don't do these because u 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.950
 but he has more, or why 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.860
 Well, of course this point was driving there 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.710
 it turns out but considering there are no friends 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.510
 No, in the first place, not optics, not a network 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.600
 there are horns and a grid 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.349
 put and I would become in these bushes to 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.270
 it was then I would think from now just 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.450
 let's admire the results from me 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.720
 only 780 damage per fight well while 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.690
 I gave the first degree and attention friends 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.510
 Lit on ptshke on ptshshke wear without 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.419
 optics even i have no optics anything 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.460
 I have written on it for review 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.649
 Well, 9 and a half thousand in a frenzy here 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.229
 almost 10 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:13.479
 intelligence damage on pc without optics 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.659
 damn will i just nobody 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.249
 sat and cool straight honestly misunderstandings 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.169
 I hope you like friends this fight 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:21.819
 also like me he is certainly not dynamic 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.669
 the creature will make it stand in these 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.129
 bushes in for that how everything is cool and 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.929
 fascinating happened thanks that 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.999
