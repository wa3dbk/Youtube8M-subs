00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740 
on the stereo jack now it's time to
finish<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> mics<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.909> we'll<00:02:06.299> take<00:02:06.540> our

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
finish up the mics and we'll take our

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020 
finish up the mics and we'll take our
earbud<00:02:07.170> replacement<00:02:07.799> cushions<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> put

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
earbud replacement cushions and put

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.300 
earbud replacement cushions and put
those<00:02:09.179> over<00:02:09.509> each<00:02:09.690> microphone<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> also<00:02:10.890> used<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
those over each microphone I also used a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
those over each microphone I also used a
piece<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.670> magnet<00:02:12.120> wire<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.629> wrapped<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
piece of magnet wire and wrapped it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620 
piece of magnet wire and wrapped it
tightly<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.890> hold<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> foam<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.580> place<00:02:14.820> so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
tightly to hold the foam in place so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480 
tightly to hold the foam in place so
what<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.960> binaural<00:02:16.410> recording<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.220> how<00:02:17.340> does

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
what is binaural recording and how does

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.220 
what is binaural recording and how does
it<00:02:17.610> work<00:02:17.820> well<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.630> idea<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.990> binaural

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it work well the idea of binaural

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.440 
it work well the idea of binaural
recording<00:02:19.500> goes<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> late<00:02:20.520> 1800s

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
recording goes back to the late 1800s

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.300 
recording goes back to the late 1800s
when<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.750> was<00:02:21.870> first<00:02:22.020> played<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.130> kind

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
when it was first played with and kind

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.400 
when it was first played with and kind
of<00:02:23.400> developed<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.480> idea<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.050> place

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
of developed and the idea is to place

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.280 
of developed and the idea is to place
two<00:02:25.680> microphones<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:27.000> seven<00:02:27.510> inches<00:02:27.870> apart

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
two microphones about seven inches apart

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.990 
two microphones about seven inches apart
from<00:02:28.410> each<00:02:28.680> other<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.190> that's<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.790> same

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
from each other and that's the same

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.690 
from each other and that's the same
distance<00:02:30.450> between<00:02:30.780> most<00:02:31.590> people's<00:02:31.950> ears<00:02:32.460> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
distance between most people's ears and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.510 
distance between most people's ears and
what<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> pretty<00:02:34.500> cool<00:02:34.860> recording

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
what you get is a pretty cool recording

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.860 
what you get is a pretty cool recording
effect<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> could<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.630> only

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
effect that you could really only

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.670 
effect that you could really only
realize<00:02:37.710> by<00:02:38.160> using<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.730> set<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.030> headphones<00:02:39.690> now

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
