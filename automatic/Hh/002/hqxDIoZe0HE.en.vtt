00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.330 
one of them happens to become a rare not
only<00:03:05.720> do<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.110> value<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.070> ounce

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
only do you have the value of the ounce

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.730 
only do you have the value of the ounce
of<00:03:07.580> silver<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.270> just<00:03:08.510> bought<00:03:08.750> but<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.560> also

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
of silver you just bought but you also

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.740 
of silver you just bought but you also
have<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:11.290> value<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:16.040> coin<00:03:16.400> itself<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
have the value of the coin itself and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.180 
have the value of the coin itself and
that's<00:03:18.020> why<00:03:18.520> personally<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.550> would<00:03:19.850> recommend

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
that's why personally I would recommend

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.680 
that's why personally I would recommend
rather<00:03:22.190> than<00:03:22.459> spending<00:03:22.880> all<00:03:23.060> your<00:03:23.239> mining

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
rather than spending all your mining

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.600 
rather than spending all your mining
bars<00:03:23.900> are<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> good<00:03:24.380> idea<00:03:24.680> rather<00:03:25.459> than

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
bars are a good idea rather than

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.810 
bars are a good idea rather than
spending<00:03:26.000> all<00:03:26.239> your<00:03:26.600> money<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:27.940> silver<00:03:28.940> in

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
spending all your money on silver in

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.180 
spending all your money on silver in
silver<00:03:31.820> bars<00:03:33.130> purchase<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> few<00:03:34.580> coins<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.360> well

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
silver bars purchase a few coins as well

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.380 
silver bars purchase a few coins as well
the<00:03:37.190> cheapest<00:03:37.610> ones<00:03:37.820> you're<00:03:37.970> going<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.180> find

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
the cheapest ones you're going to find

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.130 
the cheapest ones you're going to find
are<00:03:39.140> going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.590> be<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.750> current<00:03:42.080> year

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
are going to be the current year

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.080 
are going to be the current year
probably<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:44.440> there'll<00:03:45.440> be<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.560> few<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.550> few

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
probably and there'll be a few a few

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.440 
probably and there'll be a few a few
dollars<00:03:47.300> over<00:03:47.950> over<00:03:49.090> current<00:03:50.090> price<00:03:50.270> of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
dollars over over current price of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.920 
dollars over over current price of
silver<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.020> bring<00:03:51.920> them<00:03:52.160> but<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.300> think

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
silver and bring them but there I think

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.410 
silver and bring them but there I think
they<00:03:54.050> really<00:03:54.320> add<00:03:54.500> up<00:03:54.530> over<00:03:55.010> time<00:03:55.340> being<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
they really add up over time being a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.570 
they really add up over time being a
coin<00:03:56.750> rather<00:03:57.080> than<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:58.300> bar<00:03:59.300> right<00:04:00.050> here<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
coin rather than a bar right here you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.900 
coin rather than a bar right here you
said<00:04:01.880> in<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.239> video<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:02.570> weren't<00:04:02.959> going<00:04:03.080> to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
said in the video you weren't going to

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.820 
said in the video you weren't going to
worry<00:04:04.910> too<00:04:05.000> much<00:04:05.180> about<00:04:05.390> gold<00:04:05.989> because<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.770> the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
worry too much about gold because of the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.070 
worry too much about gold because of the
price<00:04:07.810> but

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
price but

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.260 
price but
as<00:04:10.620> long<00:04:10.980> as<00:04:11.010> you're<00:04:11.280> not<00:04:11.340> ordering<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:12.000> large

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
as long as you're not ordering in large

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.630 
as long as you're not ordering in large
quantities<00:04:12.900> it's<00:04:13.290> really<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.890> too<00:04:14.130> bad<00:04:14.340> right

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
quantities it's really not too bad right

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.530 
quantities it's really not too bad right
here<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.580> compared<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.180> back<00:04:18.420> up

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
here if you can see compared to back up

big<00:04:18.720> hands<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.350> here<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.340> size<00:04:20.580> of<00:04:20.670> my

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
big hands but here to the size of my

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.240 
big hands but here to the size of my
hand<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:23.400> bars<00:04:23.880> rather<00:04:24.210> small<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.100> is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
hand the bars rather small but this is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.090 
hand the bars rather small but this is
one<00:04:26.490> gram<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.820> gold<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:28.620> then<00:04:28.740> we<00:04:28.860> tossed

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
one gram of gold and then we tossed

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.540 
one gram of gold and then we tossed
about<00:04:29.280> 50<00:04:29.760> bucks<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:34.440> that's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.920> that's<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.340> more

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550

you're going to be buying in smaller

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.580 
you're going to be buying in smaller
quantities<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:58.110> if<00:04:58.230> you<00:04:58.320> really<00:04:58.500> are

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
quantities but if you really are

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
quantities but if you really are

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
interested in gold and of course gold

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.750 
interested in gold and of course gold
actually<00:05:01.470> is<00:05:01.590> going<00:05:01.860> up<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.070> price<00:05:02.130> faster

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
actually is going up in price faster

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.880 
actually is going up in price faster
than<00:05:02.970> silver<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.480> I<00:05:04.140> would<00:05:04.260> recommend<00:05:04.560> just

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
than silver and I would recommend just

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.160 
than silver and I would recommend just
getting<00:05:05.130> these<00:05:06.020> one<00:05:07.020> gram<00:05:07.730> credit<00:05:08.730> suisse

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
getting these one gram credit suisse

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.460 
getting these one gram credit suisse
backed<00:05:10.170> by<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.530> Swiss<00:05:11.100> government<00:05:12.200> gold<00:05:13.200> bars

backed by the Swiss government gold bars
there's<00:05:14.190> just<00:05:14.310> one<00:05:14.430> gram<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:19.320> that's<00:05:19.620> what<00:05:19.830> I

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
there's just one gram and that's what I

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.440 
there's just one gram and that's what I
recommend<00:05:20.250> doing<00:05:20.520> if<00:05:20.730> you're<00:05:20.880> interested<00:05:21.419> in

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
recommend doing if you're interested in

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.140 
recommend doing if you're interested in
gold<00:05:21.720> because<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.860> realized<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:24.000> is

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
gold because I realized that that is

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.090 
gold because I realized that that is
more<00:05:24.300> expensive<00:05:24.510> as<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.410> can<00:05:25.530> see<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.950> my

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
more expensive as you can see that my

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.330 
more expensive as you can see that my
silver<00:05:26.880> collection<00:05:27.060> outweighs<00:05:27.750> my<00:05:28.100> gold<00:05:29.100> by

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
silver collection outweighs my gold by

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.500 
silver collection outweighs my gold by
quite<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.640> bit<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:31.850> that's<00:05:32.850> because<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.390> is

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
quite a bit and that's because it is

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.750 
quite a bit and that's because it is

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
dollars that just be ridiculous overkill

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.360 
dollars that just be ridiculous overkill
instead<00:06:34.060> something<00:06:34.450> like<00:06:34.660> this<00:06:34.900> here<00:06:38.370> just

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
instead something like this here just

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.660 
instead something like this here just
one<00:06:39.880> ounce<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.240> silver<00:06:40.830> with<00:06:41.830> value<00:06:42.250> to<00:06:42.370> 20

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670 
one ounce of silver with value to 20

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:49.050 
one ounce of silver with value to 20
bucks<00:06:42.910> or<00:06:43.120> so<00:06:43.330> is<00:06:43.570> a<00:06:44.560> lot<00:06:45.040> better<00:06:46.920> for<00:06:48.060> just

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
bucks or so is a lot better for just

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.580 
bucks or so is a lot better for just
buying<00:06:49.270> little<00:06:49.600> things<00:06:49.810> like<00:06:49.960> food<00:06:50.200> and<00:06:50.260> them

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
buying little things like food and them

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.710 
buying little things like food and them
in<00:06:50.860> emergency<00:06:51.520> or<00:06:51.700> something<00:06:51.730> like<00:06:52.120> that<00:06:52.180> they

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
in emergency or something like that they

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.270 
in emergency or something like that they
just<00:06:52.870> think<00:06:53.050> about<00:06:53.110> coins<00:06:53.470> as<00:06:53.770> better<00:06:53.980> than

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
just think about coins as better than

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.010 
just think about coins as better than
bars<00:06:54.520> as<00:06:54.970> they<00:06:55.210> have<00:06:55.360> face<00:06:55.600> value<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:58.990> that

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
bars as they have face value so that

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.760 
bars as they have face value so that
they're<00:06:59.940> that<00:07:00.940> adds<00:07:01.150> value<00:07:01.270> as<00:07:01.660> well<00:07:03.900> so<00:07:04.900> yeah

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
they're that adds value as well so yeah

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.360 
they're that adds value as well so yeah
that's<00:07:06.070> my<00:07:06.220> recommendations<00:07:07.120> up<00:07:08.370> my

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370
