been changed and they're not too distant

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.590 
been changed and they're not too distant
past<00:04:49.410> but<00:04:49.830> clearly<00:04:50.190> could<00:04:51.000> do<00:04:51.180> with<00:04:51.360> another

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
past but clearly could do with another

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.120 
past but clearly could do with another
changing<00:04:53.630> that<00:04:54.630> fuel<00:04:54.960> pump<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.590> replaced

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
changing that fuel pump I replaced

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.640 
changing that fuel pump I replaced
recently<00:04:56.639> it's<00:04:57.479> working<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:57.900> fine<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.500> last

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
recently it's working just fine the last

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.950 
recently it's working just fine the last
one<00:04:59.010> worked<00:04:59.220> fine<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.880> original<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.479> but<00:05:00.840> it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
one worked fine the original one but it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.590 
one worked fine the original one but it
just<00:05:01.169> leaked<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.950> little<00:05:02.910> bit<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.389> wasn't

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
just leaked a little bit and I wasn't

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.390 
just leaked a little bit and I wasn't
obviously<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> wasn't<00:05:04.710> comfortable<00:05:05.130> with<00:05:05.250> that

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
obviously I wasn't comfortable with that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.060 
obviously I wasn't comfortable with that
so<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.610> changed<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.900> radiator<00:05:10.710> on

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
so I changed it here is the radiator on

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.990 
so I changed it here is the radiator on
this<00:05:11.880> Deere<00:05:12.150> thing<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:14.100> can<00:05:14.310> see<00:05:14.669> that

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
this Deere thing and you can see that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000 
this Deere thing and you can see that
there's<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.840> belt<00:05:16.080> coming<00:05:16.380> off<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.710> alternator

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
there's a belt coming off the alternator

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.140 
there's a belt coming off the alternator
that<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.960> turns<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.470> fan<00:05:19.740> there<00:05:20.130> it<00:05:20.700> hasn't

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
that that turns the fan there it hasn't

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.460 
that that turns the fan there it hasn't
leaked<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:22.440> hasn't<00:05:22.620> overheated<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.550> me<00:05:24.470> and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
leaked that hasn't overheated on me and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.850 
leaked that hasn't overheated on me and
I<00:05:26.340> consider<00:05:26.729> my<00:05:26.970> myself<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:28.050> suppose<00:05:28.410> lucky

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
I consider my myself I suppose lucky

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.409 
I consider my myself I suppose lucky
because<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.190> have<00:05:29.400> seen<00:05:29.700> several<00:05:29.970> others<00:05:30.389> that
