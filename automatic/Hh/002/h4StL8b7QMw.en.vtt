00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.800
 4 battles in a row received a blast of bk from the fucking 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.809
 a horde of whores and now what I decided 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.839
 write tutorial that is, you know 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.339
 Guide how to play arte went to 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.150
 test server and here i have here 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.080
 see the four arts and four different 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.540
 ways to play the art 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.530
 Now I will show it to you and 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.680
 will demonstrate fully and so 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.740
 we look at the first battle we hit the map 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 fishing bay look bitch carefully 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 on the opponent's setup so we have a mouse 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.930
 there is from 7 months 50b there he many basil 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.929
 there is a yaga e100 there is a babaha there is a moon cool 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.270
 like willow about it in the rival of all 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.000
 only one art as in our ranks too 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 one art and I play on it now 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 when the battle starts the first way how 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.380
 we must play on arte so we look 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.450
 carefully first look at 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 the enemy forces are visible 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 how many tanks 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.359
 near enemy base necessarily 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 drive up to the stone as much as possible 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:55.530
 closer and shoot what is the first time u 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.249
 we did not work out well waiting for 2 so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 the culmination of the first way to play the art 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:05.549
 so here you can play the harp is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.200
 only was the first way to drive up 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 me shoot him and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.870
 bitch when the last shit die 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.540
 look the next way so we 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.870
 looked at the setup carefully 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.010
 the enemy understood where the tank would go 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.459
 about 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.190
 and our second way begins for this 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.530
 don't even need recharge we just 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.330
 going forward now I will show you what 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.230
 need to 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.340
 do on art in the second case if 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.090
 let's say reluctance to be killed on a stone and 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.470
 so we go ahead 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.920
 Himmelsdorf's card is wonderful 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.120
 Gun Mount DHW is German 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 crazy just cannon which 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.280
 deals as much as two thousand damage if 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.700
 punches 105 and here is the art I 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.690
 tanking today we are with you 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.430

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.480
 arte now I'll show you 3 ways how 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.440
 need to play arte we went into battle on 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.959
 t92 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.990
 we have a map as you see the Arctic 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.980
 look at the opponent's setup to very 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.760
 serious situation 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.980
 4 artillery in each team puke 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.620
 Probably it will be a fucking fight. 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.970
 do the first thing we occupy 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.180
 position while we're going to position i 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.120
 I want to warn everyone 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.739
 guys please i'm very god of you 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.230
 novice world of tanks players 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.810
 do you play fuck on arte please 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.810
 experienced players of world of tanks do not play 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.390
 on art you understand that you are 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.430
 the cause of many 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.019
 broken monitors blown up a bunch of 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.340
 spent nerve and even probably 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.500
 suicides and so we drive very fast 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.650
 on varieties that 92 blyat as she 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.989
 rises okhuitelno trunk look at 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:11.830
 so we go to our position here 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 already stands up 155 drum chuizos 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:21.919
 so here we are almost reached our 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:24.020
 positions the best position on this 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.960
 map right over here is the most serious 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 best position on this map on arte 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.050
 here she is the bitch best position here and 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.210
 here we can even become sniper 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.150
 sight for this not to go 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:49.099
 it was guys the third way how to 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:52.069
 play world of tanks on arte and now 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.949
 there will be a fourth way so we hit 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:58.550
 storm on the map line zigfried judging by 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:04.130
 account located above we protect 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:11.060
 city ​​from the attack of enemy technology so 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:15.610
 we have players waiting 28 seconds to 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.610
 the beginning of the battle is nothing we will wait 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.450
 all the same this 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.340
 asap game he knows more of such light 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.230
 Well, in general, it is easy to play the art here 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.230
 they have nothing difficult gameplay 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.190
 as if now I will show you one more 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:43.180
 way so guys glitch we start 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.330
 go to sniper mode are reduced 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.020
 about somewhere in the enemy base 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:55.780
 press escape and exit bitch Vangar 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:59.040
 hangar go out bitch here it is guys four 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.660
 art four ways to play the art 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.780
 so it will be better to play less 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.050
 bombed farts and the result of the battle 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.860
 never depends on you look at 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.630
 there are no top players on them 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.870
 top players look at the players 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.800
 anyone statistics higher by 50 5 percent 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.470
 wins and higher 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.430
 one and a half thousand wh8 look at them 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.890
 statistics on art 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.320
 and you will see that there is less than 50 percent 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.270
 victories because art on not drags it 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.020
 can fight spoil one to two players 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.580
 maximum but she does not drag a fight because of her 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.460
 long recharge and 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.060
 because of its low armor and small 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.220
 quantities hp so i ask you 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.210
