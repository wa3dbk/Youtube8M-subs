the same time you keep failing it's

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.719 
the same time you keep failing it's
constant<00:01:29.770> sense<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.100> conflict<00:01:30.430> between

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
constant sense of conflict between

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.790 
constant sense of conflict between
wanting<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.300> be<00:01:31.390> controlled<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.229> then<00:01:32.290> chaos

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
wanting to be controlled and then chaos

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.580 
wanting to be controlled and then chaos
and<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:33.729> know<00:01:33.850> wanting<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.300> be<00:01:34.930> free<00:01:35.380> or

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
and you know wanting to be free or

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.130 
and you know wanting to be free or
wanting<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.860> be<00:01:35.979> safe<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.700> these<00:01:37.660> battles

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
wanting to be safe and these battles

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.410 
wanting to be safe and these battles
that<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.619> within<00:01:38.830> yourself<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:40.119> I

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
that you have within yourself and I

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.520 
that you have within yourself and I
think<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.350> lot<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:41.920> quite<00:01:42.190> conflicting

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
think a lot of it's quite conflicting

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.749 
think a lot of it's quite conflicting
which<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.649> think<00:01:44.830> maybe<00:01:44.950> leads<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.340> some<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.610> the

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
which I think maybe leads to some of the

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.950 
which I think maybe leads to some of the
violent<00:01:46.149> imagery<00:01:46.390> because<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.720> and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
violent imagery because you and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.820 
violent imagery because you and
literally<00:01:47.200> sort<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.590> doing

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.470 

every<00:01:56.460> time<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:56.730> seen<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.300> always

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
every time I've seen you you're always

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.110
