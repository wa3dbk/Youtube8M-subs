00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
is the one that's the least creamy out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
is the one that's the least creamy out
of<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> them<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.670> Clinique<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
of all of them and it's by Clinique and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.869 
of all of them and it's by Clinique and
this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> color<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.579> chubby

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
this is the color here it is the chubby

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.240 
this is the color here it is the chubby
eyeshadow<00:00:48.570> stick<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.379> shade<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> called

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
eyeshadow stick and the shade is called

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.279 
eyeshadow stick and the shade is called
ample<00:00:50.820> amber<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.449> wasn't<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:51.840> sure<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
ample amber I wasn't really sure if I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
ample amber I wasn't really sure if I
should<00:00:52.320> include<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.760> guess<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
should include this because I guess the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
should include this because I guess the
texture<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.840> quite<00:00:55.079> powdery<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.010> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
texture of it is quite powdery it's so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.709 
texture of it is quite powdery it's so
easy<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> blend<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> fingers<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.539> just

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
easy to blend with the fingers it's just

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
easy to blend with the fingers it's just
like<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> cream<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.340> decided<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like a cream so that's why I decided to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.130 
like a cream so that's why I decided to
include<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> video<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> is
