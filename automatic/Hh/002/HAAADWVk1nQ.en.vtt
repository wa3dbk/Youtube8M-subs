you might want to use some PB Blaster to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
you might want to use some PB Blaster to
loosen<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> bolt<00:01:35.939> before<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> take<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> off

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
loosen the bolt before you take it off

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
loosen the bolt before you take it off
there<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> point<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> bolt<00:01:38.579> will

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
there will be a point when the bolt will

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
there will be a point when the bolt will
just<00:01:38.939> keep<00:01:39.060> screwing<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.659> won't<00:01:39.780> actually

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
just keep screwing and it won't actually

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
just keep screwing and it won't actually
come<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
come all the way out that's because the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
come all the way out that's because the
shock<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.979> extending<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> basically<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
shock is extending and basically all the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
shock is extending and basically all the
pressures<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> bolt<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
pressures on the bolt and so what you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
pressures on the bolt and so what you
need<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> take<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
need to do to get it out is take what I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780 
need to do to get it out is take what I
did<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.229> took<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.560> six<00:01:49.829> inch<00:01:50.009> extension<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
did is I took my six inch extension and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
did is I took my six inch extension and
put<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.420> against<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> back<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> bolt<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
put it against the back of the bolt and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.069 
put it against the back of the bolt and
then<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.920> hammer<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> popped<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> out

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
then just a hammer and popped it out

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.600 
then just a hammer and popped it out
after<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> remove<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.590> strut<00:01:55.950> assembly<00:01:56.159> from

put<00:03:05.639> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:05.700> pressure<00:03:06.000> up<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.480> lines<00:03:06.659> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
put a little pressure up so it lines a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.289 
put a little pressure up so it lines a
whole<00:03:07.019> lot<00:03:07.170> better<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:08.280> take<00:03:08.730> put<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
whole lot better and then take put the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.960 
whole lot better and then take put the
the<00:03:09.599> bolt<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.680> bang<00:03:11.159> it<00:03:11.310> through<00:03:11.549> with<00:03:11.760> a

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the bolt in and bang it through with a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.839 
the bolt in and bang it through with a
rubber<00:03:12.239> mallet<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.780> once<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.590> stops<00:03:13.889> moving

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
rubber mallet and once it stops moving

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.059 
rubber mallet and once it stops moving
then<00:03:15.230> basically<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.319> can<00:03:16.470> screw<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:16.889> from

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
then basically you can screw it in from

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.250 
then basically you can screw it in from
there<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.090> you've<00:03:18.269> completed<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.959> rear

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
there so now you've completed one rear

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.869 
there so now you've completed one rear
make<00:03:19.859> sure<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.129> repeat<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.699> other<00:03:20.730> side

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
make sure to repeat on the other side

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.479 
make sure to repeat on the other side
and<00:03:21.419> after<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:22.859> going<00:03:23.069> on<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and after that we are going on with the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.610 
and after that we are going on with the
fronts<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.599> your<00:03:24.840> new<00:03:24.959> shocks<00:03:25.199> didn't<00:03:25.470> come
