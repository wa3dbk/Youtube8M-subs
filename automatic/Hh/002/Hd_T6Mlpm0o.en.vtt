00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello guys welcome one more day to the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.629
 channel day Sunday in trend 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.780
 today we are not going to talk about a trend 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.430
 of summer test especially but of a 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.830
 garment of a basic that has become 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.750
 in a temporary our closet and 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 I'm talking about the soft a garment 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.619
 caprio distro could be used in summer 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.689
 now we can see it throughout the year 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.699
 in our wardrobe those who know a 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.039
 little bit of my style you know that I adore 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.079
 and tips on cleaning not so much cleaning 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.599
 like summer I think if I had to 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.640
 say a perfect combination for me and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.800
 throughout the year we would take that 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 pierced a few drops 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.820
 I love wearing this kind of look that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.770
 and then very casual and informal truth 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.660
 it is also a matter not today 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.579
 Virtually all firms include 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 mission in their collections depend that 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.329
 the combination that is a perfect look for 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.969
 go to university anahuac also only 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.949
 very unique your weekend student there 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.780
 many types of shows to be able to carry 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.699
 in india there are not the classics that are 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.289
 the lot we use so much 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.969
 winter like in summer and then they're 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.070
 the alternatives that it offers us in each 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.979
 signature in three winter collections 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.159
 it's not the mister this this here is a 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.960
 Sun from 0 topshop and it's from this 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 winter as you see is a super fabric 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.080
 finite that mimics the fatty 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 the fact that it is finite that is let's say 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 little added does not mean that no 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.229
 we can take it because we do not encourage 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 a part above more sheltered carrying 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.040
 evidently means and then then here 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 I really liked wearing layers 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.940
 like an onion and pollen where 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.009
 forgetting that you are on the site 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.780
 this is a high-waisted short that was 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.910
 an alternative of zara in this winter 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.920
 It is also the typical bear that you can 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.360
 put in both summer and winter and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.119
 they are really the ones that I usually put 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 more and well how can we put it as 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 we can combine those without dying in the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.910
 I try the first thing of everything is to put you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 stockings of tardor what you 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.119
 You want me to be more chubby than you 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
 you feel better and it also depends a lot 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.200
 city where you help or if you are very cold 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.350
 the toilet and the truth is that I'm super 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.479
 chilera but I do not like anything American 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.330
 I like to go as very stuffed by that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.100
 better not and layers but the jackets I'm 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.890
 quite a reaction that obviously 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.229
 I put them but I try to put more 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.060
 warm and avoid when to go with a 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.680
 very fat jacket this kind of 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.660
 combinations with which to just put it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.269
 more with comfortable symptoms that's a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.250
 short sleeve t-shirt also the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.590
 I could build if you want more 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 forced and a change for me the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
 Cardigan is practically essential for 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.320
 put with this type of looks the chosen 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.170
 This sun that your viewer is selling is 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.850
 Levi's I looked at it with a belt and I 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.070
 I really like to tighten it so that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.220
 like a little aguadito and what I do as 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.980
 that the belt is bigger 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.280
 he did not fasten it to me, he squeezed me a lot and 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.800
 I put it from behind and something that 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.420
 come out and make this kind of knot that I 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.220
 I really like how it looks like this is one of 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.380
 my favorite albums do not put a lot 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.690
 both in summer and in winter I 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.910
 like the washing that is clear and good 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.880
 As you can see, combined with the stockings and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.290
 with some boots and as for the shoes 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.600
 they are the combinations and I like them more 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.240
 use are the boots and how is it 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.840
 commented before they put it with a coffee and 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.840
 a little bit 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.950
 and now we go for the mask more 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.080
 disheveled and it's actually the most 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.120
 simple because it is simply to put a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.209
 shirt one of the answers like that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.010
 the chota with bony and some shoes the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.690
 shoe with the chain helps the look 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.690
 case is much more complete 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.760
 the two do not have to star in 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.950
 An informal look can also make a 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.560
 crazy much more formal choosing a sun 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.659
 something finer or more dedicated and the part 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.549
 up according to him this is the most 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.319
 romantic the most formal of the combined 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.689
 with this transparent top with a blazer 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.689
 that makes shirt and shopping zeros 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.620
 and I have combined it with some shoes 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.990
 patent leather makes the complete look 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.730
 much more lady we can make a look 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.950
 totally different simply 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.050
 changing the top and the shoes you see 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.880
 that being the same pattern of light changes 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.709
 very much in essence simply 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.320
 changing the top what is this other top 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.650
 shorter and simpler and we can shoes 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.650
 heel 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.330
 and this is all guys I hope that I have 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.460
 liked this video and have some idea 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.220
 that you cheer up if you have cheered up 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 take the winter more now that it does not 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.340
 so cold so see you very soon 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.340
 in the next video
