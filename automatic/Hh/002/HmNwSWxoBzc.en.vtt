physics<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:32.149> energy<00:00:34.550> incredible<00:00:35.550> stuff

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
physics and energy incredible stuff

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
physics and energy incredible stuff
she's<00:00:36.000> taught<00:00:36.270> me<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.500> orbs

what she teaches she has some great

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.240 
what she teaches she has some great
books<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:45.350> because<00:00:46.350> she's<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.800> energy

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
books but because she's all about energy

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.029 
books but because she's all about energy
her<00:00:47.850> cards<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:49.110> energy<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.800> well

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
her cards are all about energy as well

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
her cards are all about energy as well
and<00:00:50.840> I've<00:00:51.840> been<00:00:52.079> using<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.469> recently

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and I've been using them recently

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.720 
and I've been using them recently
because<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:55.309> sometimes<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.699> just

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because you know what sometimes you just

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.139 
because you know what sometimes you just
need<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> change<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.730> change<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
need a change you know a change of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.189 
need a change you know a change of
energy<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.829> play<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.039> words<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:03.199> if

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
energy a little play on words so if

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.910 
energy a little play on words so if
you've<00:01:04.860> never<00:01:05.129> used<00:01:05.280> oracle<00:01:05.939> cards<00:01:06.270> before

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
you've never used oracle cards before

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
you've never used oracle cards before
oracle<00:01:07.920> cards<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:10.520> cards<00:01:11.520> 42<00:01:12.119> cards<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
oracle cards are cards 42 cards in a

she<00:01:39.600> encourages<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:41.670> them<00:01:42.000> be

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
she encourages you to have them be

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
she encourages you to have them be
reversed<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.860> she<00:01:44.460> has<00:01:44.490> reverse

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
reversed so that she has reverse

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
reversed so that she has reverse
meanings<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.140> love<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.860> because

meanings in here and I love that because

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.179 
meanings in here and I love that because
you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.299> each<00:01:48.540> card<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.290> has<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:50.430> meanings

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
you know each card then has two meanings

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.460 
you know each card then has two meanings
she<00:01:53.189> has<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.909> cool<00:01:54.149> spread<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.930> here

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
she has a really cool spread in here

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
she has a really cool spread in here
that<00:01:56.040> she<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.250> several<00:01:56.520> spreads<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that she has several spreads but one is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.100 
that she has several spreads but one is
called<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> road<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.009> she<00:01:59.869> encourages<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
called the road and she encourages you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.429 
called the road and she encourages you
to<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.590> seven<00:02:02.219> cards<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to put seven cards and then go down a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.039 
to put seven cards and then go down a
row<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> seven<00:02:05.640> cars<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.329> seven<00:02:06.630> cards

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
row and do seven cars and seven cards

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.800 
row and do seven cars and seven cards
and<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> read<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.599> how

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and and read them through and see how

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.210 
and and read them through and see how
they<00:02:10.050> work<00:02:10.410> together<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.160> combine<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.580> mess

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
they work together to combine a mess

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.830 
they work together to combine a mess
and<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:13.270> course<00:02:13.770> oracle<00:02:14.770> cards<00:02:15.220> are<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:16.570> tool

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and of course oracle cards are a tool

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.500 
and of course oracle cards are a tool
for<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.320> connect<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.340> angels<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
for you to connect with the angels and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.600 
for you to connect with the angels and
eventually<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.200> stop<00:02:23.710> using<00:02:23.980> oracle

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
eventually for you to stop using oracle

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.460 
eventually for you to stop using oracle
cards<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.210> move<00:02:25.390> on<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.870> using<00:02:26.080> your<00:02:26.320> own

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
cards and move on to using your own

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.200 
cards and move on to using your own
intuition<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:29.700> wanted<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.910> see

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
intuition and so I wanted you to see

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.330 
intuition and so I wanted you to see
what<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> readings<00:02:32.230> were<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:33.190> these

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
what the readings were like from these

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.860 
what the readings were like from these
cards<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:33.940> I've<00:02:34.390> pulled<00:02:34.660> three<00:02:34.960> cards<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:36.870> one

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
cards so I've pulled three cards and one

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.330
