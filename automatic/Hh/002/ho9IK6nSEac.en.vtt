hi guys,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.590
On today's What I Ate Wednesday, I'm sharing
some of the tasty vegan meals that I had over

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.519
the past weekend.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.150
The weekend starts on Friday nights for me.
And because I like to make my Friday nights

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.020
wild and exciting, i made something spicy.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.700
You've seen me make this vegan butter chicken
dish before. It was even better than the one

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.840
you saw in my Cheater Butter Chicken video
because it has oyster mushrooms. I cannot

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
describe how perfect oyster mushrooms are
for this dish, you're just going to have to

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.469
try it yourself.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.249
And I haven't made naan in a million years
so I made some. And it was wonderful. Soft,

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.940
chewy, nom-tastic.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.809
The next morning, I had the leftovers for
breakfast.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.559
For lunch, I wanted to try this Vegan Parm
that I got in my last vegan cuts box. Please

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.789
let me know if you want to see a review on
that box because I wrote down what my boyfriend

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.370
and I thought of everything but it's honestly
really brutal and I don't want to express

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.870
too much negativity on this channel.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.730
But anyways, we decided the best way to judge
the parm was to put it on red sauce. So here

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.830
I have a vegetable bolognese made in a kind
of Hong Kong style which is a lot sweeter

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.950
than the kind I've had in Italian restaurants
back in my omni days.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.910
This was pretty delicious. The Parm was very
convincing. My boyfriend said he wouldn't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.640
be able to tell it wasn't real parmesan if
he didn't already know what it was.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.040
It reminded me of the cheap shaker Kraft parmesan.
After a few bites though, I think maybe I

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.950
don't love that taste anymore. I would have
enjoyed the dish just as much or maybe more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.060
without the parm.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.960
I didn't record for the rest of the day as
we just had random snacks throughout.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.430
On Sunday morning, I wanted noodles. These
noodles were cooked, then dry fried with madras

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.490
curry powder and a little vegetable broth
and soy sauce for flavour.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.310
The edamame and local heirloom tomatoes got
a similar treatment. Water sauteed along with

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.020
leek, garlic, ginger and scallion whites.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.720
It doesn't look super great as the turmeric
in the curry powder made everything yellow

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.590
but it tasted good.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.569
Sundays are either prep days or use everything
up days and the things I needed to use up

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.040
were an Yves Veggie dog and some vegan smoked
gouda from Daiya.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.579
The recipe is basically the same as my 5 ingredient
sausage buns except I added a few tablespoon

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.010
of fresh ground flax.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.099
I also brushed on a mix of maple syrup diluted
with plant-milk on top of the buns to give

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.959
some sweetness and browning on the tops.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.720
After about 15 minutes, they came out golden
and beautiful.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.260
I had them with creamy red bell pepper sauce
from Bryant Terry's Afro-Vegan cookbook which

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.400
I just did a review on. which Spoiler Alert,
I loved.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.310
Really really good. I just love dipping food
in food.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
And that's it for the foods that I filmed
over the weekend. I hope you got ideas for

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.340
what kinds of vegan foods you can cook up
in your own kitchen.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.190
Let me know what your favourite weekend vegan
meals or snacks are. I'd love to get some

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.790
more ideas from you.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.730
Thanks so much for watching.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.459
Bye for now!
