00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
they were one so you're going to take

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.199 
they were one so you're going to take
these<00:03:03.590> two<00:03:03.860> stitches<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.879> you're<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.150> to

go into both of them as if to knit and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.229 
go into both of them as if to knit and
now<00:03:09.799> you're<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.129> to<00:03:10.190> wrap<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.670> yarn<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:11.060> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
now you're going to wrap the yarn is to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.600 
now you're going to wrap the yarn is to
knit<00:03:12.040> pull<00:03:13.209> through<00:03:14.209> MIT<00:03:14.420> wise<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.989> pop<00:03:15.680> both

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
knit pull through MIT wise and pop both

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.569 
knit pull through MIT wise and pop both
of<00:03:16.940> these<00:03:17.120> off<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.440> loop<00:03:18.620> i'm<00:03:19.190> going<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> set

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
of these off the loop i'm going to set

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:30.520 
of these off the loop i'm going to set
up<00:03:19.700> for<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.940> next<00:03:20.000> one<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:26.170> 64

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.100 

56<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.160> with<00:03:32.370> each<00:03:32.640> decrease<00:03:33.570> round<00:03:33.780> you're

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
56 and with each decrease round you're

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.080 
56 and with each decrease round you're
going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.320> have<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.740> less<00:03:35.160> decrease<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:35.940> this

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
going to have one less decrease so this

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.400 
going to have one less decrease so this
one<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.270> going<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.510> six<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.020> then<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.230> two

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
one is going to be six and then it two

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.650 
one is going to be six and then it two
together<00:03:37.560> next<00:03:38.520> will<00:03:38.610> be<00:03:38.640> five<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
together next will be five and it's you

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.520 
together next will be five and it's you
together<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.020> so<00:03:40.410> forth<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.870> got<00:03:43.290> two

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
together and so forth and again got two

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.490 
together and so forth and again got two
stitches<00:03:44.450> I'm<00:03:45.450> going<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.630> go<00:03:45.750> into<00:03:45.900> both<00:03:46.230> of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
stitches I'm going to go into both of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.180 
stitches I'm going to go into both of
them<00:03:46.710> as<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.180> knit<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.380> I'll<00:03:49.560> wrap<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
yarn as to knit pull stitch through and

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.790 
yarn as to knit pull stitch through and
then<00:03:55.770> take<00:03:55.950> both<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.310> these<00:03:56.790> two<00:03:57.060> stitches<00:03:57.800> and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
then take both of these two stitches and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.610 
then take both of these two stitches and
pluck<00:03:59.040> them<00:03:59.220> off<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.700> needle<00:04:00.000> or<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.600> had<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.380> I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
pluck them off the needle or I had to I

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.030 
pluck them off the needle or I had to I
now<00:04:02.430> have<00:04:02.670> one<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.240> can<00:04:03.600> see<00:04:03.870> which<00:04:04.830> way

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
now have one and you can see which way

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.100 
now have one and you can see which way
that<00:04:05.070> decrease<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.360> course<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.900> that
