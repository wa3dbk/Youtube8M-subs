triple-a<00:00:39.540> batteries<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.440> simply<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.860> your

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
triple-a batteries you simply have your

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
triple-a batteries you simply have your
USB<00:00:41.160> port<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> top<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.510> lift<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> plastic

USB port at the top to lift the plastic

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
USB port at the top to lift the plastic
up<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> covers<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.280> also

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
up there see it covers it is also

up there see it covers it is also
water-resistant<00:00:45.980> cable<00:00:46.980> comes<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
water-resistant cable comes with the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.750 
water-resistant cable comes with the
head<00:00:48.000> torch<00:00:48.210> itself<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.140> simply<00:00:49.469> just

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
head torch itself and you simply just

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
head torch itself and you simply just
plug<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> cable<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> obviously

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
plug the cable in like so and obviously

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
plug the cable in like so and obviously
this<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.610> plug<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> port<00:00:54.270> in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this then you just plug into a port in

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970 
this then you just plug into a port in
your<00:00:54.420> computer<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.530> happen<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> have

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
your computer if you do happen to have

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500 
your computer if you do happen to have
one<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> mains<00:00:56.520> adapters<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.270> obviously

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
one of the mains adapters that obviously

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
one of the mains adapters that obviously
plugs<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.829> mains<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> wall<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
plugs into the the mains on a wall you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
plugs into the the mains on a wall you
can<00:00:59.910> obviously<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.629> well

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
can obviously use that as well

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
can obviously use that as well
if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.500> using<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.219> mains<00:01:02.730> adapter<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
if you are using the mains adapter it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.910 
if you are using the mains adapter it
takes<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.989> four<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> half<00:01:04.470> hours<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
takes just four and a half hours to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
takes just four and a half hours to
charge<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.430> battery<00:01:05.790> fully<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.479> you're<00:01:06.570> using

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
charge the battery fully if you're using

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.120 
charge the battery fully if you're using
your<00:01:06.810> computer<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> takes<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.590> six<00:01:07.920> hours

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
your computer it takes about six hours

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
your computer it takes about six hours
obviously<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.700> worth<00:01:08.850> keeping<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.540> mind

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
obviously just worth keeping in mind

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.350 
obviously just worth keeping in mind
when<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> come<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.710> recharge<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.180> terms

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
when you come to recharge it so in terms

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
when you come to recharge it so in terms
of<00:01:12.450> its<00:01:12.540> design<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.290> you've<00:01:13.409> got

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of its design as you see if you've got

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
of its design as you see if you've got
two<00:01:13.710> simple<00:01:14.130> buttons<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
two simple buttons on the top on the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
two simple buttons on the top on the
side<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.930> top<00:01:16.170> button<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.920> turn<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.280> like

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
side the top button just turn it on like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
side the top button just turn it on like
so<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.170> will

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so now as you can see this will

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
so now as you can see this will
immediately<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> into<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> mode<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
immediately take you into a mode and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.950 
immediately take you into a mode and
this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.060> what's<00:01:21.210> known<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> reactive

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this is what's known as the reactive

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
this is what's known as the reactive
lighting<00:01:22.350> mode<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> moment<00:01:23.549> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
lighting mode at the moment it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.740 
lighting mode at the moment it's
flashing<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> let<00:01:24.299> us<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
flashing just to let us know that it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
flashing just to let us know that it's
too<00:01:25.080> bright<00:01:25.350> obviously<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.979> using<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
too bright obviously to be using the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
too bright obviously to be using the
head<00:01:26.610> torch<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.540> flashes<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> case

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
head torch and it just flashes in case

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
head torch and it just flashes in case
you've<00:01:28.320> left<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.680> by<00:01:28.860> accident<00:01:29.119> now<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you've left it on by accident now if I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
you've left it on by accident now if I
just<00:01:30.390> over<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
just over here as you can see you just
