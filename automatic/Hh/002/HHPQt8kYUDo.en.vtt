00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
one I paid for the fake one $12 on dhk

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.090 
one I paid for the fake one $12 on dhk
calm<00:00:40.420> so<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:41.690> $12<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:42.350> get<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:42.770> watch<00:00:43.070> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.849 
calm so for $12 you get this watch that
looks<00:00:43.610> pretty<00:00:44.510> much<00:00:44.750> like<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.230> original<00:00:45.320> one

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
looks pretty much like the original one

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.669 
looks pretty much like the original one
the<00:00:46.640> original<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.269> I<00:00:47.329> believe<00:00:47.660> I<00:00:47.750> paid<00:00:48.019> about

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
the original and I believe I paid about

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.020 
the original and I believe I paid about
a<00:00:48.859> hundred<00:00:49.340> bucks<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:49.730> it

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
a hundred bucks for it

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.299 
a hundred bucks for it
and<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.929> was<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> year<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.589> year<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:52.100> half

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
and that was a year a year and a half

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.360 
and that was a year a year and a half
ago<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.870> let's<00:00:53.989> take<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.260> closer<00:00:54.620> look<00:00:54.769> at<00:00:55.129> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
ago so let's take a closer look at the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.959 
ago so let's take a closer look at the
both<00:00:55.730> of<00:00:55.760> them<00:00:56.859> as<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.519> fake<00:00:58.760> one

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
both of them as you can see the fake one

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.279 
both of them as you can see the fake one
it's<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.530> shinier<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:00.859> believe<00:01:01.460> that's<00:01:01.730> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
it's a shinier but I believe that's the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.920 
it's a shinier but I believe that's the
model<00:01:03.289> that's<00:01:04.100> all<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.430> model<00:01:04.730> is<00:01:04.879> with<00:01:05.810> this

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
model that's all the model is with this

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.450 
model that's all the model is with this
particular<00:01:06.440> color<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:10.010> if<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.190> give<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
particular color so if we give the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.940 
particular color so if we give the
g-shock<00:01:11.060> right<00:01:11.330> here<00:01:11.690> one<00:01:12.170> thing<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.470> noticed

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
g-shock right here one thing I noticed

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.580 
g-shock right here one thing I noticed
the<00:01:13.130> buttons<00:01:13.580> don't<00:01:13.820> actually<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:15.560> they

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the buttons don't actually do what they

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.980 
the buttons don't actually do what they
say<00:01:16.370> they<00:01:16.550> do<00:01:16.730> for<00:01:16.970> example<00:01:17.060> if<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.720> press

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
say they do for example if you press

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950 
say they do for example if you press
this<00:01:18.229> one<00:01:18.530> die<00:01:18.890> just<00:01:19.280> button<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.000> screen

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960

this one die just button the screen
lights<00:01:21.320> up<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.220> original<00:01:22.670> one<00:01:22.899> spinning

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
lights up on the original one spinning

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.050 
lights up on the original one spinning
lights<00:01:24.259> up<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.740> press<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.250> G<00:01:25.579> button<00:01:25.820> at

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
the bottom when they do light up well

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.050 
the bottom when they do light up well
you're<00:01:29.869> going<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.079> see<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.380> fake<00:01:30.590> one<00:01:30.770> has

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
you're going to see the fake one has

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.340 
you're going to see the fake one has
sent<00:01:32.060> some<00:01:32.390> type<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.630> G<00:01:33.290> right<00:01:34.250> there

sent some type of G right there

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.139 
sent some type of G right there
the<00:01:36.350> original<00:01:36.740> one<00:01:36.860> doesn't<00:01:37.280> actually<00:01:37.729> have

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
the original one doesn't actually have

the original one doesn't actually have
that

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.100 

on<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.220> side<00:01:43.670> here<00:01:44.000> they<00:01:44.210> look<00:01:44.450> pretty

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
on the side here they look pretty

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.860 
on the side here they look pretty
similar

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
similar

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.400 
similar
again<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.250> screws<00:01:49.250> aren't<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.120> same<00:01:50.720> like

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.320 
again the screws aren't the same like
this<00:01:51.620> screw<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> fake<00:01:52.400> one<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:52.640> much

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
this screw on the fake one it's much

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.510 
this screw on the fake one it's much
bigger<00:01:53.600> than<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.990> screw<00:01:54.260> on<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.520> original

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
bigger than the screw on the original

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:05.890 
bigger than the screw on the original
one<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:02.180> straps<00:02:02.600> look<00:02:03.440> similar<00:02:04.720> however<00:02:05.720> this

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
one the straps look similar however this

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.880 
one the straps look similar however this
one<00:02:06.080> it's<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.410> thinner<00:02:07.100> than<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.790> original<00:02:08.450> one

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.760 

also<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.370> original<00:02:13.820> one<00:02:14.210> has<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:15.350> made<00:02:15.590> of

also the original one has this made of
plastic<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.570> fake<00:02:17.780> ones<00:02:18.020> made<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.470> metal

plastic and the fake ones made of metal

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.520 
plastic and the fake ones made of metal
I'm<00:02:19.280> not<00:02:19.490> sure<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.840> model<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.350> comes

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
I'm not sure if the the model that comes

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.800 
I'm not sure if the the model that comes
in<00:02:21.740> this<00:02:21.920> color<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.550> actually<00:02:23.540> got<00:02:23.690> this

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
in this color it's actually got this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.449 
in this color it's actually got this
made<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.290> metal<00:02:24.740> or<00:02:24.830> not

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.710 

on<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.610> back<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> fake<00:02:34.510> one<00:02:35.849> it's<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.180> bit

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
on the back of the fake one it's a bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.660 
on the back of the fake one it's a bit
different<00:02:38.290> than<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.519> other<00:02:39.670> one<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:42.519> can

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
different than the the other one you can

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.070 
different than the the other one you can
see<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:42.970> model<00:02:43.330> number<00:02:43.360> right<00:02:43.810> there

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
see the model number right there

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
see the model number right there
DW<00:02:44.709> 6900<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:46.290> don't<00:02:47.290> believe<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:47.950> actually

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
DW 6900 I don't believe this is actually

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.119 
DW 6900 I don't believe this is actually
waterproof<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.379> don't<00:02:50.440> think<00:02:50.860> I'm<00:02:50.980> gonna

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
waterproof and I don't think I'm gonna

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.430 
waterproof and I don't think I'm gonna
try<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:53.980> original<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:55.060> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
try it and this is the original one so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.640 
try it and this is the original one so
the<00:02:56.440> backs<00:02:56.650> are<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.950> bit<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:58.079> bit<00:02:59.079> different<00:02:59.530> but

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the backs are a bit a bit different but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.830 
the backs are a bit a bit different but
that<00:02:59.709> could<00:03:00.099> be<00:03:00.129> because<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.180> an

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that could be because this one it's an

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.339 
that could be because this one it's an
older<00:03:02.230> model<00:03:02.260> than<00:03:02.799> this<00:03:03.040> one<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.110> maybe<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
older model than this one so maybe the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.509 
older model than this one so maybe the
newer<00:03:06.239> DW<00:03:07.239> 6900<00:03:08.170> are<00:03:08.769> actually<00:03:09.220> made<00:03:09.400> with

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
newer DW 6900 are actually made with

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.559 
newer DW 6900 are actually made with
this<00:03:09.730> handle<00:03:10.120> back<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:16.359> look<00:03:16.540> pretty

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
this handle back so they look pretty

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:42.610 
this handle back so they look pretty
similar<00:03:17.049> except<00:03:17.650> for<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.129> screws<00:03:18.940> here

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.790 

see<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.580> one<00:03:43.790> actually<00:03:44.270> comes<00:03:45.200> up<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.530> change

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
see this one actually comes up to change

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.040 
see this one actually comes up to change
the<00:03:46.130> time<00:03:46.790> by<00:03:46.940> pressing<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.450> button<00:03:47.510> three

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
the time by pressing this button three

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.589 
the time by pressing this button three
times<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.370> adjust<00:03:49.730> button<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.360> turns

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
times and the adjust button just turns

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.750 
times and the adjust button just turns
on<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.959> light<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.470> that's<00:03:52.280> how<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.550> can

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
on the light so that's how you can

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.880 
on the light so that's how you can
actually<00:03:53.650> see<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.800> this<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.220> fake<00:03:56.890> thanks

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890
