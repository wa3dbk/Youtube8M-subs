00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.950
 the doctor jose felix peiró ibáñez is 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.690
 ophthalmologist and belongs to the doctors the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.150
 select circle of doctors closeup 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.009
 level of Spain as an expert in lenses 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.120
 intraocular will explain the details 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.120
 of this surgery 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.740
 what are intraocular lenses 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.099
 from time immemorial the operation of 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.919
 cataracts has been done and they have 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.800
 found until archaeological remains in 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.110
 Egyptian excavations in the operation of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.449
 cataract was an operation that was done 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.629
 when the patient practically no longer 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.280
 saw nothing then it consisted of a 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.489
 way or another in removing the lens 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.409
 by removing the lens that is where it 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.780
 form the cataract we also remove the 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.940
 eye lens so all the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.100
 patients operated on for cataracts should 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.430
 wear a glasses of a very graduation 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 strong for 14 or 15 days when they existed 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.089
 ar gazas subsequently had always been 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 thought about replacing the lens by 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.240
 some lens or by some kind of 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.369
 adaptation inside the eye until the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 World War II that was ridley a 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.250
 English ophthalmologist who proved that the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.140
 raf pilots who were injured with 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.450
 cockpit wounds that was of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.060
 plastic with pieces of plastic inside 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 of the eye and they tolerated this 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.780
 plastic and it occurred to him 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.280
 a lens of this same plastic is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.540
 really performed is really from 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.820
 ridley was the first to be 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.120
 implanted inside one eye but by the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.030
 weight stability reasons of this 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.570
 lens was finished leaving later 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.460
 and later from the 80s 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.050
 already began to make some lenses 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.390
 intraocular that were tolerated 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.640
 perfectly these lenses have 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.979
 evolved a lot and lately not 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 only used to replace the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.729
 crystalline cataracts or let's say you have 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.190
 a cataract but they are also used 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.740
 to correct other defects for 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.619
 correct myopia astigmatism 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.369
 hyperopia and lately for 4 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.380
 or 5 years there are also some lenses 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.620
 a multifocal lens these lenses 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.380
 multifocal can leave us without glasses 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.350
 for far and for close this is the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.020
 origin of intraocular lenses a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.080
 intraocular lens has a maximum of 13 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.090
 millimeters in diameter and this has 13 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.820
 centimeters but this is the aspect and of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.680
 this way with these flexible optics 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.579
 adapts 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.579
 the inner capsule 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.030
 what pathologies can be corrected 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.010
 thanks to its implementation 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.900
 thanks to the implantation of the lenses 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.480
 intraocular there are numerous pathologies 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.230
 that can be corrected as we said 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 before myopia hyperopia astigmatism 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.920
 the latter with new lenses that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.220
 they have come out that are called toric lenses 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.770
 and correct the astigmatism perfectly 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.720
 currently with these biometrics 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.270
 new ones that are made 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.870
 by means of the laser, we achieved a 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.850
 an almost perfect lens at your graduation 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 for the patient with which we can 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.670
 correct myopia to whomever you want 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.070
 correct your myopia hyperopia and the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.260
 astigmatism in this must be taken into 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.600
 account that some myopic especially of 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 two or three days prefer to stay a 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 little myopic since the vision that 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.200
 he has nearsightedness when removing his 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.489
 glasses is very good and many times this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.350
 you have to take it into account in the story 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.180
 of the patient because each lens must 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.910
 be adapted to what you prefer to 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.580
 patient to his profession or his to his 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.930
 hobbies or your exercises that you do 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.290
 after the implementation of the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.290
 lens 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.390
 what advantages do they offer for the patient? 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120
 The main advantage offered by 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.670
 intraocular lenses for the patient is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.920
 not have to use those bio trias so 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.359
 large that were formerly used 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.359
 when they did not wear the lenses 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.189
 intraocular also the advantage that 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.959
 offer for the patient is the current 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.200
 cataract intervention technique 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.470
 which is only with topical anesthesia is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.359
 say with drops that lasts is very brief in 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.650
 expert hands is very short is 15 to 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.120
 20 minutes 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.500
 is done without giving points and that also 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.259
 it is done in a traveling way, that is, the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.090
 patient should not enter is operated and 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.039
 going home with his eye uncovered is not 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.539
 cover the eye in no time and 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.330
 incorporates practically his normal life 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.100
 except violent exercises and another type 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.990
 of things that they can not do but 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.550
 can 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.750
 the next day they may be doing 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.750
 your normal activity
