00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
around a little bit cameraman to get

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.970 
around a little bit cameraman to get
them<00:03:47.330> getting<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.750> movement<00:03:48.170> if<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.590> see

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980

where<00:03:49.190> your<00:03:49.310> balance<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:49.790> when<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.030> first<00:03:50.239> set

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
where your balance is when you first set

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.640 
where your balance is when you first set
it<00:03:50.540> out<00:03:50.660> there<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.930> want<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.140> little<00:03:51.290> bit<00:03:51.349> more

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
then go ahead and get you a little bit

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.420 
then go ahead and get you a little bit
more<00:03:53.630> pitch<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.319> because<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.190> pitch

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
more pitch to it because the more pitch

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.190 
more pitch to it because the more pitch
you<00:03:55.580> put<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.300> first<00:03:56.510> breeze<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:57.050> going

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
you put in it the first breeze is going

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.020 
you put in it the first breeze is going
to<00:03:57.290> pick<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.530> up<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.980> make<00:03:58.550> it<00:03:58.730> look<00:03:58.880> more

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
to pick it up and make it look more

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.600 
to pick it up and make it look more
natural<00:03:59.500> now<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:00.560> don't<00:04:00.739> have<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.130> about<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> 5

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
natural now we don't have it about a 5

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.820 
natural now we don't have it about a 5
mile<00:04:01.910> an<00:04:02.000> hour<00:04:02.090> wind<00:04:02.390> right<00:04:02.660> now<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.620> see

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the floating action we're getting okay

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.640 
the floating action we're getting okay
just<00:04:06.709> keep<00:04:06.890> watching<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:08.650> come<00:04:11.470> loose<00:04:12.470> just

on around there big boy okay you see we
got<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.940> upward<00:04:26.300> wing<00:04:26.570> action<00:04:27.110> right<00:04:27.290> here

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
got the upward wing action right here

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.890 
got the upward wing action right here
that<00:04:28.370> upward<00:04:28.729> wing<00:04:29.000> when<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.330> freezes<00:04:29.570> in

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
that upward wing when it freezes in

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
as it relaxes it'll give you more action

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.980 
as it relaxes it'll give you more action
and<00:04:54.080> get<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.350> more<00:04:54.650> natural<00:04:55.190> look<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.639> as<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
and get a more natural look to it as a

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.930 
and get a more natural look to it as a
