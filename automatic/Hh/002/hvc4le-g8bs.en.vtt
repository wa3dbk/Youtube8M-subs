 so pull in the middle so 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 we do not need text files broken 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.850
 Clear 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.110

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.440

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.500

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:10.320
 hard disk c at least program 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.190
 files under the steam folder if it is the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:19.310
 folder since you scroll down then go 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.750

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.660
 then arise on your play in this 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.320
 case could strike on it and source 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.880
 then very important on box 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.940
 In the past people did it differently 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.940
 has just generate the skins in here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.010
 you do not do that anymore 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 the last big update 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.600
 Now you have to custom in the box above 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.910
 folder in and when in there since 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.200
 to create a new folder 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 because we remove so if you in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.880
 this box folder is just new 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.860
 Folder can create the arbitrary 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.989

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.250

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.910

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:29.120
 Radmutter likes to mark the draws 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.079
 once here and have finished what 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.760
 then close again 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.760
 then the new game goes in 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:50.280

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:54.960
