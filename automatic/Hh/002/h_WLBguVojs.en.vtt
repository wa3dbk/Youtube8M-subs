 so there I contact me to hasten 50 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.559
 acts and test different systems of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.190
 security the first is called the day before 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.559
 automatic 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.900
 it's a device that lets you stop 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.640
 the train in case of failure of my 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.219

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.399
 2.5 seconds 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.129
 the automatic shut-off device 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.039
 work starts up ie the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.860
 emergency braking 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.100

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.100
 doors 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.930
 what I like in a relative 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.370
 autonomy even you are quiet 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.360
 regularly bidding in higher 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.420
 soon three weeks 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 the workforce is to locate its staff 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.960
 destiny type 2 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280
 you are well in your head proven 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.110
 but these gentlemen the double-edged 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.330
 joa 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.890
 you can spend my workday 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.159
 are in touch and thousands of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.689
 people and 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.429
 finally see none of your day 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.719
 that before going to scenes I 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.319
 worked five years in the big 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.490
 distribution 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.649
 in the province the team liked but 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.929
 the craft was growing to ten 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.939
 this is an opportunity I was told 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.130
 a sncf in it we find quite a lot 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.819
 to jostle on sailboats of these 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.520
 applications 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.530
 a body a bet and two months after 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.979
 guess to spread bets to pass the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.030
 interviews my future at seven days the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.240
 everything should roll to the mans few 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.240
 years 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.560
 the formation of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.610
 traction transport 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.610
 between sm for that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.220
 this training will lead us to manage a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.220
 team of mechanics 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.070
 nature and their competence 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.070
 quality
