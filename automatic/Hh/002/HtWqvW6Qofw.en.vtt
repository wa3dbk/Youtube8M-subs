00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
 We are interested Heron is a pride for me 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.470
 be with one of the favorite Latinas 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.230
 of hollywood and how about how are you very 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.210
 well very happy with this this new 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.610
 intergalactic film adventure 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.950
 tell us what you want me to take with you 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.800
 tell all how you can be part of 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.570
 the crew is a blessing a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.669
 blessing to be able to work again with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.680
 the cast and with gigi we go again 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.110
 because we really enjoyed the experience 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.579
 of having created to be together the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.710
 first installation 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.640
 this second time we came back with more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 bravery with a healthier budget 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 therefore he gave him the ability to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 create bigger sets and us 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.900
 the power to have more freedom of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 evolve won us our character 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.550
 where we thought they should be 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.490
 they and they watched to play a little 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.510
 more taking terrain in the area by 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.100
 example the relationship with with is for good 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.200
 being that she already feels a lot 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.149
 pain because I know that she feels that he 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.780
 has the ability to feel to feel 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.570
 much more because he is half and half 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.659
 and also she sees how he fights a lot 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.470
 against that and suffer as a result of 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.759
 continue denying his human side 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.540
 then what I liked most about this 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.610
 second installation is that which you 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.790
 I say the conflict that has cure with 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.100
 spock is well parallel to the conflict that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.430
 is having the marc captain as spock 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.530
 which is like seeing this individual that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.540
 whether he feels mass that we use his 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.869
 instincts and not be such a person 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.509
 rational I love that because it gives 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.030
 much human value now what was one of 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.119
 the biggest challenges of playing kurt 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.979
 what it was to have the little dress so 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.110
 tight that I have then he gave me 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.560
 I was very much limited in terms 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.240
 of how I could move and well that's 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.710
 one of the secrets behind cameras 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.019
 now something else had once 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.360
 you imagined star trek is a franchise 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.080
 super important you ever imagined 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 that you were going to travel to the stars 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.270
 but I would have liked always dreamed 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.310
 with doing it and now being an artist and 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.820
 making movies having the skill 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.230
 to be part of stories that are very 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.660
 creative 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.020
 and collaborate with directors who do not 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.850
 They limit me a lot 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.610
 because I can learn a lot and grow 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.380
 as a person and it's also I do not know about my 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.640
 dreams come true also also 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.060
 and very important also the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.130
 Latino participation 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.400
 How does it feel to represent the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.020
 Andean people, I am very proud that 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.130
 that by staying in one in an area 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.500
 very neutral 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.760
 I am part of a community of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.590
 artists that do not want to be 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.710
 identified by their race for their 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.290
 genres but because of his talent because to me 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.470
 I would like to see one day the day where a 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.470
 Latino artist is hired and wanted 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.820
 for its artistic attribute and not for its 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.130
 race 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.810
 what yes very many thanks congratulations 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.810
 has been in the successes of saga
